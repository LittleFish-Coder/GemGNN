## Pipeline Architecture Overview

### Graph Construction Pipeline (`build_hetero_graph.py`)

The heterogeneous graph construction pipeline implements a sophisticated approach to modeling news articles and their interactions:

**Core Components:**
- **Node Types**: 
  - `news` nodes: Represent news articles with DeBERTa-based embeddings
  - `interaction` nodes: Represent user interactions and engagement patterns
- **Edge Construction**: Multiple policies for connecting related articles
  - `knn`: K-nearest neighbor connections based on content similarity
  - `knn_test_isolated`: KNN with test set isolation to prevent data leakage
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Dissimilar sampling for diverse training examples
  - Test labeled neighbor enforcement for improved generalization
  - Partial unlabeled sampling with configurable factors

**Key Parameters:**
- K-neighbors: (3, 5, 7) for content-based connections
- Multiview settings: (0, 3, 6) for incorporating multiple perspectives
- Edge policies: Ensuring proper train/test separation
- Sampling strategies: Balancing labeled and unlabeled data

### Training Pipeline (`train_hetero_graph.py`)

The training pipeline employs HAN (Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network) architecture optimized for few-shot learning:

**Model Architecture:**
- **Base Model**: HAN with 64 hidden channels
- **Attention Mechanism**: 4 attention heads for capturing diverse relationships
- **Dropout**: 0.3 for regularization
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy with early stopping (patience=30)

**Optimization Strategy:**
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-4 with Adam optimizer
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-3 for L2 regularization
- **Training Duration**: Up to 300 epochs with early stopping
- **Few-shot Learning**: 3-16 shot scenarios for practical applicability

### Experimental Design (`script/comprehensive_experiments.sh`)

The experimental framework systematically explores the parameter space:

**Parameter Combinations:**
- **Datasets**: GossipCop, PolitiFact
- **Shot Counts**: 3-16 for comprehensive few-shot analysis
- **K-neighbors**: 3, 5, 7 for different connectivity levels
- **Edge Policies**: knn, knn_test_isolated for data leakage prevention
- **Multiview**: 0, 3, 6 for multi-perspective modeling
- **Feature Engineering**: With/without dissimilar sampling and test neighbor enforcement

**Total Experiments**: 108 configurations across both datasets
