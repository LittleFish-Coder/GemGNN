# Comprehensive Results Analysis and Pipeline Validation for Heterogeneous Graph-based Fake News Detection

## Issue Overview

This issue requests a comprehensive analysis of experimental results from our heterogeneous graph neural network (HGN) approach for fake news detection. The analysis should cover both GossipCop and PolitiFact datasets, focusing on identifying optimal parameter combinations and providing insights for future research directions.

## Background

We have conducted extensive ablation studies using the `script/comprehensive_experiments.sh` script, which systematically explores different configurations of:

- **Few-shot learning scenarios**: 3-16 shot learning
- **Graph construction parameters**: Different k-neighbors (3, 5, 7), edge policies (knn, knn_test_isolated), multiview settings (0, 3, 6)
- **Feature engineering**: Dissimilar sampling, test labeled neighbor enforcement, partial unlabeled sampling
- **Model architecture**: HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network) as the primary GNN model
- **Embeddings**: DeBERTa-based text embeddings for news content

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Dataset-Specific Analysis Reports

**For each dataset (GossipCop and PolitiFact):**

- Generate `gossipcop_report.md` and `politifact_report.md` in the root directory
- Analyze all scenarios in `results_hetero/HAN/{dataset}/` folders
- Filter results to include only 3-16 shot experiments
- Extract and compare test F1-scores across different parameter combinations
- Use the existing `results/analyze_metrics.py --folder` utility to systematically extract metrics

**Required analysis components:**
- Performance comparison tables showing F1-scores for different configurations
- Identification of best-performing parameter combinations
- Analysis of the impact of different components (k-neighbors, edge policies, multiview, etc.)
- Statistical significance assessment where applicable

### 2. Comprehensive Pipeline Report

Generate `report.md` in the root directory containing:

**Technical Pipeline Analysis:**
- Review of `build_hetero_graph.py` implementation and its role in graph construction
- Analysis of `train_hetero_graph.py` training pipeline and optimization strategies
- Evaluation of the experimental design in `script/comprehensive_experiments.sh`

**Performance Insights:**
- Cross-dataset performance comparison
- Identification of dataset-specific optimal configurations
- Analysis of generalizability across different news domains

**Future Research Directions:**
- Potential improvements to the current pipeline
- Suggested parameter ranges for future exploration
- Recommendations for model architecture enhancements
- Areas where the current approach shows limitations

### 3. Visualization and Documentation

- Include performance comparison tables with clear formatting
- Provide statistical summaries of results
- Create plots/charts if beneficial for understanding trends
- Document methodology and assumptions clearly

## Technical Specifications

### Data Sources
- **Results location**: `results_hetero/HAN/gossipcop/` and `results_hetero/HAN/politifact/`
- **Metrics format**: JSON files containing test F1-scores in `final_test_metrics_on_target_node.f1_score`
- **Experiment range**: Focus on 3-16 shot learning scenarios only

### Analysis Tools
- Use existing `results/analyze_metrics.py` script for metric extraction
- Python-based analysis preferred for consistency with existing codebase
- Generate markdown reports for easy review and version control

### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of optimal parameter combinations for each dataset
- Quantitative assessment of different component contributions
- Clear recommendations for future research directions
- Well-documented methodology for reproducible analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Completeness**: All specified reports generated with comprehensive analysis
2. **Accuracy**: Correct extraction and interpretation of F1-scores from result files
3. **Clarity**: Reports are well-structured and easy to understand
4. **Actionability**: Clear recommendations provided for future improvements
5. **Documentation**: Methodology and assumptions clearly documented
6. **Reproducibility**: Analysis approach can be replicated by other researchers
