# GemGNN: Generative Multi-view Interaction Graph Neural Networks for Few-shot Fake News Detection

## Project Overview

This project implements a novel approach for few-shot fake news detection using **Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN)** with advanced regularization techniques and bootstrap validation. The system is designed to perform reliably with very limited labeled data (3-16 shot scenarios).

## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Heterogeneous Graph Architecture
- **Node Types**: 
  - `news`: Article nodes with text embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, etc.)
  - `interaction`: Social interaction nodes with tone/sentiment features
- **Edge Types**:
  - `news-similar_to-news`: Content similarity edges
  - `news-has_interaction-interaction`: News-interaction relationships
  - `news-dissimilar_to-news`: Content dissimilarity edges (optional)

### 2. Advanced Edge Construction Policies

#### **KNN with Test Isolation (`knn_test_isolated`)**
- **Training nodes**: Can connect to any other training node
- **Test nodes**: Only connect to training nodes (prevents data leakage)
- **Rationale**: Maintains realistic evaluation conditions while enabling transductive learning

#### **Label-Aware KNN (`label_aware_knn`)**
- Uses pseudo-labeling with confidence-based sampling
- Connects nodes based on both similarity and predicted label consistency
- Incorporates multi-level KNN (high-level label-aware + low-level general)

#### **Multi-View Graph Construction**
- Splits embeddings into multiple views (sub-embeddings)
- Creates separate similarity graphs for each view
- Enables capturing different semantic aspects of news content

### 3. Enhanced Regularization for Few-Shot Learning

#### **Label Smoothing (α=0.1)**
```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)
```
- Prevents overconfident predictions in few-shot scenarios
- Improves generalization by softening target distributions

#### **Hardcoded Overfitting Threshold (0.3)**
```python
OVERFIT_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # Stop if validation loss < 0.3
```
- Fair and practical across different datasets
- Prevents models from memorizing the small training set

#### **Increased Dropout (0.3)**
```python
DEFAULT_DROPOUT = 0.3  # Increased from 0.0
```
- Stronger regularization for few-shot scenarios
- Reduces overfitting to limited training data

#### **Loss-Based Model Selection**
- Uses validation loss instead of F1 for model selection
- More stable in few-shot scenarios where F1 can quickly hit 1.0

### 4. Bootstrap Validation Framework

#### **Rationale for Bootstrap in Few-Shot Learning**
- Traditional cross-validation unreliable with 8-16 total labeled samples
- Bootstrap provides proper uncertainty quantification
- Enables ensemble methods for improved robustness

#### **Enhanced Bootstrap Implementation**
```python
# Stratified bootstrap for few-shot stability
bootstrap_train_indices, val_indices = train_test_split(
    self.train_labeled_indices,
    test_size=min_val_samples,
    stratify=self.train_labeled_labels,
    random_state=np.random.randint(0, 10000)
)
```

#### **Ensemble Methods**
1. **Majority Voting**: Simple consensus across bootstrap models
2. **Probability Averaging**: Average softmax outputs for final prediction
3. **Weighted Ensemble**: Weight models by validation performance

## Technical Architecture

### Model Implementations

#### **HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network)**
- Meta-path based attention mechanism
- Captures heterogeneous relationships
- Lightweight and effective for few-shot scenarios

#### **HGT (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer)**
- Advanced transformer architecture for graphs
- Handles multiple node/edge types natively
- More complex but potentially more expressive

#### **HANv2 (Enhanced HAN)**
- Multiple layers with residual connections
- Layer normalization for training stability
- Balances complexity and performance

### Graph Construction Pipeline

```
1. Load Dataset → 2. Sample K-Shot → 3. Build News Nodes → 4. Add Interaction Nodes → 5. Construct Edges → 6. Apply Multi-View → 7. Save Graph
```

#### **Transductive Learning Strategy**
- **train_labeled_mask**: K-shot labeled samples for supervision
- **train_unlabeled_mask**: Unlabeled samples for message passing
- **test_mask**: Test samples (isolated from test data during edge construction)

### Key Design Decisions

#### **Why Heterogeneous Graphs?**
1. **Real-world Modeling**: News articles don't exist in isolation - they have social interactions
2. **Rich Feature Space**: Combines textual content with social signals
3. **Inductive Bias**: Graph structure provides useful prior for few-shot learning

#### **Why Bootstrap over Cross-Validation?**
1. **Sample Size**: 8-shot = 16 total samples across 2 classes
2. **Realistic Evaluation**: Bootstrap provides more honest performance estimates
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence intervals for statistical rigor
4. **Ensemble Benefits**: Multiple models reduce overfitting risk

#### **Why Advanced Regularization?**
1. **Overfitting Prevention**: Critical with limited training data
2. **Generalization**: Label smoothing improves robustness
3. **Stability**: Hardcoded thresholds provide consistent stopping criteria

## Performance Analysis

### Typical Results (8-shot PolitiFact)
- **Single Training**: F1 = 0.8382 (potentially overfitted)
- **Bootstrap Single**: F1 = 0.4171 (honest but pessimistic)
- **Bootstrap Ensemble**: F1 = 0.7732-0.8081 (robust and reliable)

### Academic Recommendations
1. **Primary Metric**: Bootstrap Weighted Ensemble F1
2. **Report**: Confidence intervals from bootstrap validation
3. **Baseline**: Compare against single training approach
4. **Significance**: Use bootstrap statistics for hypothesis testing

## Conclusion

This framework provides a robust, academically sound approach to few-shot fake news detection. The combination of heterogeneous graph neural networks, advanced regularization, and bootstrap validation offers both theoretical grounding and practical effectiveness. The methodology is particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce and reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial.

The bootstrap ensemble approach, while showing lower individual model performance, provides more honest and reliable estimates of true generalization capability - a critical consideration for deployment in high-stakes applications like misinformation detection.
