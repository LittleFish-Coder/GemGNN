# Simplified LESS4FD Requirements
# 
# No additional requirements needed beyond the main repository!
# 
# This simplified LESS4FD implementation is fully self-contained and uses
# only the dependencies already specified in the main repository's requirements.txt
#
# To install dependencies, run from the main repository root:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
