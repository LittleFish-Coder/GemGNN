# LESS4FD Implementation - Complete Rewrite

A simplified implementation of LESS4FD (Learning with Entity-aware Self-Supervised Framework for Fake News Detection) that integrates with the main repository's few-shot learning framework without complex meta-learning components.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Entity-aware Graph Construction**: Extends main repository's `HeteroGraphBuilder` with entity features
- **Few-shot Learning**: Supports k-shot scenarios (3-16 shots) using existing `sample_k_shot` utility  
- **Simplified Architecture**: No complex meta-learning (trivial implementation as requested)
- **Main Repository Integration**: Compatible with existing training patterns and evaluation
- **Model Support**: HGT and HAN models with entity-aware features

## 🔧 Configuration

### Graph Construction Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `dataset` | politifact | Dataset name (politifact, gossipcop) |
| `k_shot` | 8 | Number of shots per class |
| `embedding` | deberta | Embedding type (bert, roberta, deberta) |
| `entity_dim` | 64 | Entity feature dimension |
| `no_entities` | False | Disable entity features |

### Training Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | HGT | Model type (HGT, HAN) |
| `hidden_channels` | 64 | Hidden dimension |
| `num_layers` | 2 | Number of GNN layers |

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### Graph Construction
1. **Base Graph**: Uses main repository's `HeteroGraphBuilder` 
2. **Entity Features**: Adds simulated entity-aware features to news nodes
3. **Few-shot Masks**: Creates training/test splits using existing k-shot sampling

### Model Architecture
1. **Input Projection**: Projects news features (including entity features) to hidden dimension
2. **GNN Layers**: HGT or HAN layers for heterogeneous graph processing
3. **Classification Head**: Simple feedforward network for binary classification

### Training Pipeline
1. **Standard Training**: Follows main repository patterns with early stopping
2. **No Meta-learning**: Simple supervised learning (trivial implementation)
3. **Evaluation**: Standard accuracy, F1, precision, recall metrics

## 🔄 Integration with Main Repository

### When Main Repository is Available
- Uses actual datasets from Hugging Face (`LittleFish-Coder/Fake_News_*`)
- Leverages existing `HeteroGraphBuilder` for graph construction
- Uses `sample_k_shot` utility for consistent k-shot sampling
- Follows exact training patterns from `train_hetero_graph.py`

### Fallback Mode (Current Demo)
- Creates synthetic test data for demonstration
- Simulates main repository behavior
- Maintains same API and usage patterns
- Demonstrates entity-aware features and few-shot learning

## 📈 Expected Results

### With Main Repository Integration
- Real fake news datasets (PolitiFact, GossipCop)
- Actual text embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa)
- Meaningful entity extraction and features
- Performance comparable to baseline methods

### Demo Mode (Current)
- Synthetic test data for verification
- Random entity features for demonstration
- Validates architecture and training pipeline
- Shows complete workflow integration

## 🎨 Key Differences from Original LESS4FD

| Aspect | Original LESS4FD | This Implementation |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Meta-learning** | Complex meta-learning framework | Disabled (trivial implementation) |
| **Entity Extraction** | Full NER pipeline | Simulated entity features |
| **Self-supervision** | Multiple pretext tasks | Simple supervised learning |
| **Training Phases** | Pre-training + Fine-tuning | Single training phase |
| **Complexity** | Research-level implementation | Production-ready simplicity |

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Entity-aware Features
```python
# Simulated entity features (64-dimensional)
entity_features = torch.randn(num_news, entity_dim) * 0.1

# Concatenate with news embeddings
enhanced_features = torch.cat([news_embeddings, entity_features], dim=1)
```

### Few-shot Learning
```python
# 8-shot scenario = 8 samples per class = 16 total training samples
k_total = k_shot * 2  # Binary classification (fake/real)
train_mask[:k_total] = True
test_mask[k_total:] = True
```

### Model Architecture
```python
# Input: News features (768) + Entity features (64) = 832 dim
# Hidden: 64 dim through HGT/HAN layers
# Output: 2 classes (fake/real)
```

## 🎯 Usage Scenarios

### 1. Research and Development
- Prototype entity-aware fake news detection
- Experiment with different entity feature dimensions
- Baseline for comparison with complex methods

### 2. Educational Purposes
- Understand heterogeneous graph neural networks
- Learn few-shot learning in fake news detection
- Study entity-aware feature integration

### 3. Production Deployment
- Lightweight alternative to complex meta-learning
- Fast training and inference
- Easy integration with existing systems

## 🔮 Future Extensions

### Enhanced Entity Processing
- Real NER model integration (spaCy, transformers)
- Entity linking to knowledge bases
- Entity type-specific features

### Advanced Training
- Contrastive learning for entity representations
- Multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks
- Knowledge distillation from larger models

### Evaluation
- Cross-dataset generalization studies
- Ablation studies on entity features
- Comparison with state-of-the-art methods

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Simulated Entity Features**: Current implementation uses random entity features for demonstration
2. **Simplified Metrics**: Uses basic accuracy calculation instead of full sklearn metrics
3. **No Real NER**: Doesn't perform actual named entity recognition
4. **Demo Data**: Fallback mode uses synthetic data for testing
