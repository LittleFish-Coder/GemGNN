This thesis presents GemGNN (Generative Multi-view Interaction Graph Neural Networks), a novel framework for few-shot fake news detection that addresses fundamental limitations of existing approaches through content-based graph neural network modeling enhanced with generative auxiliary data and rigorous evaluation protocols.

\section{Summary of Contributions}

Our work establishes several key methodological and technical contributions that collectively advance the state-of-the-art in few-shot fake news detection and establish new paradigms for content-based misinformation detection:

\textbf{Heterogeneous Graph Framework for Fake News Detection:} We introduce the first systematic application of heterogeneous graph neural networks to few-shot fake news detection, creating a framework that models both content similarity and synthetic social interactions within a unified graph structure. This innovation represents a paradigm shift from homogeneous content-based graphs to rich heterogeneous structures that capture multiple facets of the misinformation ecosystem without requiring real user data.

\textbf{Generative User Interaction Simulation:} We develop the first approach to systematically synthesize realistic user interactions using Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing fake news detection. Our method leverages state-of-the-art LLMs to generate diverse user responses across multiple semantic tones (neutral, affirmative, skeptical), creating controllable synthetic social signals that enhance content-based detection while maintaining complete privacy protection. This contribution demonstrates how generative AI can augment rather than replace traditional machine learning approaches.

% Comment: This addresses the fundamental privacy vs. performance trade-off in current fake news detection systems

\textbf{Test-Isolated KNN Edge Construction:} We develop a novel graph construction methodology that prevents information leakage between test nodes through strict isolation constraints while preserving the benefits of transductive learning. Our approach ensures that test nodes can only connect to training nodes during graph construction, addressing a critical methodological flaw in existing graph-based few-shot learning methods that leads to unrealistic performance estimates. This contribution establishes new standards for rigorous evaluation in graph-based few-shot learning.

\textbf{Multi-View Graph Architecture:} We propose a multi-view learning framework that partitions news embeddings into multiple semantic perspectives, enabling the capture of diverse content aspects through parallel graph structures. Each view constructs its own similarity-based graph, and multiple graphs are trained simultaneously to provide comprehensive data augmentation at the graph level. This approach enhances representation learning by encouraging the model to discover multiple complementary semantic patterns within the same content.

\textbf{Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks:} We design a specialized Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) architecture optimized for few-shot fake news detection, incorporating type-specific attention mechanisms and hierarchical aggregation strategies. Our architecture effectively models complex relationships between news articles and generated user interactions while implementing transductive learning that maximizes the utility of unlabeled data in few-shot scenarios.

\textbf{Comprehensive Few-Shot Evaluation Framework:} We establish the most rigorous experimental evaluation framework to date for few-shot fake news detection, including systematic parameter grid searches across 2,688 different configurations, comprehensive ablation studies, and comparison with diverse baseline approaches ranging from traditional machine learning to large language models. Our evaluation protocols prevent common sources of bias and provide statistically robust performance assessments.

\textbf{Methodological Innovations:} Beyond individual technical components, our work introduces several important methodological innovations: (1) systematic integration of generative AI with specialized graph neural networks, (2) rigorous few-shot evaluation protocols that prevent information leakage while maintaining transductive benefits, (3) comprehensive analysis of heterogeneous graph architectures in data-scarce scenarios, and (4) novel approaches to synthetic data generation that complement rather than replace human-labeled training data.

\section{Key Findings and Insights}

Our comprehensive experimental evaluation reveals several important insights about few-shot fake news detection:

\textbf{Graph Structure Effectiveness:} Heterogeneous graph structures provide substantial benefits over independent document processing in few-shot scenarios. The ability to propagate information from limited labeled examples to unlabeled instances through graph connectivity is crucial for achieving strong performance with minimal supervision.

\textbf{Generative Data Augmentation Value:} LLM-generated user interactions provide meaningful signal for fake news detection, with different interaction tones (neutral, affirmative, skeptical) contributing complementary information. Skeptical interactions show particularly high discriminative power for identifying misinformation.

\textbf{Test Isolation Importance:} The test-isolated KNN strategy is critical for realistic evaluation, with removal of this constraint leading to the largest performance drop (-0.07 F1-score) among all ablated components. This finding highlights the importance of preventing information leakage in few-shot learning evaluation.

\textbf{Multi-View Benefits:} The multi-view approach captures diverse semantic perspectives that improve model robustness and generalization. By forcing the model to learn from multiple similarity views, we achieve more stable performance across different types of news content.

\textbf{Transductive Learning Advantages:} The transductive learning paradigm effectively leverages unlabeled data to improve feature representation in few-shot scenarios. Including all nodes in message passing while restricting loss computation to labeled nodes maximizes information utilization.

\section{Implications for Fake News Detection}

Our work has several important implications for the broader field of fake news detection:

\textbf{Privacy-Preserving Detection:} By eliminating dependency on user behavior data, our approach enables fake news detection in scenarios where privacy regulations or platform restrictions prevent access to social information. This capability is increasingly important as privacy concerns grow and data access becomes more restricted.

\textbf{Real-Time Deployment:} The content-based nature of our approach enables real-time fake news detection without waiting for propagation patterns to develop. This capability is crucial for identifying misinformation in its early stages before it can spread widely.

\textbf{Cross-Domain Generalization:} Our framework demonstrates consistent performance across different news domains (political vs. entertainment), suggesting that the learned representations capture general misinformation patterns rather than domain-specific artifacts.

\textbf{Few-Shot Practicality:} The strong performance in few-shot scenarios makes our approach practical for detecting misinformation about emerging topics or novel events where extensive labeled data is not available.

\textbf{Synthetic Data Integration:} Our successful integration of LLM-generated auxiliary data opens new directions for incorporating synthetic information to enhance detection systems while maintaining evaluation integrity.

\section{Limitations and Challenges}

Despite the significant advances presented in this work, several limitations and challenges remain:

\textbf{Embedding Dependency:} Our approach's performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the underlying DeBERTa embeddings. While these representations capture rich semantic information, they may miss subtle linguistic patterns or domain-specific indicators that human fact-checkers would recognize.

\textbf{Sophisticated Misinformation:} Highly sophisticated fake news that closely mimics legitimate journalism style can still challenge our approach, particularly when the content contains accurate peripheral information with subtle factual distortions that are difficult to detect through content analysis alone.

\textbf{LLM Generation Costs:} While the one-time cost of generating user interactions can be amortized across multiple experiments, the computational expense of LLM inference may limit scalability to very large datasets or frequent retraining scenarios.

\textbf{Static Graph Limitation:} Our current approach constructs static graphs based on pre-computed embeddings, which may not capture dynamic relationships that evolve as new information becomes available or as the understanding of news events develops.

\textbf{Evaluation Dataset Size:} The relatively small size of available fake news datasets limits our ability to conduct more extensive few-shot experiments with larger support sets or more diverse evaluation scenarios.

\textbf{Interpretability Challenges:} While our approach provides some interpretability through attention mechanisms, understanding exactly how the model makes decisions remains challenging, particularly for the complex interactions between multiple graph views and heterogeneous node types.

\section{Future Research Directions}
