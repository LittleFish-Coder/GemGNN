This thesis presents GemGNN (Generative Multi-view Interaction Graph Neural Networks), a novel framework for few-shot fake news detection that addresses fundamental limitations of existing approaches through content-based graph neural network modeling enhanced with generative auxiliary data and rigorous evaluation protocols.

\section{Summary of Contributions}

Our work establishes several key methodological and technical contributions that collectively advance the state-of-the-art in few-shot fake news detection and establish new paradigms for content-based misinformation detection:

\textbf{Heterogeneous Graph Framework Innovation:} We introduce the first systematic application of heterogeneous graph neural networks to few-shot fake news detection, creating a unified framework that models both content similarity and synthetic social interactions. This represents a paradigm shift from homogeneous content-based graphs to rich heterogeneous structures that capture multiple facets of the misinformation ecosystem without requiring real user data.

\textbf{Generative User Interaction Simulation:} We develop a novel approach to systematically synthesize realistic user interactions using Large Language Models, creating controllable synthetic social signals that enhance content-based detection while maintaining complete privacy protection. Our method generates diverse user responses across multiple semantic tones (neutral, affirmative, skeptical) that capture different user perspectives and emotional responses to news content.

\textbf{Test-Isolated Evaluation Methodology:} We establish rigorous evaluation protocols that prevent information leakage while maintaining transductive learning benefits. Our test-isolated KNN approach ensures that evaluation reflects realistic constraints where new articles cannot reference each other, providing authentic performance assessment for few-shot scenarios.

\textbf{Multi-View DeBERTa Architecture:} We leverage DeBERTa's disentangled attention mechanism to create embeddings with superior partitioning properties, enabling meaningful multi-view learning where each view captures distinct linguistic and semantic aspects while maintaining discriminative power. This architectural choice fundamentally enables our multi-view approach to achieve robust performance.

\textbf{Cross-Entropy Loss Optimization:} Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that cross-entropy loss with label smoothing provides optimal performance for few-shot fake news detection. This finding highlights that effective few-shot learning can be achieved through architectural innovations rather than complex loss engineering, with simple yet well-regularized objectives proving most effective when combined with sophisticated graph structures.

\textbf{Comprehensive Component Validation:} We provide detailed ablation studies demonstrating the individual contribution of each architectural component, revealing that heterogeneous graph structure (-0.09 impact), test isolation (-0.07), synthetic interactions (-0.05), and multi-view learning (-0.03) all contribute meaningfully to overall performance.

\section{Key Findings and Research Insights}

Our comprehensive experimental evaluation reveals several important insights about few-shot fake news detection and the mechanisms underlying effective content-based misinformation identification:

\textbf{Heterogeneous Graph Architecture Superiority:} Heterogeneous graph structures provide substantial benefits over independent document processing in few-shot scenarios. The ability to model different node types (news articles vs. synthetic interactions) and edge types (content similarity vs. tone-specific interactions) enables specialized attention mechanisms that capture complementary information sources unavailable to homogeneous approaches.

\textbf{Synthetic Interaction Effectiveness:} LLM-generated user interactions provide meaningful signal for fake news detection, with different interaction tones contributing complementary information. Skeptical interactions demonstrate the highest discriminative power (-0.08 when removed), while the combination of all three tones (neutral, affirmative, skeptical) achieves optimal performance through comprehensive perspective coverage.

\textbf{Multi-View Learning Benefits:} DeBERTa embedding partitioning captures diverse semantic perspectives that improve model robustness and generalization. Our analysis reveals that each view focuses on distinct linguistic aspects: lexical semantics (View 1), syntactic patterns (View 2), and stylistic elements (View 3). The learned attention mechanism successfully combines these complementary perspectives for enhanced detection capability.

\textbf{Evaluation Methodology Impact:} The comparison between traditional KNN (4.0% higher performance) and test-isolated KNN (methodologically sound) reveals a fundamental trade-off in graph-based few-shot learning evaluation. Our test-isolated approach provides conservative but realistic performance estimates that better reflect actual deployment scenarios where new articles cannot reference each other.

\textbf{Transductive Learning Advantages:} The transductive paradigm effectively leverages unlabeled data to improve feature representation in few-shot scenarios. Including all nodes in message passing while restricting loss computation to labeled nodes maximizes information utilization, particularly beneficial when labeled examples are severely limited (K=3-4 shots).

\textbf{Cross-Domain Generalization:} Consistent relative performance improvements across different news domains (political vs. entertainment) and class distributions (2:1 vs. 4:1 real-to-fake ratios) demonstrate that our approach captures domain-invariant misinformation patterns rather than dataset-specific artifacts.

\section{Implications for Misinformation Detection Research}

Our work has several important implications for the broader field of misinformation detection and content authenticity verification:

\textbf{Privacy-Preserving Detection Paradigm:} By eliminating dependency on user behavior data and social propagation patterns, our approach enables effective fake news detection under strict privacy constraints. This capability addresses growing concerns about user privacy and data access restrictions while maintaining high detection accuracy.

\textbf{Early-Stage Misinformation Identification:} The content-based nature of our approach enables detection of misinformation before it spreads widely through social networks. This early identification capability is crucial for preventing viral spread of false information and reducing societal impact.

\textbf{Few-Shot Learning Applicability:} Strong performance in extremely few-shot scenarios (K=3-4) makes our approach practical for detecting misinformation about emerging topics, novel events, or rapidly evolving news stories where extensive labeled data is unavailable.

\textbf{Synthetic Data Integration Framework:} Our successful integration of LLM-generated auxiliary data establishes a paradigm for incorporating synthetic information to enhance detection systems while maintaining evaluation integrity and avoiding overfitting to generated content.

\textbf{Methodological Rigor in Graph-Based Learning:} Our test-isolated evaluation protocol addresses a fundamental methodological issue in graph-based few-shot learning, providing guidance for authentic performance assessment that better reflects real-world constraints.

\section{Limitations and Challenges}

Despite the significant advances presented in this work, several limitations and challenges remain:

\textbf{Embedding Dependency:} Our approach's performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the underlying DeBERTa embeddings. While these representations capture rich semantic information, they may miss subtle linguistic patterns or domain-specific indicators that human fact-checkers would recognize.

\textbf{Sophisticated Misinformation:} Highly sophisticated fake news that closely mimics legitimate journalism style can still challenge our approach, particularly when the content contains accurate peripheral information with subtle factual distortions that are difficult to detect through content analysis alone.

\textbf{LLM Generation Costs:} While the one-time cost of generating user interactions can be amortized across multiple experiments, the computational expense of LLM inference may limit scalability to very large datasets or frequent retraining scenarios.

\textbf{Static Graph Limitation:} Our current approach constructs static graphs based on pre-computed embeddings, which may not capture dynamic relationships that evolve as new information becomes available or as the understanding of news events develops.

\textbf{Evaluation Dataset Size:} The relatively small size of available fake news datasets limits our ability to conduct more extensive few-shot experiments with larger support sets or more diverse evaluation scenarios.

\textbf{Interpretability Challenges:} While our approach provides some interpretability through attention mechanisms, understanding exactly how the model makes decisions remains challenging, particularly for the complex interactions between multiple graph views and heterogeneous node types.

\section{Future Research Directions}

Our work opens several promising avenues for future research that could further advance few-shot fake news detection and establish new paradigms for misinformation detection:

\subsection{Advanced Graph Architecture Research}

\textbf{Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs:} Developing temporal graph construction methods that can model the evolution of news stories and user reactions over time. This includes investigating online learning algorithms that update graph structure as new information becomes available and temporal attention mechanisms that weight recent interactions more heavily while preserving historical context patterns.

\textbf{Hierarchical Multi-Scale Graphs:} Extending heterogeneous graph structures to include additional semantic levels such as topic hierarchies, entity relationships, and factual claim networks. This multi-scale approach could capture more comprehensive representations of the misinformation ecosystem while maintaining computational efficiency through hierarchical attention mechanisms.

\textbf{Adaptive Edge Construction:} Investigating learned edge construction strategies that can automatically adapt connectivity patterns based on content type, domain characteristics, or temporal context. This includes exploring reinforcement learning approaches for optimizing graph topology and neural architecture search methods for discovering effective connectivity patterns.

\textbf{Cross-Modal Graph Integration:} Extending the framework to incorporate multi-modal information including images, videos, and metadata within the heterogeneous graph structure. This could involve developing specialized attention mechanisms for different modalities and investigating how visual-textual consistency patterns contribute to misinformation detection.

\subsection{Enhanced Few-Shot Learning Methodologies}

\textbf{Meta-Learning for Heterogeneous Graphs:} Exploring meta-learning approaches specifically designed for heterogeneous graph structures, including model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) variants that can quickly adapt to new misinformation domains with minimal examples. This research direction could enable rapid adaptation to emerging misinformation tactics and novel content domains.

\textbf{Active Learning with Graph Structure:} Developing active learning strategies that consider graph connectivity when selecting examples for labeling, potentially improving few-shot performance by intelligently choosing support set examples that maximize information propagation. This includes investigating uncertainty-aware selection criteria and diversity-based sampling strategies.

\textbf{Continual Learning Capabilities:} Implementing continual learning mechanisms that can adapt to emerging misinformation patterns without catastrophic forgetting of previously learned detection capabilities. This addresses the challenge of rapidly evolving misinformation tactics and the need for systems that remain effective over time.

\textbf{Transfer Learning Across Domains:} Investigating how models trained on one domain (e.g., political news) can transfer to other domains (e.g., health misinformation) with minimal additional supervision. This includes developing domain adaptation techniques specifically designed for heterogeneous graph structures.

\subsection{Advanced Generative Enhancement}

\textbf{Sophisticated Interaction Generation:} Advancing beyond simple tone-based generation to create more nuanced synthetic interactions that consider user persona modeling, temporal dynamics, and contextual conversation threads. This could involve developing specialized language models trained on social media interaction patterns or implementing persona-consistent generation strategies.

\textbf{Multi-Modal Interaction Synthesis:} Investigating the generation of multi-modal synthetic interactions that include not only textual responses but also visual reactions, sharing patterns, and engagement metrics. This could provide richer synthetic social signals while maintaining privacy protection.

\textbf{Adversarial Interaction Generation:} Developing adversarial generation strategies that create challenging synthetic interactions to improve model robustness. This includes generating interactions that might fool current detection systems and using them for adversarial training.

\subsection{Robustness and Security Research}

\textbf{Adversarial Robustness:} Enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks specifically designed to fool graph-based detection systems, including graph structure attacks, node feature perturbations, and coordinated manipulation attempts. This research should investigate both defensive mechanisms and evaluation protocols for adversarial scenarios.

\textbf{AI-Generated Content Detection:} Developing specialized detection capabilities for AI-generated fake news, which may require different modeling approaches than human-created misinformation. This includes investigating how AI-generated content interacts with our LLM-generated interaction simulation component and developing countermeasures.
