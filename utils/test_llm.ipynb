    "# LLM Training Data Contamination Check\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To investigate whether specific examples from the test set of a dataset (e.g., PolitiFact, GossipCop) might have been included in the training data of a given Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1. Load the target dataset and select a few examples from the **test split**.\n",
    "2. Load the LLM to be tested.\n",
    "3. Query the LLM about these specific examples using:\n",
    "    *   **Direct Questioning:** Ask if the model has seen the exact text before.\n",
    "    *   **Completion Task:** Provide a prefix of the text and ask the model to complete it.\n",
    "4. Analyze the responses. Verbatim completions or overly specific acknowledgments *might* suggest prior exposure, but are not definitive proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** This method provides indicative evidence, not absolute proof. LLMs might generate text that coincidentally matches or claim knowledge they don't possess."

It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't \"real\" reform and thus isn't worth doing.

Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal.\n",
