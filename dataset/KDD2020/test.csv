"How great it would be to be able to go out on a date with a favorite superheroe. Probably for some of us our partners are our personal superheroes, but we know that deep down we dream of the God of thunder, beautiful spies stealing classified information, night watchmen, or women with pyrotechnic skills. At some point, everyone has wished to have a date with one of those characters or at least with one of the actors that played them.  But for some people, this dream has come true. Deep in their hearts everyone else envies them because they know it must be fun to be able to say that their husband, wife or even one of their parents has been defeating different villains under the spotlights of the Hollywood cameras. So, let's stop and think about it for a moment... if being a parent is already a challenge then try to picture being parents and superheroes at the same time. Anyone else would lose their minds! But Commissioner James Gordon once said ""[One has] to make a difference. A lot of time it won't be huge. It won't be visible even. But it will matter just the same"".  That's why today we will talk about those actors who have brought the world's favorite superheroes to life and have had to learn to balance their lives as parents and superheroes in the film industry.  20 Gal Gadot Is The Perfect Wonder Woman  Gal Gadot is an Israeli actress and model, who is best known for her role in films such as Fast and Furious, and for playing the role of Wonder Woman in the film adaptation of DC comics, participating in films such as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Wonder Woman (2017) and Justice League (2017).

"Kim Kardashian West took to Twitter to shut down rumors that began swirling after a Snapchat video she posted last night started to cause some controversy. In the bottom right hand corner of the video, two short, thin, straight white lines can be seen on a table behind the reality star. It didn't take long for many of her millions of followers to screenshot the scene and upload it to social media, pointing out that the two white lines look suspiciously like cocaine.  “I do not play with rumours like this,” she wrote in response. “That’s sugar from our candy mess from dylan’s candy shop.”  I do not play with rumors like this so I'm gonna shut it down real quick. That's sugar from our candy mess from dylan's candy shop https://t.co/oICdPQVi8d — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 11, 2017  Image via Snapchat  For the record, Kim is indeed in NYC this week, and according to photos posted on TMZ she did take her daughter North to Dylan’s Candy Shop in Manhattan this Sunday.  This isn’t the first time a Kardashian has been involved in a social media related cocaine scandal.

"At the beginning of the 2018 VMAs Monday night, Cardi B unwrapped what many thought was a blanket carrying her daughter, Kulture. Instead, it was the symbol of the Video Music Awards: the Moon Person.  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Moon Person might be a new term to people who have watched the VMAs for years, and that's because for many years it used to be the Moonman. The trophy got a gender-neutral makeover before last year's awards ceremony.  “Why should it be a man?” Chris McCarthy, president of MTV, told the New York Times in 2017. “It could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.” The decision also came around the same time the MTV Movie and TV awards stopped separating their acting categories by gender.  The Moonman trophy has been around since the start of the VMAs. When the network started in 1981, it launched with footage of Apollo 11 blasting off into space, and an astronaut planting a flag with the MTV logo on the moon's surface. “Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll,"" a voiceover noted, and the rest was history. That footage played every hour on MTV for the first five years of the network's history.  MTV's new gender neutrality reflects the music industry's push for LGBTQ representation and gender equality. And that was already seen in the early awards handed out Monday night. The winner for Push Artist of the Year, Hayley Kiyoko, shouted out women like her looking to make it in music. ""This validates any queer woman of color that you can follow your dream,"" she said in her acceptance speech."	0

Leatham, who split from ex husband Colton Haynes in May, is notably also responsible for the over-the-top holiday decor at Kylie’s mom Kris’s mansion and the glam seasonal installations at Four Seasons hotels around the world.  This year’s sparkly model at Kylie’s Hidden Hills home replaces last year’s slightly more realistic one, which she called “20 feet of magic” (the gold version appears to be the same size) and featured a faux-snow covering known as flocking.  The treatment turns up on another of Kylie’s forest of trees for 2018: “I have a neon pink flocked in my bedroom. I literally have trees everywhere this year,” she says in a video documenting a particularly girly one on her Instagram Stories.  This Christmas will no doubt be extra special for Kylie and boyfriend Travis Scott as they celebrate with their 10-month-old daughter Stormi for the first time.

That year, she also displayed a massive gingerbread house customized with her name, as well as those of her then-boyfriend, Tyga and his son, King. Her beloved dogs, Bambi, Norman, Ernesto and Penny, were even immortalized in icing.	0

Though the couple has strived to keep their relationship private, it’s been broached on the current season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  “This is the first time I’ve ever been with anybody other than Kourtney [Kardashian], so it’s definitely different, but it’s been a really good thing for me,” Disick said on the Aug. 5 episode. “It’s a little bit different for me to talk about what’s going on now. Sometimes I feel guilty that I’ve moved on.”  “One part of me is really happy that I’m able to care about somebody again, but there always is some feeling in the back of me that feels guilty because I’m moving on from Kourtney,” he added.  Nevertheless, Disick said he was doing “amazing, for like, the first time in my life.”  “I think that Kourtney and I have been through a lot. It’s an ongoing struggle, but I think she’s doing well now and I’m happy for her,” he said. “I feel that I’m able to now live my life the way I should.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kourtney Kardashian ‘Trusts’ Sofia Richie with Her and Scott Disick’s Kids: Source  And while tensions will rise on this Sunday’s episode after Kardashian, 39, finds out Disick introduced Richie to their kids, sources have told PEOPLE that though the relationship raised eyebrows at first, as long as it helps keep the father of three on track, they have Kardashian’s blessing.  “Sofia is helping Scott be a better, healthier person,” said one source. “Kourtney feels confident that Scott and Sofia take good care of the kids. Scott is a great dad when he has his life together.”  “It helps that Kourtney now trusts Sofia,” added a second source. “The kids are allowed to spend time with her. Sofia likes having them and helps Scott. So far, the kids are giving Kourtney good reports about Sofia.”  “Sofia has shown over and over again that she is willing to stay with Scott even when things are not great — but Scott is doing well lately,” added the insider.

When Jennifer Aniston opens the door to the Malibu bungalow she’s been holed up in lately, she gives me a radiant smile and an effusive hello. Then she bursts into tears. We have scarcely sat down in the living room, a serene little haven simply furnished with cushy white sofas and white flowers and white candles, when her face crumples. She is instantly aghast. “I haven’t been feeling emotional lately, really I haven’t,” she wails, fluttering her hands like Rachel Green in distress, except that this time it isn’t funny. Other than the 24-hour security detail guarding her safety, Aniston is all alone in the modest rental where she has camped out while dealing with the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt—and its devastating aftermath, which has been far worse than the actual split. The last few months have brought an endless nightmare of hurtful headlines about her soon-to-be-ex-husband, along with blatantly fraudulent stories about herself, in the tabloids and supermarket gossip magazines. Pursued around the clock by the rabid paparazzi she refers to as “ratzies,” she is ambushed even on her own deck by photographers who lurk on the beach outside her door, spying on her every move. As she squeezes her eyes shut in an effort to stop crying, the scene provides a painful contrast with the last time we met. Little more than a year ago, I interviewed Pitt at the Beverly Hills mansion that he and Aniston had just spent two years renovating. A testament to both his passion for architecture and the couple’s hopeful vision of their shared future, the beautiful old house awaited only a baby in a bassinet to complete a picture-perfect existence. When I left, they both walked me out to my car. Their home, its windows lit and welcoming, glowed in the twilight. As we said our good-byes, Pitt and Aniston leaned together in the driveway, arms twined around each other. Her head rested trustingly on his buff chest, still pumped up from his rigorous training to play the warrior Achilles in Troy. They seemed the most fortunate couple imaginable—two beautiful superstars who had hit the jackpot, earning not only fame and riches but also an enduring love. Their fans had long been captivated by the romance of America’s Sweetheart and the Sexiest Man in the World, and now they were ready to begin a thrilling new chapter. Aniston’s 10-year run on Friends was ending, and she and Pitt had vowed to start a family when her stupendously successful television series was finished. Pitt’s final words to me reinforced the impression of connubial bliss: “I’m happier than I’ve ever been.” But the ensuing months brought an onslaught of rumors that he had gotten involved with Angelina Jolie while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Instead of the joyful announcement many had anticipated from the Pitts, there was only silence. The New Year began with photographs of the beautiful couple strolling hand in hand along the beach on Anguilla, looking relaxed and happy. Immediately the buzz shifted into rhapsodic re-appraisals of the state of their union. And then came the oh-so-civilized announcement, on January 7, that Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt were separating—that their parting was “the result of much thoughtful consideration,” that it was not caused by “any of the speculation reported by the tabloid media,” and that they would remain “committed and caring friends with great love and admiration for one another.” If Pitt had kept a low profile in the months to come, that might even have turned out to be true. Instead, the ominous drumroll of gossip began to crescendo as he and Jolie rendezvoused in exotic locales, still denying that they were an item. With the paparazzi snapping away, Pitt stepped into what looked suspiciously like a paternal role with Jolie’s adopted Cambodian son, Maddox. “It was extremely hurtful to Jen that he was seen with another woman so quickly after they were separated,” says Andrea Bendewald, an actress who has been one of Aniston’s closest friends since they were teenagers. Instead of being reviled as The Other Woman, Jolie posed for pictures on an energetic round of appearances as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations—and then trumped even that public-relations bonanza by adopting another orphan, an African girl whose parents had died of AIDS. In the blink of an eye, the twice-divorced Jolie—previously known as a tattooed vixen with a taste for bisexuality, heroin, brotherly incest, mental institutions, and wearing her husbands’ blood—had morphed into a globe-trotting humanitarian who seemed to be channeling Audrey Hepburn. For the 36-year-old Aniston, who had expected to spend the past year being pregnant, the pain of watching this spectacle unfold was compounded by vicious rumors about herself. As misogynist as they were false, sensationalistic stories claimed the real reason the marriage ended was that Aniston refused to have Pitt’s baby because she was so ambitious she cared only about her career. Even now, that sexist slur makes her face darken. “A man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children,” she says. “That really pissed me off. I’ve never in my life said I didn’t want to have children. I did and I do and I will! The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I’ve always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career. I want to have it all.” Aniston’s intimates note acidly that Pitt could have done more to refute the mean-spirited rumor that his wife wouldn’t bear his child, which reinforced the impression that he had good cause to leave her for Earth Mother Jolie. To some, this looks like sheer hypocrisy. “When Brad and Jen were in the marriage, having a baby was not his priority—ever,” says one mutual friend. “It was an abstract desire for him, whereas for Jen it was much more immediate. So is there a part of Brad that’s diabolical? Did he think, I need to get out of this marriage, but I want to come out smelling like a rose, so I’m going to let Jen be cast as the ultra-feminist and I’m going to get cast as the poor husband who couldn’t get a baby and so had to move on?” As the image wars raged in the gossip media, a heartbroken Aniston retreated to her Malibu hideaway to lick her wounds in private, accompanied only by her elderly corgi-terrier mix, Norman, who spends most of his time snoring on his dog bed. Public sympathy seemed to be on her side; the Hollywood boutique Kitson reported that its “Team Aniston” T-shirts were outselling “Team Jolie” T-shirts by a margin of 25 to 1. But that was cold comfort as Aniston was assaulted by one provocation after another. When the Pitts split up, Brad insisted he hadn’t slept with Jolie, and Aniston accepted his denial. “She wasn’t naïve,” says Kristin Hahn, an executive at the Pitts’ production company, Plan B. “She’s not suggesting she didn’t know there was an enchantment, and a friendship. But Brad was saying, ‘This is not about another woman.’” The moment he and Aniston separated, however, he re-emerged in what looked like a full-blown affair with Jolie. Struggling to accept a separation she never wanted, Aniston found that the “facts” she had been told kept shifting like quicksand beneath her feet. When I ask about that gracious, no-one-is-to-blame announcement of their separation, she takes a deep breath. “What we said was true—” As I raise my eyebrows, she pauses for a moment, and then adds carefully, “—as far as I knew. We wrote it together, very consciously, and felt very good about it. We exited this relationship as beautifully as we entered it.” All Aniston wanted then was to figure out what happened; how did the happy life they’d planned drift so far off course? But everything changed on April 29, when photographs broke of Brad and Angelina frolicking on the beach with Maddox at a romantic resort in Africa. “The world was shocked, and I was shocked,” she says, still bending over backward not to excoriate her ex. But to say that this news was like pouring salt in the wound would understate its impact considerably; how about pouring molten lava into the hole where somebody ripped your heart out? And then things got worse.  The skies over Los Angeles are uncharacteristically gray today, and the Pacific shimmers with an opalescent sheen. Although the weather is gloomy, the ocean is calm; waves lap gently at the shoreline, making a soft shushing sound that Aniston has found very soothing lately. “That’s quite a backyard, in my opinion,” she says as we stand on her deck, watching the hypnotic rhythm of the waves. “Just being able to go to the water’s edge and scream—” Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. She grins. “Not too loudly. You don’t want people to think that you’re crazy. But it can be very cathartic.” She is wearing a white tank top and white drawstring linen pants, with a vivid lavender cashmere cardiwrap around her to ward off the unseasonable chill. Formidably toned by yoga, her body is in superb shape, but despite her tanned skin and megawatt smile she looks fragile and wan. She remains resolutely upbeat nonetheless, casting her current situation in the most positive light possible. “It’s beautiful here; I love it,” she says. “I’ve always wanted to have a little Malibu beach house, and it feels good. I’m enjoying simplifying things.” Although the bungalow was dark and depressing when she first saw it, a quickie makeover has transformed it into a cozy sanctuary that’s far more representative of Aniston’s personal taste than the showplace she and Pitt shared, where the décor seemed all hard edges and unforgiving materials. “Brad and I used to joke that every piece of furniture was either a museum piece or just uncomfortable,” Aniston says. “He definitely had his sense of style, and I definitely have my sense of style, and sometimes they clashed. I wasn’t so much into modern.” I mention Nicole Kidman’s quip after splitting up with Tom Cruise, when she was asked what she looked forward to in her new life without the diminutive husband who had abruptly ended their marriage. “Wearing high heels again,” Kidman retorted. So I ask Aniston—who filed for divorce on March 25 and expects it to become final this fall—what she’s enjoying about being on her own. “I can have a comfortable couch,” she says with a wry smile.  In the tabloids and celebrity gossip magazines, the soap-opera version of her life continues to hurtle along like a runaway express train, rushing Aniston through major life stages with ludicrous speed: Jen Is Devastated! Jen Is Furious! Jen Gets Revenge! Jen Has a New Man! Jen Is Over Brad! Most of the stories are wrong. (No, Oprah didn’t try to get Brad and Jen back together; no, Jen is not romantically involved with Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break-Up, a comedy about a separating couple who continue to live together, which they shot in Chicago over the summer.) Other reports are just idiotically simpleminded, breathlessly advancing a plot that bears little resemblance to the long, complex, painful experience of getting over a divorce. While the tabloids insist on dividing Aniston’s emotions into neat, distinct chapters, the reality is that pain and denial and anger and resignation all blur together, sometimes at the same moment—and the lengthy process of mourning is nowhere near over. “There are many stages of grief,” she says. “It’s sad, something coming to an end. It cracks you open, in a way—cracks you open to feeling. When you try to avoid the pain, it creates greater pain. I’m a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren’t in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it.” Aniston is struggling to find a deeper meaning in the debacle. “I have to think there’s some reason I have called this into my life,” she says. “I have to believe that—otherwise it’s just cruel.” Her friends are filled with admiration for the way she’s handled the whole mess. “This woman is basically having a root canal without anesthesia, but she’s really trying not to numb the pain or shove it under the rug,” says Hahn. “She’s grown so much, and she continues to grow on a daily basis, because every time you think, ‘Well, I’ve dealt with this,’ there’s another hurdle to get over. It’s a bit Job-like at the moment.” Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue.  Aniston’s response has been to retreat into her cocoon, “in an effort to take care of myself and my heart,” she says. “I feel like I’m nesting. I love being home. I have friends that come over. My girlfriends I’ve had for 20 years. When things happen, the tribe gathers around and lifts you up. I’ve had lonely moments, sure, but I’m also enjoying being alone. There’s no question it takes getting used to; I’m a partnership person, and if something happens your instinct is to share it—but you’re no longer part of a couple. I definitely miss that. It’s sort of like Bambi—like you’re trying to learn how to walk. You’re a little awkward; you stumble a little bit. The things you would do with your partner, you don’t do. It’s uncharted territory, but I think it’s good for me to be a solo person right now. You’re forced to re-discover yourself and take it to another level. If you can find a way to see the glass half full, these are the moments when you learn the most. I’ve had to re-introduce myself to myself in a way that’s different.” She doesn’t downplay the difficulties. “Am I lonely? Yes. Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I’ve thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I’m also doing really well,” she says. “I’ve got an unbelievable support team, and I’m a tough cookie.… I believe in therapy; I think it’s an incredible tool in educating the self on the self. I feel very strong. I’m really proud of how I’ve conducted myself.” A crucial part of Aniston’s strategy has been to ignore the putrid stew of rumor, speculation, and outright falsehood in the tabloid media. “It’s been very important for me not to read anything, not to see anything,” she says. “It’s been my saving grace. That stuff is just toxic for me right now. I probably avoided a lot of suffering by not engaging in it, not reading, not watching.” She gestures toward Norman, who has roused himself for a moment to check on his mistress’s whereabouts. “It’s like those dog cones,” she says, encircling her neck as if putting on one of the plastic cones prescribed by vets to prevent dogs from scratching their ears. “I have my imaginary dog cone on, so I don’t see anything. It just allows for a much more peaceful life.”  Nevertheless, as Pitt publicly flaunted the instant family he had created with Jolie, the tableaux of their newfound togetherness were humiliating. “I would be a robot if I said I didn’t feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,” Aniston acknowledges. But she tries to keep the lurid details to herself. “She is grieving, but she’s taken the high road,” says Bendewald. “She’s mourning the death of a marriage, and she’s done it very privately. She can have her moments of rage, but she doesn’t want to out him, and that keeps her heart clear. She’s not bad-mouthing him. She doesn’t want to make him the villain and her the victim.” Indeed, Aniston vehemently rejects the interpretation that she was left for another woman. “I don’t feel like a victim,” she says. “I’ve worked with this therapist for a long time, and her major focus is that you get one day of being a victim—and that’s it. Then we take responsibility for our own input. To live in a victim place is pointing a finger at someone else, as if you have no control. Relationships are two people; everyone is accountable. A lot goes into a relationship coming together, and a lot goes into a relationship falling apart. She’d say, ‘Even if it’s 98 percent the other person’s fault, it’s 2 percent yours, and that’s what we’re going to focus on.’ You can only clean up your side of the street.” These days, one index of recovery is the fact that Aniston’s sardonic humor is resurfacing. When I tell her that my 13-year-old son is a big fan of hers, she doesn’t miss a beat. “Is he single?” she asks, deadpan. She’ll toss off a crack about Pitt’s startling transformation into a punky bleached blond. “Billy Idol called—he wants his look back,” she murmurs with a sly smile. By now she can even talk about those gut-wrenching photos of Jolie and Pitt in Kenya with mordant resignation rather than tears. “I can’t say it was one of the highlights of my year,” she says. “Who would deal with that and say, ‘Isn’t that sweet! That looks like fun!’? But shit happens. You joke and say, ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’” She sighs. “I feel like I’ve earned a superpower shield,” she says. Then, afraid of sounding grandiose, she adds, “I’m not comparing my suffering to other people’s suffering. Everybody has their own.”  Aniston’s friends were particularly horrified by W magazine’s 60-page photo spread featuring Pitt and Jolie as an early-1960s-style married couple with a brood of miniature blond Brads. “You want to shake the shit out of him and say, ‘Your timing sucks!’” says one. “He’s made some choices that have been tremendously insensitive.” The W feature, which was entitled “Domestic Bliss,” couldn’t be blamed on the paparazzi; not only did Pitt conceptualize it, but he retained the international rights, so he actually profited from it. Aniston’s eyes widen in surprise when I mention that last fact, and she grimaces. “I didn’t know that,” she says. But she refuses to indulge herself in an angry reaction. “Is it odd timing? Yeah. But it’s not my life,” she says. “He makes his choices. He can do—whatever. We’re divorced, and you can see why.” She shakes her head in exasperation. “I can also imagine Brad having absolutely no clue why people would be appalled by it,” she adds. “Brad is not mean-spirited; he would never intentionally try to rub something in my face. In hindsight, I can see him going, ‘Oh—I can see that that was inconsiderate.’ But I know Brad. Brad would say, ‘That’s art!’” She rolls her eyes, pretending to screw something into her forehead. “There’s a sensitivity chip that’s missing,” she says. Aniston’s friends are amazed at her willingness to give Pitt the benefit of the doubt, but they basically agree with her assessment. “I don’t think he was trying to hurt Jen,” says Courteney Cox, Aniston’s dear friend and former co-star on Friends. “I don’t think that Brad is malicious, or a liar. The W thing was his idea, but I don’t think he thought that one through, about what it would look like to anyone else.” Although Aniston remains determined not to lash out, she sometimes questions her own restraint. “Why am I protecting him?” she exclaimed to one friend, only to continue with what she sees as the dignified course of action. “I’m not interested in taking public potshots,” she explains. “It’s not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation—it’s his life now. I’ve made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven’t retaliated. I don’t want to be a part of it. I don’t have a halo that I’m polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on. I am not defined by this relationship. I am not defined by the part they’re making me play in the triangle. It’s maddening to me. But I had a mom who was very angry about her divorce, and made shots, and I don’t want to play that out. If people are frustrated that I don’t want to do that, I’m sorry. I’m figuring this out as I go along. This is my first time at this particular picnic.”  As befits a storybook tale, the Pitts’ marriage was the first for both of them, and some of Aniston’s fondest memories are from the time they shared before the world discovered their romance. “We had so much fun falling in love,” she says wistfully. “It was so private; we kept it to ourselves for so long. It was something we were really proud of.” But after the relationship became public, it was always difficult to reconcile their mythic image with the quotidian reality of their private life, which was more likely to involve watching television, ordering takeout, and having close friends over than swanning around on red carpets. Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. “We were put on a pedestal, but we were just a couple like anybody else,” Aniston says. “When we were home, we’d watch the shows we loved, and one time there was this program called It’s Good to Be Brad and Jen. It was all about us going to Scotland and Greece and having our matching S.U.V.’s, and it wasn’t my life—I’d never even been to some of these places, but even I got sucked in. We’re sitting there saying, ‘Yeah, boy, it sure must be good to be Brad and Jen!’ So is it our responsibility to demystify this, to say, ‘This is not what it’s like—it’s not that fabulous, not that great’? There’s no doubt our life is fortunate, but … “ But even golden couples struggle with the formidable challenges of marriage. “It’s like the ebb and flow of every relationship,” Aniston says. “It’s hard; it gets easy; it gets fun again. What’s hard to sustain is some ideal that it’s perfect. That’s ridiculous. What’s fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person, and looking across the room and saying, ‘I’m still here. And I still love you.’ You re-meet, reconnect. You have marriages within marriages within marriages. That’s what I love about marriage. That’s what I want in marriage. It’s unfortunate, but we live in a very disposable society. Those moments where it looks like ‘Uh-oh, this isn’t working!’—those are the most important, transformative moments. Most couples draw up divorce papers when they’re missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection.” She sighs heavily and turns away to light a Merit cigarette. “That’s not Brad’s view of it,” she says, glum again. “We believe in different things, I guess. You can’t force a relationship, even if it’s your view of how you would like it to be conducted. Obviously two people leave a relationship because there’s a different thought pattern happening. My goal is to try and achieve a very deep, committed relationship. That’s what I’m interested in, but it’s someone’s prerogative to be or not to be in or out of a relationship.” “I think Jen wanted to work it out, and I don’t think he wanted to work it out,” Andrea Bendewald observes. “I don’t think he knew what he wanted.” Nevertheless, Aniston has only kind words about her marriage. “I still feel so lucky to have experienced it. I wouldn’t know what I know now if I hadn’t been married to Brad,” she says. “I love Brad; I really love him. I will love him for the rest of my life. He’s a fantastic man. I don’t regret any of it, and I’m not going to beat myself up about it. We spent seven very intense years together; we taught each other a lot—about healing, and about fun. We helped each other through a lot, and I really value that. It was a beautiful, complicated relationship. The sad thing, for me, is the way it’s been reduced to a Hollywood cliché—or maybe it’s just a human cliché. I have a lot of compassion for everyone going through this.”  As for what went wrong, Aniston rejects any simplistic explanation. “It’s just complicated,” she says. “Relationships are complicated, whether they’re friendships or business relationships or parent relationships. I don’t think anybody in a marriage gets to a point where they feel like ‘We’ve got it!’ You’re two people continually evolving, and there will be times when those changes clash. There are all these levels of growth—and when you stop growing together, that’s when the problems happen.” Friends say that it was always difficult for Aniston and Pitt to maintain the intimacy they craved while juggling their demanding work schedules, which often required long separations. Those tensions notwithstanding, Aniston believed her marriage was the real thing. “We both did,” she says. So what happened? “I think—it changed,” she says haltingly. “We both changed.” She sighs again. “You do the best you can, and I think we did. We did the best we could.” Both of them? She looks me straight in the eye. “Both parties,” she says. But nagging questions remain about Pitt’s conduct during the months leading up to their separation. “She was committed to the marriage,” says Bendewald. “He wanted to figure out who he was and what he wanted, but he seemed to want to do it without being married. She wanted him to figure out what he wanted and stay married. He didn’t think he could do that, so at that point she was like, ‘O.K., go figure it out.’” Throughout that period, Pitt insisted that his relationship with Jolie was not the cause of his marital discontent, but his actions since the separation have suggested otherwise. “I just don’t know what happened,” Aniston admits. “There’s a lot I don’t understand, a lot I don’t know, and probably never will know, really. So I choose to take away with me as much integrity and dignity and respect for what that relationship was as I can. I feel as if I’m trying to scrounge around and pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus.” Does she buy Brad’s claim that he didn’t cheat on her before they separated? “I choose to believe my husband,” Aniston says. “At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised by anything, but I would much rather choose to believe him.”  Their friends are still trying to parse what happened with Jolie. “I don’t think he started an affair physically, but I think he was attracted to her,” says Courteney Cox, who vacationed with her husband, David Arquette, and the Pitts on Anguilla just before they announced their separation. “There was a connection, and he was honest about that with Jen. Most of the time, when people are attracted to other people, they don’t tell. At least he was honest about it. It was an attraction that he fought for a period of time.” He may have been fighting it, but Pitt virtually checked out of his marriage as soon as he began working with Jolie, according to Aniston’s intimates. “He was gone,” says one. Aniston has met Jolie only once, when she took a passing opportunity to say hello. “It was on the lot of Friends—I pulled over and introduced myself,” Aniston recalls. “I said, ‘Brad is so excited about working with you. I hope you guys have a really good time.’” But he soon became emotionally unavailable to his wife, at a time when she needed him desperately. Pitt’s withdrawal coincided with the end of Friends, which Aniston experienced as a huge loss. “That was really painful. It was a family, and I don’t do great with families splitting up,” says Aniston, who was deeply wounded by her parents’ bitter divorce, which happened when she was 9. “It was hard to have such a wonderful constant in your life, a place to go every day, and then all of a sudden it’s not there.” When she reached out for her husband’s support, she didn’t get it. “He just wasn’t there for me,” she says. To the amazement of Aniston’s friends, Pitt didn’t even show up for the final taping of Friends. “He was working,” she says, still defending him, even though movie stars have been known to request changes in a shooting schedule to accommodate events that are important to them.  Although she isn’t talking to Pitt these days, Aniston remains in regular contact with his mother, whom she loves dearly, and she doesn’t rule out a better relationship with Brad in the future. “I really do hope that someday we can be friends again,” she says. She certainly doesn’t regret her four-and-a-half-year marriage—not even the million-dollar wedding with 50,000 flowers, a 40-member gospel choir, a Greek bouzouki band, and fireworks exploding over the Pacific. (“It was fantastic!” she says.) But she does have other regrets. “There’s a lot I would probably do differently,” she says. “I’d take more vacations—getting away from work, enjoying each other in different environments. But there was always something preventing it; either he was working or I was.” She made more profound mistakes as well. “I wouldn’t give over so much of myself, which I did at times,” she admits. “It was that thing about being a nurturer; I love taking care of people, and I definitely put his needs before mine sometimes. It’s seamless; somewhere along the way, you sort of lose yourself. You just don’t know when it happens. It’s such an insidious thing, you don’t really see where it started—and where you ended. There’s no one to blame but yourself. I’ve always been that way in relationships, even with my mom. It’s not the healthiest. I feel like I’ve broken the pattern now. I’ll never let myself down like that again. I feel like my sense of self is being strengthened because of it.” Aniston’s unhappy family history colored her experience of marriage from the outset. “I come from a fighting family, and I had a tough time arguing,” she says. “Fighting scared me. I wouldn’t speak up for myself. That’s something I’ve learned; I will always speak my mind.” In recent months, the process of healing from the breakup with Brad has also created a new openness to healing relations with her mother. Their estrangement began nearly a decade ago, when Nancy Aniston gossiped about Jennifer on a television show, and worsened when she tried to cash in on Jennifer’s fame by writing an appalling book called From Mother and Daughter to Friends. Jennifer severed all contact, but she is now re-assessing their relationship. “We’ve exchanged messages,” she says. “Our doors are open. We’re taking baby steps. It’s a good thing.” Although Aniston incurred criticism for distancing herself from her mother, who did not attend her wedding, she offers no apologies. “I feel pretty good about the choices I’ve made. The choice of not speaking to Mom for a while—that’s ours. Nobody else has to understand it. The same thing with Brad and myself,” she says. “I wouldn’t change my childhood, I wouldn’t change my heartaches, I wouldn’t change my successes. I wouldn’t change any of it, because I really love who I am, and am continuing to become. “Besides, it’s all in the past,” she adds. “This doesn’t kill you. You move on. You can’t let the devastation of a divorce take over and win—let it make you this bitter, closed-off, angry, skeptical person. Then you’re just falling victim to it. You don’t want to shut your heart down. You don’t want to feel that when a marriage ends, your life is over. You can survive anything. Compared to what other people are surviving out there in the world, this is not so bad, in the grand scheme of things. Human endurance is unbelievable. Think of what mothers of soldiers have to rise above! Everything’s relative.” She looks down at her firm, fit body. “Nothing’s broke,” she says. Catching the quizzical look on my face, she concedes, “Maybe a little bruised.”  A few weeks later, on a stiflingly hot day in Chicago, Aniston and I are sitting in her hotel suite looking out on Lake Michigan, which is studded with little white boats. I’ve just told her about the gossip magazine that says she’s registered here as “Mrs. Smith.” The report claims Aniston is taking perverse pleasure in making hotel staffers address her as Mrs. Smith, even though they know perfectly well who she is. The only problem with this amusing tidbit is that it’s not true. “I wish I’d thought of it,” says Aniston, who is registered under an entirely different, although equally humorous, name. Despite her vow of abstinence, she succumbed to a celebrity magazine the other evening—and immediately regretted it. “I feel like I’ve fallen off the wagon,” she moans. Unfortunately, the first publication she picked up featured an insult from Kimberly Stewart, Rod’s party-girl daughter. “She said I’m homely,” Aniston says. “It literally ruined my night. I got my feelings very hurt, actually. That was my instant Karma.” She has always fretted about her appearance, although that is often hard for others to believe. Posing for her Vanity Fair cover shoot, Aniston was equally fetching in French-dance-hall-girl black stockings and in a half-open oversize shirt that evoked every man’s favorite just-rolled-out-of-bed look. With her tousled hair, cobalt-blue eyes, and dazzling smile, she seemed the ultimate adorable sexpot. Far from pining away in seclusion, she appeared to be sending a far more spirited message—like “Eat your heart out, Brad!” Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. But Aniston has never been able to reconcile the glamorous Jen on page or screen with the self-doubting woman she sees in the mirror, and the current tabloid coverage has exacerbated that gap. “It’s literally two different people—the real me, and the ‘Jen’ they write about, ‘fighting back,’ ‘getting revenge’—everything I couldn’t be farther from wanting to do,” she says. “So I’m back on the wagon.” When she arrived in Chicago to film The Break-Up, the gossip media, frantic for a new development, immediately plunged her into a torrid romance with her co-star, Vince Vaughn. This affair apparently does not exist. “I adore Vince Vaughn, but I’m not going out with Vince Vaughn,” she says. “I barely know the guy. We’ve exchanged a wine-and-cheese basket for the start of the movie, and we’ve gone out to dinner with the director and other people. We’ve got to get to know each other.” But is Aniston seeing him—or anyone else? “Nobody,” she says firmly. “I like a lot of people, but I am sooo not ‘in like’ with anybody. I am really enjoying being by myself. I’m excited that I know there’s somebody out there for me, but I am absolutely in no rush. This is all very fresh, very new. This was a seven-year relationship that was very dear, very complicated, very special. I need to honor it.”  Aside from her initial flurry of tears, Aniston remains calm and thoughtful through hours of conversation with me over the course of several weeks. But there is one final topic to be addressed, and it’s the most hurtful of all. The rumor that Jolie is pregnant with Pitt’s child has swept around the world; some reports even have her finishing her first trimester. When I ask Aniston about that, she looks as if I’ve stabbed her in the heart. Her eyes well up and spill over. Several long minutes go by as the tears keep rolling down her cheeks; she bites her lip, seemingly unable to speak. Finally she shakes her head; this subject is simply too excruciating to discuss. “My worst fear is that Jen will have to face them having a baby together soon, because that would be beyond beyond painful,” says Kristin Hahn.	1
The fashion fairytale continues!  One week after Bee Shaffer, daughter of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, married Italian film director Francesco Carrozzini, son of the late Vogue Italia’s editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, in a Long Island ceremony, the two had a second wedding ceremony in Portofino, Italy.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The couple said “I do” for the second time in front of a small group of friends and family, including Carrozzini’s aunt, Carla Sozzani (sister of his mother) in the town’s San Giorgio church.  Because of the couple’s strict no social media policy during their first wedding, this is the first time we’ve officially seen Shaffer in a wedding gown. The bride chose an ivory V-neck lace gown with a tea-length skirt and matching lace veil. She accessorized with a cross necklace and gold strappy sandals.  BACKGRID  The groom wore a navy double-breasted suit with brown loafers.  While it’s still unknown what dress design Shaffer wore for her first nuptials, there are rumors it’s being kept under wraps until it can be unveiled in an upcoming Vogue issue.  Neilson Barnard/Getty Images  According to WWD, the couple visited Sozzani’s grave after the ceremony. Carrozzini changed into jeans and a T-shirt for the visit, while Shaffer remained in her lace dress but took off her veil.  The couple confirmed their engagement to PEOPLE in March 2017 and two months later, Shaffer showed off her engagement ring for the first time on the Met Gala red carpet.	0
Mulan is funny, beautifully animated, and features one of the most courageous and loyal Disney characters out there. In preparation for your weekend viewing, here are 13 things you might not know about this beloved film:  1. Mulan took five years to complete.    2. It took 700 animators, artists, and technicians to complete the film.    3. They brewed 1,630 pounds of coffee during production.    4. The directors, Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, made a cameo towards the end of the film.    5. The character of Cri-Kee was championed by the late Joe Grant, who was one of the oldest Disney animators at the time (he worked on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs). He first suggested the character, and all throughout development, Joe would slip sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors’ door.    6. The filmmakers had to take several passes at the “Reflection” lyrics. They wanted to express that Mulan really didn’t want anything, except to be herself and to make her dad proud.    7. When Chi Fu calls out the names of people to serve in the army, they’re actually the names of some of the staff. The glowing Chinese calligraphy is also the names of artists that worked on the production.    8. In the sequence where Mulan prepares to leave home, we see a face looking at her every time she makes a decision. These faces represent the ancestors, and make us feel like they know what she’s doing.    9. Filmmakers wrote three song options for Mushu to sing when he introduced himself to Mulan, but every time they added one in, it seemed to halt the movie. Mushu’s song was eventually cut from the film.    10. There was a lot of debate about how low Ming-Na Wen, the voice of Mulan, should make her voice when Mulan was pretending to be a boy. It was hard to have her do a low voice throughout the entire film, so the directors had Ming-Na start low, and cheat her way back up to her normal voice.    11. At one point in development, the general was not Shang’s dad, but they changed that later on, feeling that it gave Mulan more emotional weight. Both Shang and Mulan do what they do to honor their fathers.    12. Jackie Chan voiced Shang in the Chinese version of Mulan.    13. According to producer Pam Coates, the crowd bowing to Mulan at the end wraps up what the team was trying to express with the film. Mulan is a woman who, because she is true to her heart and true to herself, actually alters the way society thinks.    Posted 4 years Ago	0

"Death of Diana redirects here. For information on the murder of Diana Miller, see Murder of Diana Miller  On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel in Paris, France. Her companion, Dodi Fayed, and the driver of the Mercedes S280, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. A fourth passenger in the car, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, was seriously injured but survived.  Although the media blamed the behaviour of the paparazzi who followed the car, a French judicial investigation in 1999 found that the crash was caused by Henri Paul, who lost control of the Mercedes at high speed while he was intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs. Paul was the deputy head of security at the Hôtel Ritz at the time of the crash and had goaded the paparazzi waiting outside the hotel earlier.[1] His inebriation may have been made worse by anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his body.[2][3] The investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.[4] After hearing evidence at the British inquest in 2008, a jury returned to a verdict of ""unlawful killing"" by Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.[5]  Diana's death caused a substantial outpouring of worldwide grief, including numerous floral tributes and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2 billion people. The Royal Family were criticised in the press for their reaction to Diana's death.  Circumstances [ edit ]  Events preceding the crash [ edit ]  A car similar to that involved in the accident.  On Saturday, 30 August 1997, Diana left Sardinia on a private jet and arrived in Paris with Dodi Fayed, the son of Mohamed Al-Fayed.[6] They had stopped there en route to London, having spent the preceding nine days together on board Mohamed Al-Fayed's yacht Jonikal on the French and Italian Riviera. They had intended to stay there for the night. Mohamed Al-Fayed was and is the owner of the Hôtel Ritz Paris. He also owned an apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel, just off the Avenue des Champs Elysées.  Henri Paul, the deputy head of security at the Ritz Hotel, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 in order to elude the paparazzi;[9] a decoy vehicle left the Ritz first from the main entrance on Place Vendôme, attracting a throng of photographers. Diana and Fayed then departed from the hotel's rear entrance,[10] Rue Cambon at around 00:20 on 31 August CEST (22:20 on 30 August UTC), heading for the apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye. They did this to avoid the nearly 30 photographers waiting in the front of the hotel.[10] They were the rear passengers; Trevor Rees-Jones, a member of the Fayed family's personal protection team, was in the (right) front passenger seat. It was believed that Diana and Dodi were not wearing seat belts.[12] After leaving the Rue Cambon and crossing the Place de la Concorde, they drove along Cours la Reine and Cours Albert 1er – the embankment road along the right bank of the River Seine – into the Place de l'Alma underpass.[13]  The crash [ edit ]  At 12:23 a.m., Paul lost control of the vehicle at the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel. The car struck the righthand wall and then swerved to the left of the two-lane carriageway before it collided head-on with the 13th pillar that supported the roof.[14] The car was travelling at an estimated speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).[15] It then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards, finally coming to a stop. The impact caused substantial damage, particularly to the front half of the vehicle, as there was no guard rail between the pillars to prevent this. Witnesses arriving shortly after the accident reported smoke.[17] Witnesses also reported that photographers on motorcycles ""swarmed the Mercedes sedan before it entered the tunnel.""[12]  The aftermath [ edit ]  The entrance to the Pont de l'Alma Tunnel, the site where Diana was fatally injured  As the victims lay in the wrecked car, the photographers, who had been driving slower and were accordingly some distance behind the Mercedes, reached the scene. The photographers were on motorcycles.[10] Some rushed to help, tried to open the doors and help the victims, while some of them took pictures. Airbags were deployed.[19] Police arrived on scene around 10 minutes after the crash at 00:30 and an ambulance was on site five minutes after the police, according to witnesses.[19] France Info radio reported that one photographer was beaten by witnesses who were horrified by the scene.[12] Five of the photographers were taken into custody.[17] Later, two others were detained and around 20 rolls of film were taken from the photographers.[12] Police also impounded their vehicles.[12] Firemen also arrived to help remove the victims.[20]  Still conscious, Rees-Jones had suffered multiple serious facial injuries and a head contusion.[21] The front occupants' airbags had functioned normally.[22] The occupants were not wearing seat belts.[a] Diana, who had been sitting in the right rear passenger seat, was still conscious. Critically injured, Diana was reported to murmur repeatedly, ""Oh my God,"" and after the photographers and other helpers were pushed away by police, ""Leave me alone.""[23] In June 2007 the Channel 4 documentary Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel claimed that the first person to touch Diana was Dr. Maillez,[24] who chanced upon the scene. He reported that Diana had no visible injuries but was in shock. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00 am. She then went into cardiac arrest and following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again.[26] She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18 am, left the scene at 1:41 am and arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at 2:06 am.[27]  Fayed had been sitting in the left rear passenger seat and was shortly afterwards pronounced dead.[28] Paul was declared dead on removal from the wreckage. Both were taken to the Institut Médico-Légal (IML), the Paris mortuary, not to a hospital. Paul was later found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.175 grams per 100 mL of blood - about 3.5 times the legal limit in France.[21]  Despite attempts to save her, Diana's internal injuries were too extensive: her heart had been displaced to the right side of the chest, which tore the pulmonary vein and the pericardium. Despite lengthy resuscitation attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4:00 a.m.[31] Anesthesiologist Bruno Riou announced her death at 6 am at a news conference held at the hospital.[17][32]  Later that morning, Jean-Pierre Chevènement (French Minister of the Interior) visited the hospital with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.[33] At around 5:00 pm, Diana's former husband, Charles, Prince of Wales, and her two older sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, arrived in Paris. The group visited the hospital along with French President Jacques Chirac and thanked the doctors for trying to save her life.[35] Prince Charles accompanied Diana's body home on Sunday.[36] Her body was taken to the Hammersmith and Fulham mortuary in London for its autopsy later that day.[37]  Initial media reports stated Diana's car had collided with the pillar at 190 km/h (120 mph), and that the speedometer's needle had jammed at that position.[21] It was later announced the car's speed on collision was about 95–110 km/h (60–70 mph). The car was certainly travelling much faster than the speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph). In 1999, a French investigation concluded the Mercedes had come into contact with another vehicle (a white Fiat Uno) in the tunnel.[38] The driver of that vehicle has never been conclusively traced, although many believe the driver of the Fiat was Le Van Thanh but the specific vehicle has not been identified.[39] [38]  It was remarked by Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, that if the accident had been caused in part by being hounded by paparazzi, that it would be ""doubly tragic.""[10] Diana's brother also blamed tabloid media for her death.[40] An 18-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the crash was caused by Paul, who lost control at high speed while intoxicated.[41]  Mourning [ edit ]  Members of the public were invited to sign a book of condolence at St. James Palace.[42] All 11,000 light bulbs at Harrods were turned off and not switched on again until after the funeral.[42] Throughout the night, members of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and the Salvation Army provided support for people queuing along the Mall.[43] More than one million bouquets were left at her London home, Kensington Palace,[44] while at her family's estate of Althorp the public was asked to stop bringing flowers as the volume of people and flowers in the surrounding roads was said to be causing a threat to public safety.[45]  By 10 September, the pile of flowers outside Kensington Gardens was 5 feet (1.5 m) deep in places and the bottom layer had started to compost.[46] The people were quiet, queuing patiently to sign the book and leave their gifts. There were a few minor incidents. Fabio Piras, a Sardinian tourist, was given a one-week prison sentence on 10 September for having taken a teddy bear from the pile. When the sentence was later reduced to a £100 fine, Piras was punched in the face by a member of the public when he left the court.[47] The next day two Slovakian tourists, Maria Rigolova, a 54-year-old secondary school teacher and Agnese Sihelksa, a 50-year-old communications technician, were each given a 28-day prison sentence for having taken 11 teddy bears and a number of flowers from the pile outside the palace.[48] This was reduced to a fine of £200 each.[49]  Funeral [ edit ]  Early on, it was uncertain if it would be a state funeral since Diana had lost her royal status because of her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.[50]  Diana's death was met with extraordinary public expressions of grief, and her funeral at Westminster Abbey on 6 September drew an estimated 3 million mourners and onlookers in London,[51][52] and worldwide television coverage watched by 2.5 billion people.[53] It was aired to 200 countries in 44 languages.[54] Outside the Abbey and in Hyde Park crowds watched and listened to proceedings on large outdoor screens and speakers as guests filed in, including representatives of the many charities of which Diana was patron. Attendants included US First Lady Hillary Clinton, Bernadette Chirac, wife of the French President, Jacques Chirac and other celebrities, including Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and friends of Diana, George Michael and Elton John.[23][55] John performed a rewritten version of his song ""Candle in the Wind"" that was dedicated to her.[56] Protocol was disregarded when the guests applauded the speech by Diana's younger brother Earl Spencer, who strongly criticised the press and indirectly criticised the Royal Family for their treatment of her.[57] The funeral is estimated to have been watched by 31.5 million viewers in Britain. Precise calculation of the worldwide audience is not possible, but estimated at around 2.5 billion.[58]  After the end of the ceremony, the coffin was driven to Althorp in a Daimler hearse.[59] Mourners cast flowers at the funeral procession for almost the entire length of its journey and vehicles even stopped on the opposite carriageway of the M1 motorway as the cars passed.[60]  In a private ceremony, Diana was buried on an island in the middle of a lake called The Oval, which is part of the Pleasure Garden at Althorp.[61] In her coffin, she wore a black Catherine Walker dress and is clutching a rosary in her hands. The rosary had been a gift from Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a confidante of Diana, who had died the day before her funeral. A visitors' centre is open during summer months, with an exhibition about her and a walk around the lake. All profits are donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.[62]  Reactions [ edit ]  Some criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being ""hysterical"" and ""irrational"". As early as 1998 philosopher Anthony O'Hear identified the mourning as a defining point in the ""sentimentalisation of Britain"", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.[63] Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher responded to the reaction with ""The woman's dead. Shut up. Get over it"".[64] These criticisms were repeated on the 10th anniversary, when journalist Jonathan Freedland expressed the opinion that ""It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary ... we cringe to think about it."" In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple suggested ""sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself"".[65] Some cultural analysts disagreed. Sociologist Deborah Steinberg pointed out that many Britons associated Diana not with the Royal Family but with social change and a more liberal society: ""I don't think it was hysteria, the loss of a public figure can be a touchstone for other issues.""[66] Carol Wallace of People Magazine said that the fascination with Diana's death had to do with ""the fairy tale failing to end happily – twice, first when she got divorced and now that she died.""[67]  Royal family [ edit ]  The Queen expressed her dismay at Diana's death when she found out.[68] Prince Charles was the person who told their sons about their mother's death.[68] The princes were told of her death before dawn, as Prince Charles had to wake them up to share the tragic news.[69] The boys were close to their mother.[69] On Sunday morning after Diana's death, Queen Elizabeth, Princes Charles, William and Harry all wore black to church services at Balmoral Castle.[70] Prince Charles, William and Harry would be coming back to London on Friday, September 5.[71] The Queen, who returned to London from Balmoral, agreed to a television broadcast to the nation.[72]  The Royal Family was criticised for a rigid adherence to protocol, and their concern to care for Diana's grieving sons, was interpreted as a lack of compassion.[73] In particular, the refusal of Buckingham Palace to fly the Royal Standard at half-mast provoked angry headlines in newspapers.[73][74] ""Where is our Queen? Where is her Flag?"" asked The Sun.[72] The Palace's stance was one of royal protocol: no flag could fly over Buckingham Palace, as the Royal Standard is only flown when the Queen is in residence, and the Queen was then in Scotland. The Royal Standard never flies at half-mast as it is the Sovereign's flag and there is never an interregnum or vacancy in the monarchy, as the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor. Finally, as a compromise, the Union Flag was flown at half-mast as the Queen left for Westminster Abbey on the day of the funeral.[72] This set a precedent, and Buckingham Palace has subsequently flown the Union Flag when the Queen is not in residence.[75] A rift between Prince Charles and the Queen's private secretary Sir Robert Fellowes (Diana's brother-in-law) was reported in the media over what the nature of the Princess's funeral should be with Charles demanding a public funeral and Fellowes supporting the Queen's idea of a private one.[76] The Palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.[76]  Prince Harry said in 2017 that the death of his mother caused severe depression and grief.[77] Prince William was 15 and Harry was 12 when Diana died.[78]  Politicians' reactions [ edit ]  President Bill Clinton's remarks on Diana's death  British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that he ""felt utterly devastated by the death of the Princess.""[50] President Bill Clinton said that he and his wife, Hillary Clinton were ""profoundly saddened"" when they found out about her death.[17] Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General said that her death ""has robbed the world of a consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of suffering children worldwide.""[70] In Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, condemned the paparazzi for their overzealous coverage of Diana.[79] Russian President Boris Yeltsin praised Diana's charity work in a statement saying ""All know of Princess Diana's big contribution to charitable work, and not only in Great Britain"".[80][81] Among other politicians who sent messages of condolences were South African President Nelson Mandela, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[80]  Public reactions [ edit ]  In London, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside of Buckingham Palace after the news of her death.[70] People started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared.[68] The BBC flew its flags at half-mast.[70] Both radio and television aired the British national anthem, ""God Save the Queen,"" in response to Diana's death.[68]  People in the United States were shocked at her death.[82] In Paris, thousands of people visited the site of the crash and the hospital where Diana died.[83] People brought flowers and also attempted to visit the Hotel Ritz, as well.[83] In Bosnia, a land-mine survivor, Jasminko Bjelic, who had met Diana only three weeks earlier, said, ""She was our friend.""[70] Following her death many celebrities including actors and singers blamed the paparazzi and condemned their reckless behavior.[84][85]  During the four weeks following her funeral, the suicide rate in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of deliberate self-harm by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years. Researchers suggest that this was caused by the ""identification"" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.[86] Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died. It also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries.[87] The same research showed that Diana's ""charitable endeavors"" and ""ability to identify with ordinary people"" were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people.[87] In the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress.[88]  The national grieving for Diana had economic effects. In the short term, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week. Traffic congestion in central London as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected productivity, and the CEBR estimated that would cost businesses £200 million, or a total loss of 0.1% of gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1997. However, in the long run the CEBR expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.[89]  Memorials [ edit ]  Flame of Liberty, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France The, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France  In the years after her death, interest in the life of Diana has remained high. As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the Flamme de la Liberté (Flame of Liberty), a monument near the Alma Tunnel related to the French donation of the Statue of Liberty to the United States. The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory. A permanent memorial, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004.[90]  Inquests [ edit ]  Under English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death.[91][92] A French judicial investigation had already been carried out but the 6,000-page report was never published.[93] On 6 January 2004, six years after her death, an inquest into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened in London held by Michael Burgess, the coroner of the Queen's household.[92] The coroner asked the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to make inquiries, in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident.[92][94] The police investigation reported its findings in Operation Paget in December 2006.[95]  In January 2006, Lord Stevens explained in an interview on GMTV that the case is substantially more complex than once thought. The Sunday Times wrote on 29 January 2006 that agents of the British secret service were cross-examined because they were in Paris at the time of the crash. It was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has been forthcoming).[96][97]  The inquests into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened on 8 January 2007, with Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss acting as Deputy Coroner of the Queen's Household for the Diana inquest and Assistant Deputy Coroner for Surrey in relation to the Fayed inquest. Butler-Sloss originally intended to sit without a jury;[98] this decision was later overturned by the High Court,[99] as well as the jurisdiction of the Coroner of the Queen's Household. On 24 April 2007, Butler-Sloss stepped down, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury.[100] The role of Coroner for the inquests was transferred to Lord Justice Scott Baker, who formally took up the role on 13 June as Coroner for Inner West London.[101]  On 27 July 2007, Baker, following representations for the lawyers of the interested parties, issued a list of issues likely to be raised at the inquest, many of which had been dealt with in great detail by Operation Paget:  Whether driver error on the part of Henri Paul caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether Henri Paul's ability to drive was impaired through drink or drugs Whether a Fiat Uno or any other vehicle caused or contributed to the collision Whether the actions of the Paparazzi caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether the road/tunnel layout and construction were inherently dangerous and, if so, whether this contributed to the collision Whether any bright/flashing lights contributed to or caused the collision and, if so, their source Whose decision it was that the Princess of Wales and Dodi Al Fayed should leave from the rear entrance to the Ritz and that Henri Paul should drive the vehicle Henri Paul's movements between 7 and 10 pm on 30 August 1997 The explanation for the money in Henri Paul's possession on 30 August 1997 and in his bank account Whether Andanson was in Paris on the night of the collision Whether Diana's life would have been saved if she had reached hospital sooner or if her medical treatment had been different Whether Diana was pregnant Whether Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were about to announce their engagement Whether and, if so in what circumstances, the Princess of Wales feared for her life The circumstances relating to the purchase of the ring The circumstances in which Diana's body was embalmed Whether the evidence of Tomlinson throws any light on the collision Whether the British or any other security services had any involvement in the collision Whether there was anything sinister about (i) the Cherruault burglary or (ii) the disturbance at the Big Pictures agency Whether correspondence belonging to the Princess of Wales (including some from Prince Philip) has disappeared, and if so the circumstances.[102]  The inquests officially began on 2 October 2007 with the swearing of a jury of six women and five men. Scott Baker delivered a lengthy opening statement giving general instructions to the jury and introducing the evidence.[103] The BBC reported that Mohamed Al-Fayed, having earlier reiterated his claim that his son and Diana were murdered by the Royal Family, immediately criticised the opening statement as biased.[104]  The inquest heard evidence from people connected with Diana and the events leading to her death, including Paul Burrell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, her stepmother, the survivor of the crash, and the former head of MI5.[105]  Scott Baker began his summing up to the jury on 31 March 2008.[106] He opened by telling the jury ""no-one except you and I and, I think, the gentleman in the public gallery with Diana and Fayed painted on his forehead sat through every word of evidence"" and concluded that there was ""not a shred of evidence"" that Diana's death had been ordered by the Duke of Edinburgh or organised by the security services.[107] Lord Justice Scott Baker concluded his summing up on Wednesday, 2 April 2008.[108] After summing up, the jury retired to consider five verdicts, namely unlawful killing by the negligence of either or both the following vehicles or Paul; accidental death or an open verdict.[106] The jury decided on 7 April 2008 that Diana had been unlawfully killed by the following vehicles.[109][110] Princes William and Harry released a statement in which they said that they ""agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful.""[111] Mohamed Al Fayed also said that he would accept the verdict and ""abandon his 10-year campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy"".[112]  The cost of the inquiry exceeded £12.5 million, with the coroner's inquest at £4.5 million, and a further £8 million spent on the Metropolitan Police investigation. It lasted 6 months and heard 250 witnesses, with the cost heavily criticised in the media.[113]  Related lawsuits [ edit ]  Nine photographers who had been following Diana and Dodi in 1997, were charged with manslaughter in France.[114] France's ""highest court"" dropped the charges in 2002.[114]  Three photographers who took pictures of the aftermath of the crash on 31 August 1997 had their photographs confiscated and were tried for invasion of privacy for taking pictures through the open door of the crashed car.[114][115] The photographers, who were part of the ""paparazzi"" were acquitted in 2003.[114]  Conspiracy theories [ edit ]  Although the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised.[116] Since February 1998, Fayed's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed (the owner of the Hôtel Ritz, where Paul worked, and thus potentially liable for wrongful death liability) has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,[117] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of the Royal Family.[118] His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation[2] and by Operation Paget, a Metropolitan Police Service inquiry that concluded in 2006.[119] An inquest headed by Lord Justice Scott Baker into the deaths of Diana and Fayed began at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, on 2 October 2007, a continuation of the inquest that began in 2004.[100] On 7 April 2008, the jury concluded that Diana and Fayed were the victims of an ""unlawful killing"" by the ""grossly negligent"" chauffeur Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles.[120] Additional factors were ""the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol"" and ""the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else"".[109]  On 17 August 2013, Scotland Yard revealed that they were examining the credibility of information from a source that alleged that Diana was murdered by a member of the British military.[121][122]  In the media [ edit ]  After Dark television discussion - ""After Diana"" - broadcast on A specialtelevision discussion - ""After Diana"" - broadcast on Channel 4 on 13 September 1997  Actor George Clooney publicly lambasted several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death. A few of the tabloids boycotted Clooney following the outburst, stating that he ""owed a fair portion of his celebrity"" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question.[123]  Diana was ranked third in the 2002 Great Britons poll sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the British public, after Sir Winston Churchill (1st) (a distant cousin), and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (2nd), just above Charles Darwin (4th), William Shakespeare (5th), and Isaac Newton (6th). That same year, another British poll named Diana's death as the most important event in the country's last 100 years.[124] Historian Nick Barrett criticised this outcome as being ""a pretty shocking result"".[125]  Later in 2004, US TV network CBS showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were ""part of a 4,000-page French government report."" It showed an intact rear side and centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat—the right rear door is fully open. The release of these pictures were poorly received in the UK, where it was felt that the privacy of Diana was being infringed.[126] Buckingham Palace, UK Prime Minister and Diana's brother condemned the action, while CBS defended its decision saying that the pictures ""are placed in journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given to Princess Diana just after the crash.""[127]  On 13 July 2006, Italian magazine Chi published photographs that showed Diana amid the wreckage of the car crash;[128] the photos were released despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published.[129][b] The editor of Chi defended his decision by saying he published the photographs simply because they had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of Diana.[129]  The British newspaper The Daily Express has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of Princess Diana following her death. A 2006 report in The Guardian showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including ""Perhaps Diana should have worn seatbelt"", ""Diana inquiry chief's laptop secrets stolen"", ""£250,000 a year bill to run Diana fountain"" and ""Diana seatbelt sabotage probe"".[130]  Internet coverage [ edit ]  Diana's death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. BBC News had set up online coverage of the general election earlier in 1997[131] and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana's death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it. Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full online news service was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel BBC News 24 on 9 November.[132]  See also [ edit ]  References [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ Although there are conflicting reports (such as BBC and CNN ), the investigation Operation Paget report notes ""Operation Paget's view is that none of the seat belts were being worn at the time of the impact, including that of Trevor Rees-Jones.""

Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.	1
According to a new promotional video, a feud is erupting on the set of the new season of The Voice between veteran judge Blake Shelton and newcomer Jennifer Hudson, and the competition to get the winning vocalist on their respective teams is getting fierce.  In a video titled The Real Coaches of The Voice, a fun spoof of the Real Housewives franchise, Shelton and Hudson are butting heads when they have both turned their chair and are trying to convince contestants to choose between the two. The promo features snide comments from Shelton when he talks about Hudson’s rookie win as a coach on The Voice U.K.  “I feel like Jennifer Hudson is coming from the minor leagues into the big-time boys here,” says Shelton. “She was on The Voice UK, and she won, but this is different.”  Which Coach will be the SHORE thing? #TheVoice returns September 25. A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Aug 11, 2017 at 4:59pm PDT  The Dreamgirls star and former American Idol contestant is not intimidated by the country superstar’s remarks. She is confident that her time on the British version of the show has prepared for a win in the States.  The question is, though, is the feud just all in fun for a promo video, or are Hudson’s diva ways really causing problems on the set?  According to reports Hudson is not getting along with the other judges, the contestants, or the crew. A source claims she is being intolerable by screaming at people to get her way, being disruptive, and causing delays. Hudson is so hard to work with that the insider claims everyone is hoping this will be her only season on the show.  Girl looks like a dream. ? #TheVoice A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Sep 9, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT  If there really are problems on the set, the show is keeping it on the down low, and instead presenting a fun and playful, yet competitive vibe for the upcoming season.  For example, Shelton reveals at the end of the promo that he and his former rival turned best friend, coach Adam Levine, have decided to try to get along this season. The video featured the two professing their love for one another in a sarcastic attempt to mend fences.  Shelton and Levine have battled for years on the reality competition, but everyone knows the relationship is more of a bromance than a feud.

"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost was expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were ""between £2 million and £4 million"". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force's annual budget, but at the time the cost was ""well below the £4 million required to make a claim"".[41] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[42]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit""; for women, ""Day Dress and Hat"".[43]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[44] It was made of ""double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza"" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[45][46] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[45][47] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[48] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[45][49] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[50] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[45]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[45][49][51] Markle's hair was rolled up with ""face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears"",[52] and was done by Serge Normant.[53] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[52][54] The look was described as ""a soft brown eyeshadow"" with minimal makeup on the face.[52] Her nails were painted in a ""neutral pink-y beige"" for the ceremony.[55] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained ""forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle"".[45] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[45][56] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[57] For the customary bridal themes of ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"", Markle had her gown and veil (the ""new""), the Queen's tiara (the ""borrowed""), sprigs of myrtle taken from ""a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet"" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the ""old""), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the ""blue"").[58][59][60] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[61]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[62] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[63][64] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[62] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[65] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[63][66] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[63]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[67][68] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[69] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[70]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[71][72] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[73] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[74][75]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[76][77] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[78][79] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[80]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[81]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[84] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[85] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[86][87]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[88][89] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[90][91] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[92] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[93]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to ""to love and to cherish"" each other.[94] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[94] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[95] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[96] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[94] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[97]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[98] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[99] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang ""Stand By Me"" in what was described as ""an incredible and powerful moment"".[100] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[101] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[102][103]  The bride walked down the aisle to ""Eternal source of light divine"" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[104] Other music during the service included the motet ""If Ye Love Me"" by Thomas Tallis; the song ""Stand by Me"" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and ""The Lord bless you and keep you"" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and ""This Little Light of Mine"" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[105]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[62] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[88] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[106][107] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[107] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[62] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[108][109][110] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[111]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[112] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[113]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[114]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an ""official list"" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[115] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[116] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[116] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was ""a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother"".[62]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a ""direct relationship"" with the couple.[117] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[118] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[117] The invitees outside the chapel were ""people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children"".[119]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly ""deeply upset"" by her omission.[120]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[121][122][123][124][125]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[126]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[127]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[128][129]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.

Is Heather Locklear Joining RHOBH?!  The actress might be getting her own diamond!              Genny Glassman  In a turn of events that would truly be shocking, is it possible that actress Heather Locklear will be joining the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? We’re not so sure that this story checks out.  The buzz started yesterday, April 9, when Lisa Rinna was a guest on Andy Cohen’s radio show, Radio Andy. The two talked Housewives, Amelia’s history with mental health, and Andy even probed Lisa about her relationship her former Melrose Place co-star.  “Did you have a friendship with [Heather Locklear]?” the Bravo host asked.  “I did and I will say to you, I learned more from Heather […] I learned professionalism, coming in and owning a set, and being kind to everyone, and polite, and on time, knew their lines, funny,” Rinna tells him. “Heather Locklear was everything and she was one of the biggest starts of that time.”  But things have not been smooth sailing for Locklear as of late. “It’s sad whatever demons she’s dealing with,” Andy says.  Of course Andy is referring to Locklear’s brush with the law that happened earlier this year. In February, People reported that the ’90s icon was arrested on suspicion of domestic battery against her then-boyfriend, Chris Heisser, and three counts of battery on a police officer.  Reportedly, Locklear started the altercation when she threw a Red Bull can at Heisser because she felt that he had “lied to her.” She told police officers that Heisser had then tried to strangle her in retaliation, and while these validity of these claims proved to be inconclusive, (Heisser denies these claims, saying “I never touched her”), police did find blood on the bridge of Heisser’s nose and red marks across his chest. He told them that Locklear had attacked him, “bit his face,” and struck him from anywhere “between 20 – 30 minutes.” When police arrived, things got ugly quickly and the night ended with Locklear in a pair of handcuffs yelling at police, “You f***ing deserve your kids to die! You f***ing deserve it!” Yikes.  So is Heather strong enough to duke it out with the ladies of the RHOBH? “You know it was my fantasy — wouldn’t it have been great to get Heather on the Beverly Hills Housewives?” Andy tells Rinna.  “Maybe we still can,” Lisa Rinna answers.  “Start checking it with her,” Andy pleads.  Naturally anyone who brings the drama is prime housewives material in our book, but in the case of Heather Locklear we think that this is one rumor that should stay a fantasy.  Let us know, do you think Heather Locklear should be on reality TV?	1

"Staci has spoken! By now, you've all heard Miranda Lambert has declared she is ""happily single,"" but you might not know how Staci Felker feels about it.  While she didn't outwardly address her now ex husband's split from Lambert, she did take to social media to defend him right before news of the split went public.  But keep in mind, the Turnpike Troubadours canceled their final two shows on Miranda's tour BEFORE news of the breakup surfaced, so we are 99.99999 percent sure Staci was already aware of the breakup when she responded to a fan on Instagram.  Here's how it all went down:  An Instagrammer decided to tell Staci she should remove all the photos of Evan from her social accounts.  Staci seemed to frown upon that idea.  According to Fox News, Staci responded by saying that Evan and his family will always mean something to her.  She went on to say she is very appreciative for the advice, but she has nothing but well wishes for Evan and his band.  She also revealed that a ""wife's love"" doesn't just fade away after six months, referring to the time her and Evan have been broken up.  Hmmm ...  What do you think her comments mean?  Over the last six months, there has been a tremendous amount of drama surrounding Staci, so her response was definitely unexpected.  Do you think her and Evan are in the midst of getting back together?  QCWriter is a journalist who is fueled by espresso and motivated by determination.

Sex And The City star Kim Cattrall's brother is missing and she's pleading for any information on his whereabouts.  The 61-year-old actress took to Instagram early Sunday morning and posted that Chris Cattrall, her brother, has been missing from his home in Lacombe, Alberta, Canada, since Tuesday.  'MISSING! This is my brother Christopher Cattrall or Chris as we call him,' Cattrall said on Instagram.  Kim Cattrall posted on Instagram early Sunday morning that brother Chris Cattrall has been missing from home in Alberta, Canada, since Tuesday  Chris's keys, wallet and phone were all left behind and the door to his home was unlocked  'He has been missing since Tuesday, January the 30th from his home in Lacombe, Alberta Canada. His keys, cell phone,& wallet left on the table and his front door unlocked.  'This is not like Chris. He he would never leave his unlocked home without those items nor his 7 beloved dogs. Chris is 55 years old, 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, blue eyes, short brown hair, goatee, average build & usually wearing a waist length hooded winter coat with black gloves, blue jeans and calf high black winter boots.  'He’s a one of a kind brother. Help us bring him home safe. Please spread the world. Many thanks for reading this. Kim #centralalberta #blackfalds #reddeeralberta.'  Another person posted on Facebook that families and friends were 'desperate for any news of him' adding that Chris had been the best man at their wedding.  His step daughter, Katie Osmond, also took to social media to share photos of the man.  'I know it’s hard to find people when they’ve gone missing. I’m praying that he comes home safe and unharmed,' Osmond said on Facebook.  'He’s a one of a kind brother. Help us bring him home safe. Please spread the world,' Cattrall said on her Sunday Instagram post  His step daughter, Katie Osmond (center), also took to social media to share photos of the man  'He’s a one of a kind brother. Help us bring him home safe. Please spread the world,' Cattrall said on her Sunday Instagram post  Last October, Cattrall appeared on the show Life Stories in the UK with DailyMail.com Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan. When asked if she were friends in real life with the SATC gang, the 61-year-old was adamant that they weren't.  'We've never been friends. We've been colleagues and in some ways it's a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,' she said.  Her comments came after DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that plans for a third Sex and the City movie had been shelved over claims that Cattrall had made several 'outrageous' demands of the studio just weeks before filming was due to begin.  Cattrall then hit back during her interview with Piers, insisting she simply hadn't wanted to do a third movie, and claiming that she had 'never asked for any money or any projects', while also commenting on her professional relationship with each of the other three stars of the hit series.  Last October, Cattrall appeared on the ITV show Life Stories with DailyMail.com Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and offered her take on the SATC gang  It's been suggested that Cattrall's character Samantha Jones could be recast, with some suggesting Sharon Stone could play the part.  Sarah Jessica Parker admitted to Andy Cohen that Stone was 'a really interesting idea,' but also suggested that Samantha could be removed from the series altogether.  'I think once everybody has thoroughly experienced the grieving process, then Michael Patrick King can go back and sort of ponder what he might want to do and how he might want to proceed,' she said in response to whether they might simply kill Samantha off.  Anyone with information about her missing brother is asked to contact Blackfalds RCMP at 403-885-3300.	0
"From Miley Cyrus' secret marriage to her pregnancy, there have been a lot of rumours in the air lately about the Malibu hitmaker's personal life.  Recently her Thanksgiving tweet sparked speculation about the songstress being pregnant which apparently drove her so crazy that she took to Twitter to retweet the picture and addressed all the rumours.  Also read: Miley Cyrus pregnant? Malibu singer has a hilarious response to the baby bump rumours  She wrote: ""RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a s— ton of tufurkey.""  Even after that, Hollywood Life reported that the Wrecking Ball singer wanted to get 'pregnant ASAP' with fiance Liam Hemsworth.  An insider reportedly told the website, ""Miley's totally ready to start a family with Liam.""  Although she did not appreciate the speculations that she was pregnant ""because it is something she has thought about for a while that hasn't happened yet.""  RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a shit ton of tufurkey pic.twitter.com/rjNjquxvLb — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 23, 2017  The source reiterated: ""She wants to be married, she wants to start a family but Liam isn't 100% ready for all of that just yet. She can only hint about it so much.""  Hence those kinds of baby bump rumours have driven her crazy ""because she would want nothing more than for those rumours to be true.""  ""Miley is just waiting for Liam to be just as ready as she has become. She knows that it is all in time but if it was up to her, she would love to speed up the process,"" the source also told Hollywood LIfe.  But as usual, Gossip Cop exposed the truth behind all these speculations and claimed that the insider's statement is entirely fabricated.  Given that, the Hollywood Life's report looks contrary to its own insider's statements. While Miley herself rubbished all the pregnancy rumours on Twitter during Thanksgiving, how is it possible that she told the insider about her willingness to get pregnant?  Besides this, the songstress clarified in a radio interview a few months back that she is in no rush to have kids. Talking to 104.3 Myfm, Cyrus said, ""No, I love pigs more than kids, to be honest.""  Thus it is quite clear that the story about Cyrus wanting to ""get pregnant ASAP"" and ""have babies with Hemsworth"" is entirely made up."	1

This album wouldn't exist if it wasn't for these guys that have written these songs. You know, I had to sprinkle a little Mars sauce on it.""  Congrats Bruno on a Grammys domination well-deserved!"	0
Is there a chance that Queen Elizabeth understands the verb troll in its 21st-century iteration? Is there such a thing as the Royal Urban Dictionary?  QEII might not be able to define troll, but it seems the 92-year-old monarch may be well-versed in executing it. And her victim might have been one Donald J. Trump.  The president, of course, paid Queen Elizabeth a visit last week at Windsor Castle during his controversial visit to London, where hundreds of thousands of Brits took to the streets to protest his presence.  Trump, who was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, didn’t exactly endear himself to the queen when he broke protocol and walked ahead of her. Video of the breach of etiquette went viral.  Britain’s Queen Elizabeth walks around US President Donald Trump as they inspect the guard at Windsor Castle pic.twitter.com/2DWfIlTeMT — RTÉ News (@rtenews) July 13, 2018  The Trumps were also late for their scheduled tea with the queen. Bloody hell!  But it seems Her Royal Highness might have gotten revenge preemptively. According to E!News, Queen Elizabeth wore different brooches during Trump’s three days in the United Kingdom, with each broach having special significance, as described on the blog From Her Majesty’s Jewel Vault.  A Twitter user who goes by the handle @SamuraiKnitter tweeted extensively about the “brooch warfare.”  Queen Elizabeth “does hundreds and hundreds of appearances, and maybe 95% or high, she wears a brooch. And the brooch is ALWAYS significant. Badges of military regiments – she inspects some troops, she wears the badge of them to do it,” @SamuraiKnitter wrote.  QE also does hundreds and hundreds of appearances, and maybe 95% or higher, she wears a brooch. And the brooch is ALWAYS significant. Badges of military regiments – she inspects some troops, she wears the badge of them to do it. — Bitch. STILL my superhero name. (@SamuraiKnitter) July 15, 2018  On Trump’s arrival in London on July 12, Queen Elizabeth’s choice of brooch was gifted to her by Barack and Michelle Obama during their last visit to London as president and first lady. The brooch was not a state gift, according to @SamuraiKnitter, as the Obamas paid for it themselves.  “The US has given QE jewelry before over the years and I bet her dresser could put hands on any and all of it given five minutes,” said @SamuraiTwitter. “But she chose the most SENTIMENTAL piece in the collection, the one that was given OUT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OBAMAS AS PEOPLE.”  The US has given QE jewelry before over the years and I bet her dresser could put hands on any and all of it given five minutes.

On Day 2 of Trump’s visit, the queen wore a brooch from new U.S. frenemy Canada.  Please explain, @SamuraiKnitter.  “It’s called the Sapphire Jubillee Brooch, and it was given to the Queen of England as a gift for ruling eleventy billion (okay, 66 years). From Canada. You know, who Trump’s been screaming about and insulting. The commonwealth country and of the UK’s greatest allies. Them.”  It's called the Sapphire Jubillee Brooch, and it was given to the Queen of England as a gift for ruling for eleventy billion (okay, 65). From Canada.

(@SamuraiKnitter) July 15, 2018  For tea with the Trumps, Queen Elizabeth forewent the brooch altogether and safety-pinned a flamin’ hot Cheeto to her lapel.  OK, we kid about that last one.  What she actually wore was a brooch handed down from her mother — the very same one that the Queen Mother wore to the funeral of King George VI, Queen Elizabeth’s father.  “QE rolled up to tea with the tRUmps wearing the brooch her mother wore to her father’s STATE FUNERAL,” tweeted @SamuraiKnitter.

With the all-ladies Ocean’s 8 coming this summer, I find that lately all I want to do is watch Ocean’s Eleven, Ocean’s Twelve (yes, I do enjoy Ocean’s Twelve, let me live), and Ocean’s Thirteen. This is a simple enough desire, right? But unfortunately, for some reason, they are never all streaming at the same time. It’s like, one month Ocean’s Eleven will be here, and then Ocean’s Thirteen ends up on another streaming platform, and everyone has just agreed to forget about Ocean’s Twelve (except me), so that’s nowhere. It’s driving me mad. Can’t a girl get her Danny Ocean caper fix when she wants it??  Well, thankfully, someone has been looking at my vision board, and in February all three Ocean’s movies are coming to Netflix. Yes, along with binging (and re-binging) your favorite shows, you’ll be able to binge-watch Danny Ocean steal SO MUCH STUFF, thanks to Netflix. Would it be weird to throw an actual Ocean’s trilogy party? Does that sound like the best night ever, or is it just me? Would you show up to that? (You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.)  Ocean’s Eleven, Ocean’s Twelve, and Ocean’s Thirteen all land on Netflix on February 1st, so mark your calendars. That gives you plenty of time to watch all three movies *at least* a dozen times before Ocean’s 8 lands in theaters on June 8th, 2018 (nice work there with the multiple 8s).  These three titles are just a handful of the dozens of new shows, movies, and specials that will land on Netflix next month. We’ll have the full list on Tuesday, so be sure and check back here then to make sure you can start planning your viewing schedule for the month. Or start planning your own Ocean’s party. You do you.	0
"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.

Barack Obama has announced plans to become secretary general of the United Nations, allowing him to advance his globalist agenda on the world’s stage.According to Al-Jarida, Obama has no intention to step away from the spotlight, much to the dismay of other world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.”Townhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility.Last year after his speech at West Point, some pointed out that he sounded an awful lot like he was campaigning for the role.	1
The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things.Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him.Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?”‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome.He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine.His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare.Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting.His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them.After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can.Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons?He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago.His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it.The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen.He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything.He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.AREN’T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT!source:https://100percentfedup.com	1
"Katy Hudson redirects here. For Perry's debut album released under this name, see Katy Hudson (album) . For the actress of a similar name, see Kate Hudson  Not to be confused with Katie Perry  Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.  Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of her second album, a pop rock record titled One of the Boys, and its singles ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". The former track also sparked controversy for its sapphic themes. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and was her first album to top the U.S. Billboard 200. It topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with the singles ""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" while ""The One That Got Away"" reached number 3 on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's album Bad. In March 2012, she re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs ""Part of Me"" and ""Wide Awake"". Her fourth album, Prism (2013), was her second to peak atop the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"". Her fifth album, Witness (2017), delved into electropop and became her third album to reach number one in the U.S. Its most successful single, ""Chained to the Rhythm"", broke the record for Spotify's most streamed track by a female artist within 24 hours upon its release.  Perry has received many awards, including four Guinness World Records, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award, and has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011–2018. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 40 million albums and over 100 million records globally throughout her career. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018.  Life and career  1984–1998: Early life  Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (née Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson.[2] Her parents are born again Christians, each having turned to religion after a ""wild youth"".[3] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry.[4] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry.[5] She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer,[6] and an older sister, Angela.[7] From ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[2][8] Her family struggled financially,[9] sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.[10]  Growing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the term ""luck"" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs ""angeled eggs"".[11] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[12] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends.[13] While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, ""I pray all the time – for self-control, for humility.""[14] Wanting to be like Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who let her take vocal lessons as Angela was at the time. She began training at age 9,[15] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[3] singing in church from ages 9 to 17.[16] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[3][17] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[9] She tried to ""be a bit like the typical Californian girl"" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Perry's brother David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence.[18] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[19]  1999–2006: Career beginnings  Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15,[20] during her freshman year of high school,[21] and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[22] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[12] After signing with Red Hill Records, Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson. She released the album on March 6, 2001, and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour[23][24] while also embarking on other performances of her own in the United States.[25] Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[26][27] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17.[29] In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.  In 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[31] Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin and Dr. Luke.[32][33] In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team The Matrix become a ""real group"", Perry recorded with them.[34] Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.[35]  Perry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, ""Simple"", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[36] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song ""Old Habits Die Hard"",[37] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[38] In September 2004, Blender named Perry ""The Next Big Thing"".[36] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single ""Goodbye for Now"" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for ""Learn to Fly"" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for ""Cupid's Chokehold"".[39]  2007–2009: Breakthrough with One of the Boys  After Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an ""undeniable smash"" to her existing material.[40][41] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to ""Ur So Gay"", aimed at introducing her to the music market.[42] A digital EP led by ""Ur So Gay"" was later released to create interest.[3][43] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising the track on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008,[44] stating it was her ""favorite song"" at the time.[45] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode ""Life's Too Short""[46] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[47]  Perry was part of the 2008 Warped Tour lineup  Perry released her first single with Capitol, ""I Kissed a Girl"", on April 28, 2008,[48] as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it.[43] The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[49] ""I Kissed a Girl"" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[50] One of the Boys, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US Billboard 200.[51][52] The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide.[53] ""Hot n Cold"" was released the following September[54] and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100[55] while topping charts in Germany,[56] Canada,[57] the Netherlands[58] and Austria.[59] Later singles ""Thinking of You"" and ""Waking Up in Vegas"" were released in 2009[60][61] and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.[55] The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.[38][62]  After finishing the 2008 Warped Tour,[63] Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act.[64] At the 2009 Brit Awards, she also won the award for International Female Solo Artist.[65] Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[66] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009.[67] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards.[68] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys as well as one new song, ""Brick by Brick"", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's ""Hackensack"".[69] It was released on November 17, 2009.[70] Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song ""Starstrukk"" in September 2009,[71] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled ""If We Ever Meet Again"", from his album Shock Value II, in January 2010.[72][73] The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the ""Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist"", for digital single sales of over two million copies.[74]  After her relationship with Travis McCoy ended in December 2008,[75] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[76] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[77] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[78]  2010–2012: Teenage Dream and marriage  After serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[79] Perry released ""California Gurls"" featuring Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[80] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[81] She also served as a guest judge on The X Factor UK later that month[82] before releasing the album's second single, ""Teenage Dream"", in July.[83] ""Teenage Dream"" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September.[84] Released on August 24, 2010,[85] Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[86] and received mixed reviews from music critics.[87] It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.[88] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[89] In October, ""Firework"" was released as the album's third single.[90] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[91]  ""E.T."" featuring Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[92] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the chart.[93] ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" followed as the fifth single in June,[94] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[95] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[96] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[97] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[98] In October, ""The One That Got Away"" was released as the album's sixth single.[99] The song peaked at number three in the US[100] and number two in Canada.[57] On January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[101] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units.[102] On February 13, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, ""Part of Me"", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[103] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23.[104] ""Wide Awake"" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[105] peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100[100] and number one in Canada[57] and New Zealand.[106]  Perry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[66] from February 2011 to January 2012.[107] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[108] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[109] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[110] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online.[111] Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.[112]  In December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled ""The Fight Before Christmas"".[113][114] In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode ""Oh Honey"", playing a woman known as Honey.[115] The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012.[116] She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011. The film was a financial success worldwide,[117] while critics gave mostly negative reviews.[118] She hosted Saturday Night Live on December 10, 2011, with Robyn as the episode's musical guest.

All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.""[219] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as ""the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.""[220]  Perry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette's frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, ""Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless."" Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[221] Perry intends to become ""more of a Joni Mitchell"", releasing folk and acoustic music.[222] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare.

I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes."" —Perry on her confidence as a songwriter[233]  While Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love.

She told Marie Claire: ""I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.""[14] Kristen Wiig commented that ""as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.""[220] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, ""being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.""[241] The New York Times labeled her ""the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation"".[242] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent ""clichés"".[243] Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene,[244][245] Jessie James,[246] Kelly Clarkson,[247] Lesley Roy,[248] Britney Spears,[249] Iggy Azalea,[250] Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.[251]  Voice  Perry has a contralto vocal range.[252][253] Her singing has received both praise and criticism.

Incensed over Donna Karan’s defense of Harvey Weinstein, Megyn Kelly laid into the fashion designer on Tuesday’s episode of Megyn Kelly TODAY, declaring that she’s “done with Donna Karan” while also inviting her on the program.  “Donna Karan, in the wake of the disturbing allegations about famed movie producer Harvey Weinstein allegedly harassing several women, used the power of her voice to attack women,” said Kelly, 46, who famously leveled sexual harassment claims against her former Fox News boss, the late Roger Ailes, in her 2016 book, Settle for More. “In an interview with the DailyMail.com on the red carpet Sunday night, Karan was asked about Harvey Weinstein, who she described as a wonderful person. And then she went on to raise what she apparently considers to be the burning question here: Are women who are getting harassed ‘asking for it’?”  After playing a clip of the comments — for which Karan has since apologized, telling the Associated Press they are “not representative of how I feel or what I believe” — Kelly turned the focus to her interview with one of Weinstein’s accusers, TV journalist Lauren Sivan, who on Monday’s episode told Kelly about her “disgusting” experience with Weinstein. “Weirdly, I never thought to ask Lauren whether her skirt brought on that [restuarant] vestibule incident because her outfit is totally irrelevant — and most rational people know that,” said Kelly.  Questioning Karan’s statement, Kelly challenged her “wrong” thinking: “There are laws in this country. Laws. I don’t give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office. That doesn’t invite or make it okay for her superior to harass her. It makes it okay for her boss to say, ‘Go home and change.’ That’s it. The truth is sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe; it has to do with power and control and sexual proclivities that a superior chooses not to reign in. How insulting, by the way, to men, as well? Like they are a bunch of animals who cannot behave themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh, right? This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming.”  Kelly continued: “How about we not pile on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices, despite the risks and to stand up for themselves — which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their fashion choices.”  Then came Kelly’s kicker: “And speaking of fashion choices, here’s one for you: I’m done with Donna Karan.”  Despite her dismissive message, Kelly invited Karan on the show for “an honest discussion about how [Karan] really feels,” adding, “If she’s really sorry, if she really was taken out of context, if she really doesn’t believe that way, explain those comments.”  With her comments Tuesday, Kelly joined a growing list of celebrities speaking out against Weinstein, whose scandal erupted following an Oct. 5 New York Times exposé alleging the movie mogul has been sexually harassing women for three decades. Weinstein has since been fired by The Weinstein Company and apologized for “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past” in a statement to the Times. On Tuesday, a report posted by the New Yorker alleged more sexual misconduct claims, including assault, against Weinstein, which he also denied.  Watch Kelly’s segment in the video above.

"Music's hottest couple is a couple no more. Blake Shelton left his girlfriend of two years Gwen Stefani high and dry when he dumped her before heading off on tour in February, In Touch has exclusively learned, and she's not taking it well. “Gwen doesn’t know what hit her,” said the insider. “She’s heartbroken.”  But wait, Gwen just posted a photo with Blake three days ago, so what gives? Apparently, it's a desperate attempt to ignore the truth. “She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,” said another insider. “But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.” He certainly hasn't reciprocated her online affection.  A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 1, 2018 at 3:52pm PST  “Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,"" explained the source. Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""  “Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.” Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times.  Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships.

Blake Shelton is releasing a third track, “Turnin’ Me On,” from his album Texoma Shore and it’s a love song inspired by his girlfriend Gwen Stefani.  The new release from Blake has the country singer and “The Voice” coach singing about all the things that turn him on about his girlfriend of 3 years, Gwen.  “She’s turning me on, turning me on / Pushing my buttons like it ain’t no thing / If I’m what she wants, she gets what she wants / The neon’s buzzing when she pulls that string / Turning me on like it’s her job / Sometimes I think she must get off on / Turning me on, turning me on.”  Blake began writing the song by himself and as he got on a roll, he asked his songwriter friend to help him finish it.  “We’re sitting on my bus one day early in 2017 and I think I was in Baton Rouge,” said Blake. “I was up there alone and I had my guitar, started playing a little melody that I was hearing in my head and next thing you know I started writing a song. I wrote a verse, then I wrote a chorus, then I realized it was going somewhere and I felt good about it. Like I always [have] in the last couple of years, I called up my friend Jessi Alexander and said, ‘Man, I think I’m onto something and I need somebody way better than me to try to bring this thing home.’ She and I and Josh Osborne ended up writing this song, I’m super proud of it—and it’s not hard to figure out who this song is about.”  After hearing Blake record the new song, what did Gwen think of her beau’s ode to her? “She liked it,” Blake told Seth Meyers. “I didn’t say I wrote the song about her then. I just said I wrote the song and then she figured it out. There’s a line that says ‘She’s Revlon red,’ because she’s the Revlon girl.”  “And when my body’s beside hers / There ain’t no turning back / She’s Revlon red in the blackest night / Lighting up the room in the world just like she’s turnin’ me on.”  “Turnin’ Me On,” featured on Blake’s current album Texoma Shore, is the follow up to Blake’s No. 1 hit “I’ll Name the Dogs,” and most recent single, “I Lived It.”	1
"Justin Bieber Dodges Water Bottle From Crowd After Refusing to Sing 'Despacito': 'I Don't Even Know It'  While fans may know the lyrics to Justin Bieber's guest spot on the Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee hit ""Despacito"" word for word, it seems that the star isn't quite up to speed.  The Biebs refused to sing the primarily Spanish-language remix while performing at Summerburst Festival in Stockholm over the weekend -- and almost got struck by an attendee's water bottle for it.  ""I can't do 'Despacito,'"" Bieber admitted onstage after an audience member requested the track. ""I don't even know it.""  While some crowd members continued to cheer, one pelted a water bottle at Bieber, just missing the singer's head. ""Don't throw things at me, please,"" Bieber responded calmly.  It's not the first time ""Despacito"" has brought Bieber trouble: When he tried to perform the Song of the Summer contender at New York City club 1OAK in May, fans caught the singer ad-libbing ""I don't know the words, so I say 'Dorito,'"" in between mumbled lyrics.  Fonsi, for one, has forgiven Bieber before for messing up the lyrics, admitting himself that ""the chorus is not easy to sing."" And none of this has diminished the success of the song, which is currently leading the Billboard Hot 100 for the fifth consecutive week.

Warner Bros. put a spell on Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”  In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the charmingly clumsy Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore. It’s teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn’t one for taking orders well.  The David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to recapture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers.  “I can’t move against Grindelwald,” Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. “It has to be you.”  The trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings. J.K. Rowling, the Harry Potter author who wrote the screenplays for both “Fantastic Beasts” movies, has since defended the decision to cast Depp on Twitter, citing both Heard’s and Depp’s desires to move on.  “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” marks Yates’ fifth foray into the Wizarding World. He previously directed the last four movies in the original Harry Potter franchise, as well as the first “Fantastic Beasts” installment. His is set to direct the remaining three movies rounding out the “Fantastic Beasts” saga, with Rowling continuing on as a screenwriter. “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” hits theaters Nov. 16.	0
"Laugh it off. Oliver Hudson joked about his sister Kate Hudson's rumored romance with Brad Pitt on Instagram on Friday, January 20.  The Rules of Engagement alum, 40, shared a photo of a recent Star magazine cover, which claimed Kate, 37, and Pitt, 53, are ""getting serious"" and have moved in together. Oliver was clearly amused by the tabloid rumors and wrote a lengthy (and sarcastic) response to shut down the speculation.  ""Yeah and it's been hell!! He's messy as s–t!"" Oliver captioned his Instagram post. ""He drinks out of the f–king carton and leaves the door open when he's taking a dump!! And this is when he's at MY house!!! He's already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won't speak to me. He insists my kids call him uncle B and lost my youngest at the Santa Monica pier for 2 days.. thank god for amber alert.""  ""My mom [Goldie Hawn]'s overtly flirting with him!"" he continued.

This isn't the first time the Hudson family has laughed off rumors of a romance between Kate and Pitt, who is in the midst of a bitter divorce and custody battle with Angelina Jolie. Days before Oliver's Instagram post, a paparazzo asked Hawn, 71, if she was ""ready to have Brad as a son-in-law,"" causing the Snatched actress to burst out laughing, according to a video posted by The Sun.

Robert Pattinson says he was just kidding around about being asked to perform bestiality in his new movie Good Time.  The actor made the joke Thursday night on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he said he refused his director’s request to act out a very NSFW scene involving a dog. Pattinson’s comments soon went viral, even eliciting praise from the animal rights group PETA, which thanked him for declining to participate.  Now, the actor, 31, is trying to set the record straight. “The story I told on Jimmy Kimmel last night seems to have spiraled out of control,” he said in a statement. “What didn’t come across is that this was supposed to be a joke. No one at all expected or assumed that anything like that would happen on the Good Time set.”  He continued, “We are all huge animal lovers and would obviously never do anything to harm an animal. Everyone involved in Good Time are amazing professionals and have come together to make a movie that I’m extremely proud of. I feel embarrassed that in the moment, I was trying to make Jimmy laugh, only to create confusion and a false impression.”  Pattinson, 31, plays the role of Connie, a New Yorker who will go to all sorts of measures to save his brother and resorts to robbing banks. The actor revealed that his character also happens to have an affinity for dogs, putting Pattinson in a tricky situation on set.  “Oh, God, I don’t know if I can say this. There’s a lot of things in this movie which really cross the line of reality. It’s not even on the line, it’s way beyond the line,” Pattinson said on the talk show. “There was initially this scene — I don’t think I should say this — but it’s like, my character, Connie, has this affinity with dogs. He thinks he is a dog in a previous life and he thinks he has control over animals and stuff.”  A drug dealer then busts into the room where Pattinson’s character is performing a sexual act on the dog.  Aurore Marechal/ABACA/INSTARimages.com  The Twilight star burst into laughter when recounting the scene to Jimmy Kimmel, saying that the “director was like, ‘Just do it for real, man! Don’t be a p–!’ And then the dog’s owner was like, ‘Well, he’s a breeder, I mean, you can.’ He’s like, ‘You just gotta massage the inside of his thighs.’”  In the end they went with a more staged approach.  “I didn’t agree to do the real one, so we made a fake red rocket,” he revealed. “It was fun. It’ll be on the DVD extras.”  “Wow, Hollywood is a great place folks. It really is. If you get a chance to send your kids to film school,” Kimmel teased.

The Hamilton County sheriff’s website confirmed that the American television series Teen Mom’s Ryan Edwards got arrested in Tennessee on Tuesday.  The Teen Mom OG star’s arrest took place less than twenty-four hours after the fact that he and his wife Mackenzie Edwards are expecting their very first child together was revealed.  A source said in a statement about the arrest that it was related to his charge of last year before he went to rehab. The source added that it is not anything new and it is not a new arrest for heroin but it was his original charge of last April.  According to the reports, Ryan got arrested at his house on Tuesday when the cops executed a warrant for violating the probation. A spokesperson for Hamilton County Jail told that he was held on a bond of 5,000 dollars and that he was bonded out at about 10:15 pm.  On the night of Monday, the MTV viewers were shown a preview of the next week’s Teen Mom OG episode, in which Mackenzie was seen to be showing a producer a positive pregnancy test. On Tuesday, the same day as that of the arrest of Ryan, Mackenzie said in a statement that her husband, who also shares a son named Bentley with his ex Maci Bookout, is very excited about her pregnancy. Mackenzie even has got 4-year-old son named Hudson with her ex Zachary Stephens.  Ryan and Mackenzie tied the knot secretly in May 2017 before he went to the rehab. Several sources confirmed earlier in the month of June that Ryan had been in the rehab for around two weeks and that he was actually doing well. Ryan Edward’s stay in the rehab occurred shortly after the allegations of substance abuse were made on Teen Mom OG. The couple exchanged vows in a second ceremony in the month of November.	0
Does Margot Robbie reciprocate co-star Brad Pitt’s rumored feelings for her? We’ll explain what’s really going on between these two!  Sorry, this won’t be a Mr. & Mrs. Smith situation. Margot Robbie, 28, has eyes for one man, and it’s not for her co-star Brad Pitt, 54! The two actors began filming for Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time In Hollywood earlier this summer, and rumors sprung that Brad had the hots for Margot. While that’s yet to be confirmed, we can confirm this: Margot is respecting her wedding vows! “Margot is madly in love with her husband Tom,” a friend of Margot’s shares EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. Just a reminder — Margot wedded Tom Ackerley, 28, the producer for her film I, Tonya, on December 18, 2016! “Even if Brad tried, he would never be able to woo her away.”  Margot’s admiration for Brad — because really, you can’t help but admire the knockout — is purely professional! “Margot thinks Brad is amazing, hot, sexy, really talented and she has the utmost respect for him, but there’s absolutely no crush on her part,” the Suicide Squad‘s friend adds. “She’s only got eyes for Tom. Margot thinks her husband is the best looking guy on the planet, even Brad Pitt can’t compete with Tom, at least not for Margot.” Yup, you heard that right — not even Brad Pitt! Well, we hope Tom can relax after hearing those kind words. As we’ve told you, Margot’s husband has reportedly been wary of Brad, supposedly dropping by onset of Once Upon a Time In Hollywood and “keeping a close eye on Brad,” a source close to Margot and Tom claimed to Life & Style in its Aug. 29 issue.  How did this rumored love triangle mess even start? Well, Brad was reportedly “smitten” with Margot, another Life & Style source claimed, which we reported on July 26. The source went so far as to claim that the actors’ other co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, “has called [Brad] out for layering it on so thick [with Margot].” None of this has been confirmed, and Brad could just be a happy (almost legal) bachelor minding his own business! He does have an ongoing custody battle with his soon-to-be ex-wife Angelina Jolie, 43, to worry about.	1
The writer-director says he supports the campaign and that his ‘wonderful record’ with women makes him an important ally  Woody Allen has spoken about his support for the #MeToo movement, saying that he should be “the poster boy”.  In an interview on Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos, the writer-director was asked if there was any truth behind the allegation that he sexually abused his daughter, Dylan Farrow.  Woody Allen's son Moses Farrow defends father over sexual assault claims Read more  “Of course not, this is just so crazy,” he said. “This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue. And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children.”  The story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page.  “Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.”  But the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn’t be equated with him, as he was “only accused by one woman in a child custody case” and believes he should be heralded as an important ally.  “As I say, I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” he said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one – big ones, famous ones, ones starting out – have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”  In a statement released last year, Allen referred to Weinstein as a “sad, sick man”.  Last month saw Allen’s son Moses Farrow defend him in a blogpost, calling his sister’s story a “discredited allegation” and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of “brainwashing” and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words “beyond hurtful”.  When he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: “Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left. It’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.”  Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities. The romantic comedy is yet to receive a release date.	0

"CLOSE During an interview with 'Vanity Fair,' actress Angelina Jolie said life after splitting from husband Brad Pitt has been focused on looking after her health and her children. Wochit  Angelina Jolie attending the annual lecture of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation at the United Nations office in Geneva on March 15, 2017. (Photo: FABRICE COFFRINI, AFP/Getty Images)  Angelina Jolie is opening up about her difficult year, from a Bell's Palsy diagnosis to her split from Brad Pitt.  In a Vanity Fair cover story, Jolie reveals that in addition to high blood pressure, she developed Bell’s Palsy, a condition resulting from damage to facial nerves, which caused one side of her face to droop.  “Sometimes women in families put themselves last... until it manifests itself in their own health,"" Jolie, 42, said, credited acupuncture for a full recovery. Vanity Fair did not elaborate on the cause of the nerve damage.  Jolie, who underwent a hysterectomy in 2015 and a double mastectomy in 2013 after learning she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, also said she has been dealing with more gray hair and drier skin. ""I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had,"" she said.

""Things became ‘difficult,'"" she told the magazine.  She is adamant, however, that the A-list couple's jet-set lifestyle with their six children was not ""in any way a negative.”  “That was not the problem,"" she said. ""That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children...They’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them.""  Jolie praised her children Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9 and Knox, 9, for being ""very brave"" during the divorce.  Divorce negotiations are still ongoing between the couple. As a family, Jolie says, she and the children are still recovering.  ""We’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing...They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some...from life, from things in life,"" she explained somewhat cryptically.  But the actress-director stays stoic in front of her children, Jolie said. “I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it’s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything’s going to be all right even when you’re not sure it is.”  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2v89EZm"	0
CBS’ new top programming executives addressed the network’s struggles with onscreen diversity Tuesday — including the recent controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from “Hawaii Five-0.”  “We love both those actors and did not want to lose them,” CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Tuesday. “We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around.”  In June, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park exited “Hawaii Five-O.” As Variety reported at the time, the actors had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, but failed to reach deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series.  The departure of the show’s only two series regulars of Asian descent over a salary dispute involving the pay scale of their white co-stars sparked criticism of CBS on social media and in the press.  Kahl did not go into details of the negotiation, saying, “In my mind it was purely a business transaction.” He characterized the departure of veteran actors as natural for a show entering its eighth season. “It’s happened on ‘CSI,’ it’s happened on ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ it’s happened on ‘Law and Order: SVU.'”  Related Erinn Hayes’ Character to Be Killed Off ‘Kevin Can Wait’ to Make Room for Leah Remini  Kahl appeared at TCA alongside senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. The two fielded multiple questions about the network’s poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.  “We had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,” Sherman said.  Sherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season’s crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network’s top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.  Reporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS’ casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS’ series.  “I personally don’t think that has anything to do with it,” Kahl said, adding of the casting department, “They’re fantastic at what they do,” and noting that it has “cast many diverse roles in the past.”  Pressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, “They’ve been together for a long time. That’s the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.”  As his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS’ diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.  “We can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,” Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. “Every single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.”  He added, “We said in the past that we’re going to do better, and we are doing better.”	0

"Angelina Jolie is not going without sleep and food.  National Enquirer reported that the ""Maleficent"" star is reportedly on the ""edge of a total collapse"" because she overworked, barely eats and does not have enough sleep.  ""There are times she feels light-headed and is on the verge of passing out,"" a so-called informant said. As for Jolie's food intake, she allegedly eats ""mostly morsels of steamed veggies and fruit, very little protein, and water. ""  ""She drinks wine and smokes cigarettes. The fear is she's headed for a physical meltdown,"" the source added.  Gossip Cop debunked the said report. According to the publication, Jolie, 42, has suffered legitimate health problems in the past, but it is not true that Brad Pitt's ex is ""going without food or sleep.""  They reached out to Jolie's friend who described the reports about Jolie's unhealthy sleeping and eating habit as ""completely nonsense."" Also, Jolie already said that she is taking charge of her health. She knows that this is important considering that she has the kids with her following her split from Pitt.  ""I actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I'm being smart about my choices,"" Jolie told Vanity Fair for its September cover. ""And I'm putting my family first, and I'm in charge of my life and my health. I think that's what makes a woman complete.""  Just recently, Jolie explained why she opted to have her kids homeschooled than attend a regular class. The ""Salt"" star admitted that she was concerned about their quality of education.  ""It bothered me how little I was taught in school,"" Jolie said. ""I do worry about my children's education. I homeschool partially because they are from around the world and it's very … I didn't want them to have the same education I had when it came to Vietnam or Cambodia.""  At the time, Jolie and Pitt are working together for the best of their six children. ""Angelina is busy with everything she is doing, including being a super mom to her kids,"" a source told the publication. ""But she is doing fine and working with Brad on ways to continue their lives so everyone is happy.""  Jolie and Pitt are selling their palatial property in Long Island for $55 million. Their family occupied the estate when she was filming ""Salt"" in 2009."	1
Just as important as the Met Gala theme reveal—next year’s show is titled “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”—is the announcement of Anna Wintour’s cohosts. Taking over the duties carried out last time around by Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Gisele Bündchen, and Tom Brady are three women who are as talented as they are glamorous: Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace.  The big question, of course, is what will they wear? While we count down to the big night—May 7, 2018—we look back at each woman’s personal Met Gala history searching for clues.  Amal Clooney  Met Gala Debut: 2015  Galas Attended: 1  Clooney made a stunning party-of-the-year debut in a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal gown by John Galliano. Its deep red color was presumably a nod to the exhibition’s theme, “China: Through the Looking Glass,” but this dress was an homage to the wearer. Strapless with a corset-like top, its skirt flared slightly in a cascade of tiers creating the narrow, figure-flattering silhouette Clooney prefers.  Advertisement 1 / 7  Rihanna  Met Gala Debut: 2007  Galas Attended: 7  Gala Performances: 2  Rihanna is a Met Gala all-star: No one gets more into the spirit of things than @badgalriri. Consider the yolk-color Guo Pei gown she wore to the 2015 event that not only put the Chinese designer on the map, but also blew up the memosphere. For anyone other than Rihanna, that look would have been a tough one to top, but she managed, arriving at this year’s Comme des Garçons exhibition in a fresh-off-the-runway look by the woman of the hour, Rei Kawakubo. By now, we know to expect the unexpected from Rihanna—even an impromptu performance, like the one she gave with Kanye West in 2009.  Advertisement 1 / 16  Donatella Versace  Met Gala Debut (on record): 1995  Galas Attended: 16  In 1997, the Costume Institute remembered Gianni Versace’s life and work with an exhibition. This year, to mark the 20th anniversary of her brother’s death, Donatella Versace presented a tribute collection to her brother for Spring 2018. Next May, she’ll cohost the gala that she used to attend by his side. While we know what Donatella will wear—one of her own glamorous creations, cierto—precisely which A-listers will form her entourage remains to be seen.

"They may have called it quits on their relationship but ex-couple Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin are still emotional about each other. Despite making it clear that she is not keen on getting back with her ex, the Teen Mom star couldn't help but break down on the latest episode of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars.  The challenging episode involved a fake drill, whereby Marroquin was placed on a so-called ""death bed"" pretending to have met with a fatal accident while Lowry reads a letter from him. But it was only a matter of time before the 25-year-old reality star got all teary-eyed.  ""This is f****d up,"" Lowry said before walking out of the apparent hospital room, only to be forced back in moments later. In an unexpected turn of events, the mother-of-three seemed to be completely emotional, fighting back tears throughout the exercise.  ""I care about you so much and I never knocked you as a father,"" Lowry said to the father of her child. ""I'll make sure that our son is taken care of.""  ""It was nice to get some emotion out of her,"" Marroquin later opens up in a confessional adding, ""You never tell me how you feel ... If you were to die, a part of me would die. You will always have a piece of my heart.""  Lowry and Marroquin, who share three-year-old son Lincoln, have been open about their struggles as a former couple and joined the Marriage Boot Camp to work on their co-parenting skills. However, it's been more of a bumpy road with the MTV star squashing much of Marroquin's approaches.  Regardless of their differences, though, 24-year-old Marroquin appeared hopeful during Friday's episode (20 October) as he expressed his desire to win back his soon-to-be ex-wife.  ""I love her to death, that's the mother of my child,"" the reality star said in a sneak peek video. ""I'm hoping that there's a small chance Kailyn and I can resolve whatever issues we have and give our marriage a legitimate shot."""	0

"There's no other show that knows how to deliver drama quite like Grey's Anatomy, and that's just when the cameras are rolling. Even as the Shondaland series heads into its fourteenth season, Grey's Anatomy has just as much drama off screen as it does on.  There are only two cast members from the original line-ups of interns still on Grey's Anatomy: the eponymous Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Given the insanely high death rate at Seattle Grace, are you really surprised that there's some wild stuff going on behind the scenes?  Why did T.R. Knight really leave the show? What scene did ABC force Shonda Rhimes to change in season 1? Which actor was the entire cast rumored to be resentful of? And did Shonda Rhimes actually kill off Derek because she didn't like him?  Here are 15 Dark Behind-The-Scenes Secrets From Grey's Anatomy You Had No Idea About. Let us know which ones surprised you the most!  15 Patrick Dempsey was terrified of Shonda Rhimes  When Patrick Dempsey first met Shonda Rhimes to discuss being a part of the show, he couldn't help but notice the blank stare she gave him as everyone else in the room talked. He was completely terrified of her, and after that meeting, he said he was convinced she hated him. He was certain that it wasn't going to work, and that he wouldn't be a part of what was, at the time, an untitled drama about surgeons.  Luckily for him, the blank stare and lack of warmth wasn't because Shonda Rhimes hated him. She was just trying to imagine how she could possibly write dialogue for such a ""dreamy"" actor. And thus, Derek Shepherd, aka McDreamy, was created. (That affection, according to rumors, couldn't last forever. RIP, McDreamy.)  14 The network forced Shonda Rhimes to change an early scene  In the early days of Grey's Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes received a lot of criticism from ABC. Reportedly, she was told to make several changes to her writing in the first season, including a scene with Alex Karev and Cristina Yang that was originally written for episode two, ""The First Cut is the Deepest"". The scene was supposed to show the two of them them racing around the hospital to see who could deliver the most bad news to patients in the shortest amount of time, only to be shamed by the last patient.  However, the network forced Rhimes to cut the scene from the episode because they felt it went too far. ""I think the term that was used to describe me to my face was, 'If you think you're funny, you're sick,'"" Rhimes said. ""I was stunned."" Instead, the new version of that scene shows Alex and Cristina racing to give out good news (and avoid getting too many hugs from patients).  13 Shonda Rhimes kept track of how often a network exec. cursed at her  Speaking of criticism, Shonda Rhimes has admitted to clashing with the network quite a bit in the first two seasons of Grey's Anatomy. The Alex and Cristina scene was just one incident, and Rhimes struggled with how she could continue to revise her writing without changing the show entirely.  The head of ABC at the time, Steve McPherson, apparently said some pretty nasty things to Rhimes after about the fourth or fifth episode. ""He said really horrible things to me,"" she said. ""I literally started keeping a list of how many times he said a certain swear word to me. After that, I was like, 'OK, we're dead.'""  Thankfully, the show wasn't dead, and instead had a strong series premiere -- and is now heading into its fourteenth season.  12 Meredith was supposed to date Burke, but Ellen Pompeo refused  Seriously. Think about that one for a second. Can you imagine anything other than MerDer? Can you picture Meredith saying ""pick me, choose me, love me"" to anyone other than McDreamy himself? Well, things were almost very different.  Apparently, Shonda Rhimes wanted Meredith's love interest to be Isaiah Washington's Preston Burke rather than Patrick Dempsey's Derek Shepherd. Ellen Pompeo, however, didn't like that idea at all. Because she's in an interracial relationship in real life, she didn't want to also be in one on screen, because she felt it would ""hit too close to home.""  Pompeo lobbied for MerDer to be the show's big romance and instead, it was Cristina who fell for Burke, that is until he left her at the altar.  11 Isaiah Washington reportedly choked Patrick Dempsey on set  There seem to be several different versions of this story, but Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey definitely admitted to getting into a heated argument on set. They were in each other's faces, yelling at each other, and one rumor has it that Washington had Dempsey by the throat. Either way, it was definitely a dramatic incident, and one that was apparently all about the work ethic on set.  The good news is that no one was hurt, and later, it's said that the two were back to work with no problems. When Washington talked about the incident after that, he laughed that he had been so close to Dempsey that he could appreciate how blue his eyes were. Well, that's nice!  10 Isaiah Washington used a homophobic slur and was fired  Speaking of the fight between Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey, Washington used a homophobic slur at some point in that exchange, and T.R. Knight, who played George O'Malley on the show, apparently felt that slur was directed at him. Now, since then, Knight has come out as a gay man, but at the time, that wasn't case.  Washington apologized for using the word later, saying, “I can neither defend nor explain my behavior,” Washington said in a statement. “I can also no longer deny to myself that there are issues I obviously need to examine within my own soul, and I’ve asked for help.”  Still, he managed to use the word yet again and ultimately get himself fired from Grey's Anatomy. So it's no surprise that his guest appearance in season 10 was met with some controversy.  9 Katherine Heigl dissed the show's writing  This one is pretty darn unbelievable. After having won the Emmy award for supporting actress on Grey's Anatomy the year before, Katherine Heigl opted to remove her name from Emmy consideration in 2008. “I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization, I withdrew my name from contention,” she said in a statement. “In addition, I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials.”  Surprising? Maybe not so much. Shonda Rhimes later opened up about the incident, saying, ""On some level it stung, and on some level I was not surprised,"" and ""When people show you who they are, believe them.""  8 Why T.R. Knight left the show  Grey's Anatomy has became known for killing off beloved characters and ripping our hearts out, and that trend started with the character of George O'Malley, who was tragically hit by a bus at the end of season 5. The real reason George was so tragically killed off? Because T.R. Knight decided he was ready to quit the show altogether.  The actor was reportedly unhappy that he wasn't getting enough screen time. He also noted there was a ""breakdown of communication"" between himself and Shonda Rhimes, and he felt he no longer understood his character. Weirdly enough, George had enlisted in the military, which seemed like Rhimes' way of writing him off the show with an opening to return-- until he was brutally struck by a bus.  Knight actually made a recent return to Shondaland, though, appearing as Alice's brother, Tommy, on The Catch.  7 The cast reportedly resented Kate Walsh for getting her own spin off.  Fans of Kate Walsh's Addison Montgomery had to be thrilled about a spinoff revolving around the character, Private Practice. But the rest of the Grey's Anatomy cast? Yeah, not so much.  The cast was rumored to be resentful of Kate Walsh for getting her own spin off, and they reportedly all gave her the cold shoulder once they heard the news. According to a source, “The rest of the cast seemed instantly resentful of (Walsh)."" The source also stated that, “They each thought they’d be the one chosen to get their own show, and now they’re giving Kate the cold shoulder.” And reportedly, Ellen Pompeo “seemed particularly peeved because she felt that, as the star, she should have been consulted.”  6 Why Erica Hahn was abruptly written off  Erica Hahn's exit certainly didn't offer any closure. She walked off to her car at the end of a shift, and that was that. We never saw her again. And in real life, the exit was nearly as abrupt.  Brooke Smith she got the news that she was being let go, she was told the upcoming episode was her last. That was that. Smith said she got the feeling that it wasn't Rhimes' decision. It's also rumored that the network was uncomfortable with the explicit nature of Erica and Callie's relationship, though Rhimes later stated it wasn't that at all: ""Brooke Smith was obviously not fired for playing a lesbian. Clearly it’s not an issue as we have a lesbian character on the show – Calliope Torres. Sara Ramirez is an incredible comedic and dramatic actress and we wanted to be able to play up her magic. Unfortunately, we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke’s character would sustain in the long run.""  5 Shonda Rhimes: ""No Heigls""  Shonda Rhimes isn't someone you should mess around with. The showrunner has made it clear that after all the drama surrounding Grey's Anatomy, including the Emmys disaster involving Katherine Heigl, she's no longer going to tolerate anything of the sort.  When she was discussing her new show at the time, Scandal, starring Kerry Washington, Rhimes was very clear about her stance on on-set drama: “I don’t put up with bulls–t or nasty people. I don’t have time for it,"" she said. She also added, very specifically, ""There are no Heigls in this situation.""  It's also worth noting that Scandal main cast member Columbus Short (Harrison Wright) was let go from the show after drama in his personal life.  4 Fans started a petition to have Jesse Williams fired  After accepting BET's Humanitarian Award in 2016, Jesse Williams gave an impassioned and inspiring speech about racism in our nation. That speech went viral, and it was also met with quite a bit of controversy. In fact, it was met with so much controversy that some fans started a petition to have Williams fired from Grey's Anatomy.  The Change.org petition got 28,000 signatures, and stated that Williams' speech was ""a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people."" It also called for fans to boycott ABC. The petition was never going to go anywhere, though, and Shonda Rhimes was quick to let people know it. She offered a simple Tweet that summed everything up, saying, ""Um, people? Boo don't need a petition. #Shondalandrules""  3 Surgery on set is gross  Surgery on Grey's Anatomy is always difficult to watch, at least if you're a relatively squeamish person. Well, here's something to make it worse. Those surgeries are made to look realistic, and super gross, because of what's actually being used.  A few examples? The show has been known to use cow organs and lamb brains, for starters. And for blood matter, they use a mixture of blood, chicken fat, and... Jello.  Sarah Drew, who plays April Kepner on the show, has even spoken out about how disgusting it is to work those things on set. In an interview, she stated, ""We work with Bovine organs, which is cow’s organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag. And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There’s also a lot of silicone and blood matter – red jello mixed with blood and chicken fat. It’s pretty gross.""  2 Katherine Heigl wants to return, but Shonda Rhimes shut it down  If you're hoping for Izzy Stevens to return to Grey's Anatomy at some point, you might have to keep waiting. In 2012, long after Katherine Heigl left the series, she admitted she had made mistakes and that she'd like to be able to return Grey's Anatomy and wear her scrubs once again. However, Shonda Rhimes stated that wouldn't be happening any time soon.  Rhimes said in an interview, ""I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. We are on a track we have been planning, and the idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now.""  However, anything could happen. There's a reason Rhimes didn't kill Izzie off, and in a different interview, Rhimes noted that she could be open to seeing Izzie again.  1 Why Derek Was Killed Off  Of all the characters to be killed off on Grey's Anatomy, this one remains the most shocking and arguably the most heartbreaking. Who would have thought we'd see the day when Patrick Dempsey's Derek Shepherd was no longer a part of the series?  There's a lot of speculation as to why Dempsey left Grey's Anatomy, and Shonda Rhimes admitted to killing off at least one character because she didn't like the actor who played them. Now, she didn't admit to who, but considering the timing of that admission, along with multiple rumors, it's easy to assume she was referring to Patrick Dempsey in that statement.  Dempsey's response? He said he believes Shonda Rhimes ""loves being provocative and that's fine for who she is.""

Back in April Sienna Miller hit out at speculation she was enjoying a secret romance with Brad Pitt.  But two months later the rumour mill is churning again amid reports the two stars got cosy during a VIP party at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend.  Both Sienna and Brad were among the A-list contingent who descended on the UK's Somerset event for a weekend of music, but according to The Sun, the two also enjoyed each other's company.  A-list romance? Back in April Sienna Miller hit out at speculation she was enjoying a secret romance with Brad Pitt. But two months later the rumour mill is churning again amid reports the two stars got cosy during a VIP party at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend  According to the paper the stars were seen holding hands and stroking each other as they partied with mutual pals including Bradley Cooper and Noel Gallagher in the early hours of Saturday.  The report claims Sienna and Brad met up at 3am in the festival's Rabbit Hole area where onlookers spied them looking very cosy.  A source claims: 'Brad and Sienna couldn't keep their hands off each other, touching and stroking each other at every opportunity. They seemed really intimate.'  'Intimate': Both Sienna and Brad were among the A-list contingent who descended on the UK's Somerset event for a weekend of music  The insider added that Brad, who up until then was keeping a low profile at the world famous festival, looked delighted to meet up with Sienna, explaining:  'They seemed keen to get away from prying eyes and made a dash for the Rabbit Hole, the festival's underground and exclusive venue, with a group of friends and were inseparable as they waited to go inside.  'The party was cut short and they had to leave after five minutes because the venue was closing. Bradley Cooper left and Brad and Sienna headed back arm in arm to their private Winnebego.'  Party girl: Sienna headed to Glasto with her pals including Poppy Delevingne but according to a new report she met up with Brad in the early hours of Saturday  Another onlooker told Daily Star Online: 'Brad and Sienna were looking very cosy. I couldn't believe it - they were kissing in the VIP section of the Rabbit Hole.'  A representative for Brad declined to comment when approached by MailOnline. Sienna's representatives have also been contacted.  Back in April Sienna lashed out at 'silly' reports claiming she was spotted flirting with Brad, who is in the midst of divorcing Angelina Jolie.  The 35-year-old Brit insisted she would not 'dignify it with a response', in an interview with the New York Post just days after Page Six claimed the duo enjoyed a dinner date in Los Angeles.  Bachelor life: Brad has been enjoying single life as he attended Glastonbury with pals including Bradley Cooper  Music fan: Brad was seen checking out the weekend's acts side of stage on Friday  Having previously dated her Alfie co-star Jude Law and and enjoyed a 'brief' encounter with Layer Cake's Daniel Craig, she conceded that the Brad reports were 'predictable', as his production company is behind her new movie The Lost City of Z.  Page Six reported that Sienna and Brad were reportedly seen getting flirty in LA, after which they attended the premiere of The Lost City Z separately but insiders claim at a dinner after the screening the pair got close.  Brad, whose company Plan B is behind the film, was said to be doing some 'serious flirting' while surrounded by about 25 people. A source told Page Six: 'They were heavily enjoying each other's company and 'they were talking to each other all night.'  Rendezvous: The report claims Sienna met up with Brad at 3am in the festival's Rabbit Hole area where onlookers spied them looking very cosy  It was claimed that soon to be divorced Brad seemed to perk up after the interaction with Sienna as he was 'in very high spirits, which he hasn't been for a long time. He seems to be over a hump'.  Shortly after the reports emerged, Sienna spoke to The New York Post, where she vehemently denied the reports - insisting she would not entertain the prospect. She said: 'I'm not going to even dignify it with a response. It's predictable and silly'.  Prior to her denial, another source close to Sienna downplayed the possible flirtation and said the pair were part of a larger group so there were a lot of conversations going on throughout the night.  Party people; Sienna, a new recruit to Instagram, shared a snap of her swish ride to the festival on Friday with her pals  Back when the movie was filming, Sienna was forced to deny that there was another going on with a then-very married Brad.  She called a suggestion they were flirting 'insane' on Sway In The Morning on SiriusXM's Shade 45. The star said: 'The brilliant thing about that rumor is that yeah I haven't really read too much about it.  'So this is the truth about that, Brad Pitt is producing the movie that I just wrapped but I didn't see him, he's not been to the set. You know he's the producer of the film and I've met him twice - it's insane.'  Meanwhile according to New Idea, Elle Macpherson has also been spotted cosying up to actor Brad during a recent rendezvous in Hollywood.  Another rumour: Meanwhile according to New Idea, Elle Macpherson has also been spotted cosying up to actor Brad during a recent rendezvous in Hollywood  'They definitely seemed cosy together, like a couple on an intimate date,' the publication's source claimed on Monday.  'She was touching his arm a lot and flicking her hair over her shoulder,' the onlooker said of the 53-year-old supermodel, adding: 'There was a lot of flirting going on.'  It appears Brad, 53, also enjoyed the Australian bombshell's company during their meeting at the LA nightclub.  'He was laughing at everything she said and leaning in really close,' the source claimed.  The pair first met on the set of Friends in 1999, while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, who also starred on the sitcom.  Reports of the genetically-blessed pair's meet-up comes just weeks after Elle supposedly split from billionaire property developer Jeffrey Soffer.  The mother-of-two and her sons Flynn, 19, and Aurelius, 14, are said to have moved out of the Miami mansion they previously shared with the 44-year-old billionaire.	1
Selma Blair has returned former co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar’s compliment by admitting their onscreen smooch ranks as her favourite.  The two actresses shared a passionate lesbian kiss in a famous scene from 1999 teen movie Cruel Intentions - a contemporary adaptation of the 1782 novel by French author Pierre Choderlos de Laclos.

She also mentioned the pair still keep in touch, adding that the 42-year-old raven-haired actress is 'up for a good time' and is a 'fun, good girl.'

Friends: The duo re-enacted a downplayed version of the kiss when they won the MTV Movie Award for best kiss in 2000  During the ceremony Sarah thanked Selma for her 'most rewarding kiss on-screen ever.'  Funnily enough the Buffy the Vampire Slayer actress was also meant to have another same sex smooch in the family friendly movie Scooby-Doo.  The 2002 film was originally meant to be raunchier and included a scene were Daphne, played by Sarah, kisses Velma, portrayed by Linda Cardellini.  However once the film steered into a more 'wholesome' direction the scene was cut and never released.  Couple: Sarah shared a kiss with husband Freddie Prinze Jr. in the 2002 flick Scooby-Doo  In the same movie Sarah locked lips with 38-year-old husband Freddie, but it looks like that kiss couldn't compare with Selma's.  The American-born personality also shared multiple pecks with fellow Buffy star and heartthrob David Boreanaz during the supernatural shows lengthy run.  She also performed romantically alongside Ryan Phillippe in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Alec Baldwin in Suburban Girl.  Sarah is currently in Australia as a judge and ambassador for the 2014 Spectacle Wearer Of The Year competition presented by Specsavers.  She tied the knot with Freddie in 2002 and the pair have two children together, a son and daughter.	0
Although Rihanna and Hassan Jameel just spent Grammys night together, they’re working through some things from her past. He is feeling ‘tense’ over her ex, Chris Brown!  Despite keeping their relationship super private, Rihanna, 29, and Hassan Jameel, stepped out on Grammys night, proving they’re still going strong. However, Hassan — a billionaire businessman and Toyota heir — is stressing over RiRi’s ex, Chris Brown, 28. “He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past,” a source close to Rihanna tells HollywoodLife.com. As previously reported, Chris has been keeping a close eye on his ex and her new man, as he’s been known to have lingering feelings from their past romance. With that being said, “Hassan doesn’t trust Chris and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.”  Although the insider says Rihanna has opened up to Hassan about her relationship with Chris and assured him that that’s all part of her past, Hassan isn’t entirely convinced. “He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy,” the source admits. “Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.”  Rihanna and Hassan have yet to confirm their relationship since they were first romantically linked in June 2017. The pair were photographed in each other’s arms amidst a make-out session at a private villa in Spain. However, both RiRi and Hassan have kept things under wraps, only stepping out separately and never being photographed in the same shot. The two were spotted dining at the same London restaurant in September 2017, and then they travel to Boston in October of that year.  The rumored new couple attended hit the same Grammy afterparty at 1Oak Nightclub in New York City on Sunday, where they were photographed leaving separately. But, RiRi excited the club shortly after Hassan had left.  Hassan’s worries over Chris come at the same time reports claim the singer is dating Indonesian singer/songwriter, Agnez Mo. Chris and Mo have been fueling the romance rumors, posting flirty photos together and stepped out together. They were most recently spotted holding hands during a Disneyland date over the January 6/7 weekend.  HollywoodLifers, who would you like to see Rihanna date?	1

Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani weren’t always so sure their romance was built to stand the test of time.  During a preview of the singer’s upcoming Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist interview, Shelton, 42, admitted that both he and Stefani, 48, initially thought their relationship was strictly a “rebound.”  “When I was going through my divorce, I hit rock bottom, just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,” Shelton told Geist. “It’s a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time.”  Continuing, he added, “If Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought, ‘This is a rebound deal.’”  Shelton and Stefani met as coaches on The Voice and started dating in 2015, not long after Shelton’s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani’s divorce from Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani John Shearer/ACMA2018/Getty  RELATED: Gwen Stefani Joins Blake Shelton Onstage as He Jokes About ‘Messin’ Around’ When They First Met  Shelton went on to say that neither of them were sure things would become serious, because they were both “coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives” and were “kind of clinging to each other to get through this.”  “But now here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it’s going to the next level,” he remarked.  The country singer previously hinted at their not-so-serious origins in September 2017, when he was joined by Stefani for an intimate concert at his Ole Red Tishomingo venue in Oklahoma.  While jokingly discussing their relationship, Shelton explained they “started hanging out together and messing around.”  After Stefani — who had brought along her three sons — appeared surprised by his admission, he added, “you know, texting each other.”  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton REX/Shutterstock  The former No Doubt frontwoman also addressed the beginning of their romance on her 2016 album This Is What the Truth Feels Like.  On “Truth,” she sings, “And they’re all gonna say I’m rebounding, so rebound all over me.”  RELATED VIDEO: Gwen Stefani and Her Kids Spend Spring Break in Blake Shelton’s Native State of Oklahoma  While discussing what the future holds for the pair, Shelton admitted to CMT’s Cody Alan that while he is contemplating marriage, fans shouldn’t be waiting on pins and needles for an engagement announcement.  “I think about it. I don’t think it’s anytime soon or anything,” Shelton said when asked about walking down the aisle. “The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you’d be getting to that.”  See Shelton’s full interview Sunday, June 24th on Sunday TODAY.	1

All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.	0
Jackie gets political and the two Beckys unite in newly released photos from ABC’s Roseanne revival.  All told, the network has released nearly a dozen pics from Season 10 (premiering Tuesday, March 27 at 8/7c; watch teaser), including our first glimpse of Lecy Goranson and her successor Sarah Chalke in a shared scene.

Brad Pitt reportedly couldn't resist canoodling with Jennifer Aniston in a restaurant, causing even more concern for her allegedly troubled marriage to Justin Theroux.  After Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, Twitter found entertainment in imagining Jennifer Aniston’s glee. Jolie had reportedly been at least partly responsible for causing Jennifer and Brad’s split, leading some to speculate that Aniston felt gleeful over the crumbling of Pitt’s second marriage.  In recent months, however, the relationship between Jennifer and Brad reportedly has changed. Even though Aniston is now married to Justin Theroux, Jennifer allegedly just “can’t let go” of Pitt, and it’s rumored to be destroying her romance with Justin, as the Inquisitr reported. Now, Jennifer and Brad have gone from a platonic reunion to a rekindled romance, according to a new report.  Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston: “Always In Love”  Yahoo quoted an insider’s claim that Brad and Jennifer have “always been in love.” Recalling the era when Pitt and Aniston were Hollywood’s golden couple, the source said that Jennifer and Brad have continued to have feelings for each other despite her marriage to Justin Theroux and his marriage to Angelina Jolie.  “They were once the golden couple of Hollywood and apparently Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston still hold a soft spot in their hearts for one another.”  Quoting Woman’s Day magazine, Yahoo reported that Pitt and Aniston recently just happened to encounter each other in Los Angeles during Jennifer’s dinner date. Aniston was with friends at Soho House. During her meal, Brad showed up and joined the group, according to the insider.  Brad Pitt Caught Canoodling With Jennifer Aniston  Even though Aniston and Pitt were in a public restaurant, Brad apparently could not resist the temptation, an observer told the publication.  “Brad kissed Jen’s neck and whispered something into her ear before giving her a knowing glance.”  One insider, the former security guard to Pitt, revealed even more about Brad’s rumored feelings for Jennifer. Kris Herzog told the magazine that even though Pitt was married to Angelina Jolie and Aniston is still married to Justin Theroux, the former lovebirds never lost their love for each other.  Jennifer Aniston’s marriage to Justin Theroux reportedly is troubled amid her renewed romance with Brad Pitt. Francois Mori / AP Images  “Brad and Jen are in love and always have been,” declared Kris.  Moreover, Herzog claimed that Pitt and Aniston have been spending a lot of time together in the wake of Angelina filing for divorce in 2016.  Brad Pitt Not Totally To Blame For Jennifer Aniston’s Allegedly Troubled Marriage  Jolie and Brad famously met on the movie set of Mr. And Mrs. Smith during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer and Brad were married for five years before splitting in 2005. Aniston dated Justin Theroux for four years prior to tying the knot in in 2015.  In contrast, Pitt and Jolie were together for 11 years, although they were married for only two years. They are currently co-parenting six children, ranging in age from 16-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, and 13-year-old Zahara to 11-year-old Shiloh Jolie-Pitt and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  Brad and Angelina’s divorce has earned extensive publicity, including the battle for custody of the kids. But rumors that Pitt’s renewed romance with Aniston has hurt her marriage to Justin Theroux have remained unconfirmed. People Magazine pointed out that the rumors are linked to the seemingly separate lives that Jennifer and Justin live.  “Despite tabloid claims of trouble due to their frequent distance, Aniston and Theroux’s two-year marriage is solid, [some insiders insist].”  Jennifer and Justin both have busy lives because of their careers, which often force them to work long distances apart. But even though Aniston and Theroux appear to be separated, one of the insiders said that Jennifer and Justin “have figured out a life that works for them.”  As for how Aniston’s rumored rekindled romance with Brad has affected her relationship with Theroux, Pitt isn’t getting all of the blame for any problems. According to the Hollywood Gossip, Jennifer’s marriage to Justin was in trouble even before her alleged reunion with Brad. An insider quoted by the publication said that Aniston’s and Theroux’s relationship “has been crumbling,” and Pitt’s ability to console Jennifer while she’s vulnerable reportedly has made her marriage to Justin even more troubled.	1
Is there something romantic going on between Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller? A new report claims now that they’re both single, ‘the door is open’ for them to take things to the next level.  Is there a new celebrity romance brewing? A new report from OK! is claiming that things might start heating up between Robert Pattinson, 32, and Sienna Miller, 36. The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.  As for the pair’s friends, they reportedly think that these two would work really well together. “All of their mutual friends think Rob and Sienna would be a good match,” the insider said. Rob and Sienna have always seemed pretty close. While promoting their film, The Lost City Of Z at the Berlin International Film Festival in Feb. 2017, the pair looked comfortable together while posing for photos and grabbing dinner together.  This would definitely be an interesting match though considering Sienna is the one who set the Twilight star up with his ex-fiancée FKA twigs. A source told E! News in 2014 that Rob, Sienna and her now ex-fiancé Tom Sturridge all went to the singer’s concert together. The Remember Me actor ended up falling in love with Twigs’ music, and the couple introduced the two of them.  HollywoodLife reached out to Rob and Sienna’s reps for comment.	1

"Taylor Swift's sexual assault trial against former radio DJ David Mueller will begin its third day in Denver today. Mueller is suing Swift because he was fired from his radio co-host job in 2013 after she claimed he lifted her skirt and grabbed her butt while they posed for a photo at a meet and greet during her Denver Red Tour concert. Swift filed a countersuit a month later for sexual assault and battery.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  According to Gossip Cop and the Associated Press, Mueller is seeking $3 million in damages from Swift, while Swift is seeking just $1 in her suit (in addition to reimbursement for attorneys fees and costs in defending the suit, according to pre-trial documents per The Denver Post). ""She's not trying to bankrupt this man,"" her attorney J. Doug Baldridge said in his opening statement yesterday (via Denver ABC 7's live case blog). ""She's just trying to tell people out there that you can say no when someone puts their hand on you. Grabbing a woman's rear end is an assault, and it's always wrong. Any woman—rich, poor, famous, or not—is entitled to have that not happen.""  Gossip Cop also reported that if Swift is awarded any additional damages, she said she will donate the money to a women's rights charity.  The Mueller v. Swift trial—which is before a judge and 8-member jury (6 women, 2 men selected)—is expected to last for nine days total. Swift is expected to testify."	1
"In Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot found the role model she'd always wanted to play.  The DC superhero movie star was presented the second ever #SeeHer Award at the Critics' Choice Awards on Thursday, which honors more accurate portrayals of women in film. Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins presented Gadot with the award, who went on to address Time's Up and the current movement of women speaking out with their stories of sexual harassment and called for more women leading films -- and in the director's chair.  ""Throughout my career, I was asked to describe my dream role, and it was clear to me that I wanted to play a strong and independent woman. A real one,"" the Israeli actress shared. ""When I started acting, there were very few female-led movies and even fewer female directors.""  ""In the past weeks and months, we've been witnessing a movement within our industry and society,"" Gadot continued. ""We will band together to make strides, uniting for equality.""  Gadot follows in the footsteps of Viola Davis, who won the first award at last year's show.  Watch the video below for more of what Gadot has said about the Time's Up initiative.

The newly wedded Duchess of Sussex Meghan has joined Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II at a series of events as she launched into life as a full-time royal.  ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle’s dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.  According to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.  It comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is “terrified” of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, “crossed the line” with his comments that Princess Diana would have “loathed” how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.  The Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.  Sources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.  The first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.  A final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.  Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.  The Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan’s saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.  “There’s no chance right now - he’s been a complete embarrassment,” the source said.  MORE: Thomas Markle speaks about former drug use.  MORE: Meghan’s kids will have surprising surname  The Palace crisis talks come just days after the Duchess’ dad confessed to taking drugs while his daughter Meghan was growing up.  Meghan’s outspoken father made the startling admission as he angrily denied having a drinking problem.  He said: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years” while claiming he only has wine with dinner.  Mr Markle insisted that he doesn’t even drink beer despite being photographed with a six pack.  He said: “I regularly buy a six-pack for the guys on the guard gate because they’re stuck in a hot shack for hours each day and could use a cold one.”  A source close to the family added that Mr Markle used drugs to cope with the pressures of Hollywood while working as a lighting director.  They said that drug use was “part and parcel” of working in television where the hours were long.  While Mr Markle did not specify which drugs he used to take, his daughter Samantha said that marijuana was popular among his peers at the time.

Postby Guest » Sat Jul 07, 2018 5:10 am  Brad Pitt is on the verge of relapsing because Neri Oxman dumped him, according to a completely wrong tabloid story. Gossip Cop can debunk this report. Pitt is committed to his sobriety, and was never dating Oxman in the first place.    But the Globe wants readers to believe Pitt has “suffered a painful blow to the heart” after Oxman “jilted him for a billionaire.” The magazine contends that “friends” now “fear losing at love will send” the actor into a “destructive abuse binge.” The narrative was sparked by Oxman being seen with her boyfriend, Bill Ackman, in Paris last month.    “Brad still thought things would work out with Neri. So it was a shock when he saw she’s back with Bill,” a so-called “source” is quoted as saying. Maintains the outlet, “Now sources worry the Allied star could fall off the wagon… Insiders worry the stress of romantic disappointment and his custody war [with Angelina Jolie] could trigger an issue.” Of course, none of these untraceable “sources” or “insiders” are named.    Gossip Cop can’t help but wonder if they’re the same ones that led this publication to falsely allege last month that Pitt and Jolie were “calling off” their divorce. The tabloid even went as far as claiming they were “hot again” after a “steamy, clothes-ripping reconciliation,” and that they’d have a “second commitment ceremony.” Notably, nothing is said about any of that in this new tale about Pitt’s supposed heartbreak from Oxman.    The stories aren’t just inconsistent; they’re also plain wrong. Just as Pitt was never getting back together with Jolie in June, he was never romantically involved with Oxman. As Page Six rightly reported back in April, Pitt and the MIT professor have shared a friendship and nothing more.    Confirms his spokesperson to Gossip Cop, “They were only friends.” And Oxman was dating Ackman all along. So the premise that Pitt has been “jilted” is entirely untrue. As for his love life affecting his well-being, “Entertainment Tonight” reported just last week that Pitt has chosen to focus on fatherhood, not dating. It was specifically noted, “He spent over a year learning to live a healthier lifestyle and he feels better than ever.”    Conclusion: After wrongly claiming Pitt reunited with Jolie in June, the tabloid is now contending in July that he’s been dumped by Oxman. But according to other outlets and Pitt’s own rep, he and the scholar were never dating. That means this article is based on a false premise. Additionally, while the magazine asserts there’s concerns Pitt is on the verge of a relapse, it was just reliably reported last week that he is feeling “better than ever” and has embraced a “healthier lifestyle.” It’s apparent this story is entirely inaccurate.	1

Her older sister and brother-in-law, Prince William, left Kensington Palace and headed to Englefield late Saturday morning together in a car with William behind the wheel. The mother of two was spotted donning a fascinator atop her head, a signature accessory for the British fashionista.	0
"Eminem was one of the big names performing at Coachella. (Photo: Zoe Meyers, The Desert Sun-USA TODAY NETWORK)  A series of deafening blasts during Eminem's Bonnaroo set Saturday night prompted several festival goers to criticize the hip hop artist for what they described as ""gunshot"" sound effects.  Shortly after starting his headlining set on the What Stage, three separate blasts rang out during his performance sparking debate on social media over whether such sound effects are appropriate in the context of recent mass shootings.

Coachella is here and the festival may have brought along with the flower crowns and the good music some romance as well.  Some of Hollywood’s greatest names took Coachella by storm and on the first day of the event, some of them sparked dating rumors as well.  Chris Pine and Star Trek Beyond co-star Sofia Boutella were spotted heading to the NYLON Midnight Garden Party alongside Troian Bellisario and Patrick J. Adams.  According to an insider, Chris and Sofia had a great time in each other’s company and were together the whole night. The two reportedly arrived sometime around midnight and stayed at the party for about an hour and a half.  “They were super cute. Chris kept stepping back to let her have the spotlight and wouldn’t take photos but kept watching her when she would pose,” the eyewitness stated. “They were together the entire time and kept walking with his hand around her waist.”  Aww… Can we smell love in the air?  Furthermore, it looks like their buddies also encouraged them to interact and were there to make sure everybody was having fun.  “Troian was so cute. She kept pushing Sofia to do photos and checking in on her,” the insider shared. “You can tell they were all really good friends and having a great double date.”  We should mention first before the speculations go out of control, that Chris and Sofia have been great friends for a while but indeed, their relationship has always had the potential for more.  Sofia took to Instagram to gush over Chris’ acting skills and promoted his movie, saying that he is a “special human” and very dear to her and a very talented actor as well, of course.  Other stars spotted at the party include Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, Nicole Richie, Scott Eastwood and Hailee Steinfeld.

Leonardo DiCaprio was seen kissing his 20-year-old girlfriend, Camila Morrone, at the Eminem show during Coachella.  The Oscar winning actor, Leo, is famous for dating younger models. And this time it was none other than Morrone, the step-daughter of Hollywood acting legend Al Pacino.  Daughter of actors Maximo Morrone and Lucile Sola, Morrone, has been romantically linked to DiCaprio for several months now. Rumors of the two being together first started in the middle of December, when DiCaprio was seen leaving her house. They have been spotted together numerous times ever since.  Sola, 38, has been dating 77-year-old Al Pacino for over 8 years, making him Morrone’s de facto stepfather.  DiCaprio and Morrone were seen enjoying the show at Coachella together. While Morrone was dressed normally, the Titanic actor attempted to be incognito by wearing a large hoodie and baseball cap. The two cuddled and kissed throughout the show.  Afterwards, they lounged on the grass outside a tent… with DiCaprio eating while Morrone was lying down with her head in his lap.  The pair were also seen at the Neon Carnival and Rihanna’s FentyxPuma party. Before Coachella, they were last seen together in late March at breakfast in West Hollywood. In February, the two were spotted at Ellen Degeneres’ birthday party in LA together. And in January, the couple went to Colorado together with Tobey Maguire.  Morrone has worked as a model, appearing on the cover of Vogue Turkey and walking for Moschino’s 2017 resort collection. She is now working her way into acting. She appeared in James Franco’s Bukowski and in Death Wish, starring Bruce Willis.  Leonardo has been known to exclusively date younger women (usually supermodels) in the past: Kristen Zang, Amber Valletta, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, Gisele Bundchen, Bar Rafaeli, Blake Lively and Erin Heatherton are just some of the names in Leo’s little black book.	1
"Kim Kardashian is NOT upset about Kanye West working on a cosmetics line, despite a seemingly fabricated report. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust the story.  ""Kim Kardashian Worried Kanye West Is Working Too Hard With New Cosmetics Line,"" HollywoodLife announces in a purported ""exclusive."" It says in the accompanying story, ""Uh oh! Workaholic Kanye West has grand plans to launch a new cosmetics line, but it has wife Kim Kardashian terrified he's stretching himself too thin.""  The site asserts, ""Coming just a few months after his breakdown that led to an eight-day psychiatric hospitalization, his wife Kim Kardashian is scared about what taking on all this extra work could do to his mental healing."" A so-called ""source"" is quoted as telling the webloid, ""Kanye's grand plans for business have Kim worried for Kanye's health. Things have been good between Kim and Kanye lately and she admires his ambition, but his latest venture in cosmetics has Kim worried for her husband's health.""  Yes, that repetitious quote sounds entirely natural. This (quite possibly fictional) ""source"" continues, ""She does not want Kanye over-worked or stressed over business deals or involved in anything that could affect his sensitive health situation."" Adds the (quite possibly invented) tipster, ""Kim wants Kanye to spend more time with her and the children and less time starting new businesses.""  Here's what's going on: TMZ recently reported that West wanted to trademark ""Donda,"" his late mother's name, for a cosmetics line. Hours later, HollywoodLies magically managed to have ""exclusive"" information all about it, including Kardashian's supposed reaction to his plans. But Gossip Cop has repeatedly been told that the disreputable outlet doesn't have real sources when it comes to the couple.  In fact, after HollywoodLife made up stories about Kardashian's robbery, we learned that the weloid doesn't even bother to fact-check its ""exclusives"" with the reality star's camp, instead choosing to publish unverified ""fabrication[s]."" And that appears to be what's happened here. A rep for Kardashian exclusively tells Gossip Cop the allegation she's upset with West is ""false."""	1
"If you're rooting for John Cena and Nikki Bella to get back together, then it sounds like a certain WWE Superstar is right there with you. When John Cena opened up about his and Nikki Bella's breakup on the Monday, May 14 episode of TODAY, he told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford that he still loves his ex-fiancée.  The Blockers star said,  “It’s been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it’s very difficult. I had my heart broken out of nowhere — or, for me, it was out of nowhere — and anyone who's experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings. I’ve looked at myself every day, and I’ve tried to evaluate myself every day, and the woman I love. For anyone out there speculating on what I’m doing with my life now: I still love Nicole. I would still love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole.”  That ""I still would love to have a family with Nicole"" line should throw Total Bellas and Total Divas fans for a loop. Cena has been adamant about not wanting kids for years, while Bella has made it pretty clear that she’d like to settle down and start a family. This point of contention came up over and over again on both E! reality shows, and the WWE power couple never seemed to get to the same page. Many speculate that this failure to see eye to eye might've fueled their breakup. But now they may finally be on the same page about kids but also broken up? Oof, how's that for crummy timing.  TODAY on YouTube  Cena and Bella began dating in 2012, and as Total Divas and Total Bellas fans know all too well, the topics of marriage and children were recurring issues in their relationship. Bella hoped to wed and have kids with Cena, whereas Cena wasn't on board with either. But then, Cena apparently changed his mind on the whole marriage thing and proposed to Bella at WrestleMania in 2017. Their wedding was scheduled for May 5, but the pair announced their breakup on April 15.  Cena told Kotb and Gifford that he is neither happy about being single nor interested in being in a relationship with anyone other than Bella. He said,  “I don’t want anybody else. I love Nicole. And I’m really trying to support her in her trying to find whatever it is that she wants that made this fall apart in the first place … I don’t have any other hopes, other than maybe one day, we can work it out.”  Meanwhile, Bella spent Monday morning at the NBCUniversal upfronts. She did not see Cena's latest TODAY appearance, but she heard all about it when Extra filled her in during the upfronts red carpet. After hearing that Cena said he wanted to be with her and start a family with her, Bella replied, ""Wow, I'm speechless."" But is it a good speechless, bad speechless, or a ""we're totally getting back together please don't spoil anything"" speechless?  E! Entertainment on YouTube  When E! News chatted with her at the upfronts, the WWE Superstar said that watching her and Cena's relationship unravel on the upcoming season of Total Bellas will “be definitely very hard to relive,” but she did not want to cut it from the show. She told E! News, ""I feel like I would be cheating [the viewers] if I was to take away all that footage because it's real life.""  Bella added,  “I’ve already seen some of the episodes and I’m watching myself and I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’ I think a lot of people are going to be able to relate to it and it’s also going to give a lot of people courage and bravery to speak up. I think sometimes we go through things because we’re like, ‘OK, this is what we need to do. It’s too late.’ It’s never too late to make a decision, so. Yeah.”  But does this mean she's done with with Cena for good? Maybe not.  E! Live from the Red Carpet on YouTube  Like Cena, Bella seems relatively open to possibly getting back together at some point down the line. She told E! News,  “John is the love of my life. He’s absolutely an amazing man. I’m so lucky to have these amazing six years with him. There’s some of us that we hope that in the end it can work out. I just think the most important part is you want to make sure live the rest of your life happy. You don’t want people to force things or have to change themselves so much. And so those are the things we’re just stepping away and seeing what we both really want out of life, and when we come back together will it make us happy for the rest of our life? We both don’t want to live in regret. So we’re being very mature, which is great … So we’ll see.”  And the gossip magazines sure think a reunion may very well be in the tea leaves. Last Tuesday, Us Weekly reported that a source claimed Bella has been “spending nights” with Cena at his place. And last Monday, a source claimed to People that the WWE Superstars are “on a path to reconciliation.”  Keep those ""You can't see me"" fingers crossed for Cena and Bella to do whatever makes both of them happy for the rest of their lives."	0
A shocking new report claims Kourtney Kardashian’s pregnant again — and they have a theory as to who the father may be! Is it her ex, Younes Bendjima?    Here’s another plot twist in Kourtney Kardashian’s love life. The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with “what appeared to be a bump” in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! “It was strange to see because she’s usually so perfectly svelte,” a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, “Everyone is whispering that she’s pregnant with her fourth child.” If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it’s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney’s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney’s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim — it’s more than likely Scott!  “They’ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,” the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 – but reportedly, that was not on Scott’s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a “recent” trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! “They made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,” the source said before adding, “Everyone is buzzing that she’s carrying Scott’s baby.” As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven’t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn’t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because “all of their kids came out beautifully.”  And apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren’t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney’s alleged baby bump wasn’t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone’s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly “isn’t sure how to handle this situation.” The friend added that Kourtney “isn’t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she’s been spending time with…it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner’s] management skills to straighten out this mess!”  Maybe this report isn’t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum – it’s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? “[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,” our source told us. “So if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.”  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima’s and Scott Disick’s reps for a comment.	1

Ivanka Trump is getting some extra notice lately.  Well, more accurately, Trump's eyes are getting some extra notice lately.  As she makes more and more public appearances in her new official role in the White House, people are looking closely and realizing Trump's eyes may not be what they appear.  REUTERS  As it turns out, if you stare deeply into Trump's eyes, you'll notice they change repeatedly over time.  At various different public appearances, Trump's eyes are different colors. Naturally, her eyes -- like her hair -- are brown.  REUTERS  But sometimes, she changes it up. Her eyes have appeared a lighter hazel, green and even blue at various points over time, including during the 2016 presidential election.  Check out the changes for yourself:  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  As you can see, Trump's eyes are a revolution over time.  There doesn't appear to be an exact method to the eye-color-changing madness.  Her eyes were brown when she stared at Justin Trudeau.  REUTERS  But they were green when she had a controversial interview with Gayle King on CBS.  This eye color phenomenon has been noticed at least as far back as early November, when Esquire questioned Trump's eye color.  Then, press representatives did not respond to Esquire's request for comment on if she wears color-changing contacts, so we just have to go off common sense and say that's what's happening (it's more likely than her eyes spontaneously changing color on opposite sides of the genetic spectrum).  Although some women have said their eyes changed colors over the course of pregnancy -- and Trump was pregnant last year -- that doesn't explain why the color hopped around so much.  Maybe she likes the way it looks and it gives her confidence. Maybe she wants to give off a lighter tone to be more likable (see: all the Disney characters with blue eyes), which, yeah, is a racial thing.  And if you really want to go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole (and I know you do), you could consider the implications of making oneself blonde and blue-eyed. Like what Nazis like.  As this news continues to be reported, many people are wondering why.  Twitter  Twitter  There is certainly a lot going on in the Trump world. But you clicked here, didn't you?

Aaron Carter is speaking out about his DUI arrest over the weekend – lashing out at police and even his brother Nick.  The former child star, 29, was pulled over about 9 p.m. Saturday in Habersham County, Georgia, about 90 miles north of Atlanta. He was charged with driving under the influence, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana and possession of drug-related objects.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the car with him and was also arrested, PEOPLE confirms. She was charged with possession of marijuana, obstruction of law enforcement officers and possession of drug-related objects, according to the sheriff’s office.  Backstreet Boy Nick Carter shared a message to his younger brother on Twitter following news of the incident.  “To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better,” Nick, 37, wrote. “Family isn’t always easy, [but] we’re all here for you.”  Habersham County Sheriff's Office via AP  In a public statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, Aaron made it clear that he didn’t think his brother went about the situation in the right away.  “If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum?” he said in the statement. “That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down. I love my family despite it through thick and thin.”  Nick seemingly responded to the message by retweeting a post by Nick’s wife, Lauren, which read, “Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!”  Aaron’s rep Jonathan Ward tells PEOPLE the popstar is reachable by his family — “whom he loves” — at any time.  “Nick and Lauren have his number – it hasn’t changed. They last spoke on July 6,” Ward tells PEOPLE exclusively. “He doesn’t feel it was proper, what happened. You don’t reach out through Twitter.”  To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better. — Nick Carter (@nickcarter) July 16, 2017  Family isn't always easy,be we're all here for you. — Nick Carter (@nickcarter) July 16, 2017  Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again! 🤳🏼🗣👀 — Lauren Kitt Carter (@Lauren_Kitt) July 17, 2017  Aaron Carter also professed his innocence of all charges – and claimed he was targeted by police because he was famous.  According to the statement, Carter said he was at an AutoZone in Georgia to fix a tire that was out of alignment on his car when police officers arrested him “with aggression.”  He added that he has a license for medical marijuana for his anxiety and feels he was marked due to his fame.  “He feels his ‘celebrity’ was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter,” the statement said. “The video from AutoZone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.”  Medical marijuana is legal in Georgia with a license. However, anxiety is not one of the 14 specific conditions covered.  Allen Berezovsky/Getty Image  The singer was previously arrested for investigation of marijuana possession in 2008.  Carter has previously said he “smokes bud,” but denied drinking or doing any other drugs.  During a candid interview for an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? last year, Aaron admitted that he turned to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate for depression he experienced after his parents’ divorce and his time on Dancing with the Stars.  “I started getting really heavy into drinking and was telling people, ‘I’m on a real bad path right now. I need help,’ ” he explained.  In 2011, Aaron checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California “to heal some emotional and spiritual issues he was dealing with,” his manager at the time, Johnny Wright, previously said in a statement.  Aaron has been in the spotlight since recording his first album at age seven. He was just 12 when his song “Aaron’s Party (Come Get It)” dropped. It went triple platinum and made him an international sensation.	0
Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez is on video admitting to not only bullying and ostracizing the Parkland shooter, but that she was justified in doing so.

Again, bullying doesn’t excuse or justify shooting up a school. Okay? Okay. But I think less bullying of students is certainly better than “We bullied him and he deserved it.” Fair?People are responsible for their actions. The tools are not.	1
athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she’s constantly finding ways to lose them with her inability to act decently in public and her outrageous attempts to place herself in the spotlight.She’s in the spotlight again, but it’s not the type of spotlight a celebrity should want to be in since this doesn’t seem to be a way to gain new fans.After her generic low-brow comments, some people might jokingly question if Kathy Griffin is a man.

Kevin Spacey has issued an official statement in response to allegations made by actor Anthony Rapp, who told BuzzFeed News that Spacey made a drunken sexual advance on him when he was just 14 years old. Spacey, who claimed not to remember the incident, said that if he did do what Rapp has alleged, then he owes him the “sincerest apology” for his “inappropriate” behavior. Rapp described Spacey climbing on top of him on a bed at a party in 1986 before he was ultimately able to get away and leave the room. Spacey also took the opportunity to address the rumors about his sexuality, revealing for the first time publicly that he “chooses” to “live as a gay man.” In a 2010 interview with The Daily Beast, Spacey declined to specify his sexual orientation, saying, “No one’s personal life is in the public interest. It’s gossip, bottom line.”	0
Doctor Who will introduce its first-ever female Time Lord Doctor, played by Jodie Whittaker, this fall — but the character won’t change too much.  “It’s the Doctor you’ve known and loved, with just a fresh take,” new showrunner Chris Chibnall said at the show’s San Diego Comic-Con panel on Thursday. “The Doctor is still very much The Doctor. But we need a pillar of hope, and that pillar of hope is Jodie Whittaker.”  The actress won over the producers from the instant she walked into the audition room. “It’s one of those things [where] you don’t know what you’re looking for until you see it,” Chibnall described, hailing Whittaker’s performance as “fresh, funny and very emotional.”  As for how Whittaker’s Broadchurch co-star and former Doctor David Tennant reacted to her casting, the actress said the message conveyed to her was, “This is the most amazing thing that can happen to you, and there are only a few people who know how it feels.”  While Season 11 won’t debut until this fall, fans were already introduced to the 13th Doctor in last year’s Christmas special. Shooting the brief scene was “incredibly nerve-wrecking, because the reveal had [already] happened [in the media],” Whittaker described. “You have no idea what you’re taking on… I was nervous to touch anything. I felt as if I was in someone else’s shoes, which is a wonderful way to start this journey. It was amazing.”  The cast and creative team were tight-lipped on specifics about the new Time Lord, but executive producer Matt Strevens did share that “this Doctor is in love with life” and “treats everything with respect and wonder.”  Whittaker will be joined by three new companions, who are all very different, said Mandip Gill (Hollyoaks), who plays one of the pals. Her character, Yasmin, is a 19-year-old who is “whisked away on this amazing adventure with these people, who become her family, and she’s in awe of the Doctor… The dynamic between the three friends is beautiful.”  When it came time to cast the companions, “we were looking for people who have incredible range, because the tone of the show demands everything,” Chibnall described. “And just truth — bringing emotional truth. It’s really important for us this season, especially. There are big emotional journeys for everyone to go on. All of them aced it, and the chemistry was really apparent.”  In addition to its new ensemble, Season 11 will also feature a fresh take on the sonic screwdriver. Chibnall would only hint that “there is a story [about] how the Doctor comes by” this incarnation of the device.	0
A source close to Robert Pattinson has suggested that his engagement to singer FKA Twigs is on the outs–and that he may be moving on with Katy Perry. “He is technically still with FKA Twigs, but it doesn’t seem like it will last,“ an insider tells E! News. “They were serious at one point, but not anymore.” The source goes on to say that the 31-year-old actor has been good friends with Perry for several years, but that “you never know what will happen in the future.“ “Rob already feels single. He and FKA have had major distance and tension between them for months now,“ the informant continues. “They really tried to make it work, and it’s not long until the split will be public. They have just been trying to figure out how to sort everything.“ Pattinson made headlines in July after he said he’s only “kind of“ engaged to Twigs during a radio interview.

In a landmark moment, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his brother, Prince Harry, have sat down for on-camera interviews to discuss the aftermath of the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The conversations will air as part of a two-hour documentary, Diana, 7 Days, which will premiere on NBC Friday, Sept. 1 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, the network announced on Thursday.  “Part of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her,” Prince William says in the doc. “I think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn’t protect her. We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was. Do our duties as sons in protecting her.”  Directed by documentarian Henry Singer (9/11: The Falling Man), Diana, 7 Days examines the week between Diana’s death and her funeral. Family members, close friends, political figures, and journalists will be featured, including Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Earl Spencer, and Lady Sarah McCorquodale.  Princess Diana died on Aug. 31, 1997 from injuries sustained in a car crash in France, a loss that rippled throughout the world. HBO recently debuted a documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, which focuses on her presence as a mother and was created with the blessing of her sons.  According to a press release for Diana, 7 Days, Prince William and Prince Harry will share their first reactions to the news of their mother’s death, memories of the public mourning period, their reactions on the day of the funeral, personal memories of their mother, and what she meant to them both then and now.  “When she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking,” Prince Harry says in the documentary. “It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you’re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it’s lodged in here, there, wherever — in your heart, in your head, and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it’s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.”  Diana, 7 Days is executive-produced by Alison Kirkham and Peter Dale for the BBC, and produced by Singer, Jenny Saunders, and Jessica Ludgrove.	0
"Oscar Isaac named his son after his late mother.  The 'Ex Machina' actor and his partner Elvira Lind welcomed a little boy into the world in April, and he has now revealed the tot is called Eugene in honour of his beloved mother Eugenia, who passed away in February.  And Oscar told the New York Times newspaper the little boy has his mother's lips and hands.  The 38-year-old actor is currently starring in a production of 'Hamlet' and agreed to take on the title role in the Shakespearean tragedy because it resonated with him at a time when his partner was pregnant and his mother was ill.  He said: ""There were a lot of things that really connected on a very personal level.  ""[Performing] is how I'm able to function. The only way that I'm really able to process stuff is through reflecting it.""  While his mother was ill in a Florida hospital, Oscar comforted her by reading aloud to her from the play.  He recalled: ""I would just read the play all the time, do bits for her. Me doing Shakespeare was her favourite thing.  ""I didn't know how to process any of this, but this I knew how to do.""  And the 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' actor hopes his performance in the play ""honors"" his beloved parent."	0

Here come the brides! Ellen Page revealed that she and girlfriend Emma Portner tied the knot!  “Can’t believe I get to call this extraordinary woman my wife,” the 30-year-old actress captioned an Instagram photo on Wednesday, January 3, of she and the dancer’s hands sporting elegant wedding bands.  Although the low-key couple have yet to speak publicly about their relationship, they have been seen together holding hands and locking lips on multiple occasions since first stepping out in July 2017. Before romancing Portner, the Oscar nominee dated Samantha Thomas from September 2015 to early 2017.  Page has been open about her sexuality since coming out as gay on Valentine’s Day 2014. While speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in May 2014, the Juno star revealed that she is so “f—king happy” and “every tiny aspect of [her] life feels better.” Later that year, Page covered Out magazine and was honored as their Entertainer of the Year for making strides in the LGBT community.  The Inception actress also opened up about coming out during an interview with Stephen Colbert in September 2015. “I feel so grateful to feel how I feel now, compared to [how I felt] when I was a closeted person. It’s not a nice place to be,” she explained. “[Staying in the closet] is toxic. I wish that no one had to live that way.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!	0
Kris Jenner has ordered a family gathering at her Hidden Hills home ASAP to discuss Rob’s recent outburst and mental state. The Momager has instructed all of her daughters as well as Kanye and Bruce to drop what they are doing and help her deal with this crisis.  Kris Jenner is a woman who get’s things done, which is exactly why she jumped into action as soon as she saw Rob Kardashian‘s, shocking message on Instagram comparing his sister Kim Kardashian to Rosamund Pike’s sociopathic Gone Girl character. The family matriarch has quickly circled the wagons and ordered a family meeting to strategize how to deal with Rob’s situation.  Kris Jenner On Rob Kardashian’s Message: Orders Emergency Family Meeting  Kris was certainly shocked when she saw Rob’s post with the caption, “This is my sister kim , the bitch from Gone Girl,,,” — but instead of standing around doing nothing the 59-year-old manager started working the phones.  “Kris ordered Kim, Kanye, Khloe, Bruce and everyone else to her house for an emergency family meeting to figure out how to best handle this situation,” a Kardashian family source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “That’s how Kris handles a family crisis’ with a big family meeting. She want’s everyone there to make sure they are on the same page. Part of the meeting will be to brainstorm ways to help Rob, but another part will definitely be so Kris can make sure everyone is on message.”  Rob’s recent behavior is definitely scaring the family, so they understand the urgency of Kris’ calls.  “Rob has become progressively more and more anti social. He always plays down his issues but it’s time something has to change. Rob has a dark sense of humor and tries to play off his outbursts like they are a joke, but this latest post definitely got everyone’s attention. They just can’t afford to ignore him anymore.”  Kris Jenner Furious That Rob Kardashian Bashed Kim Kardashian On Instagram  What exactly will be discussed at the family gathering we don’t know yet, but we hope that everyone has Rob’s best interest at heart. As we previously reported, Kris was initially furious about his inappropriate post.  “Instead of seeing Rob’s Instagram as a cry for help Kris is pissed that Rob is taking to social media to bash the family,” a source tells us. “She has told Rob to apologize to Kim but he has refused which is only getting Kris more heated.”  What do you think HollywoodLifers, does Rob need help?  — Tim Plant	1

"The third episode in Season 7 of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" finally brought Jon Snow and Daenerys together. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)  They are all eventful episodes at this point. And they better be. This time we got the most-anticipated meeting of the entire series with Dany and Jon finally coming face to face and we also saw another major character death. But this episode gets some bonus points because it was actually pretty funny. You’d expect things to be nothing but deadly serious as we draw closer to the conclusion, but a bit of levity like Davos’s introduction of Jon will always be welcome. Now to what happened.  [Read Alyssa Rosenberg’s review of “The Queen’s Justice""]    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)    Daenerys and Jon finally come face to face  As Jon, Davos and their party sail into Dragonstone, they are met by Daenerys’s greeting party led by Tyrion and Missandei. This allows Jon and Tyrion to make each other’s acquaintance for the first time since back in Season 1. That’s when Jon was just a lowly member of the Night’s Watch and Tyrion visited the Wall so he could live out one of his dreams by peeing off the top. (Those were simpler times.) “It’s been a long road but we’re both still here,” Tyrion says to Jon, which is maybe how I’ll sum things up in these recaps when they inevitably drag on and on. Jon and Davos hand over their weapons, Davos tries to make small talk with Missandei while Jon and Tyrion do the same on their trek to the castle. The conversation is interrupted when Rhaegar, Viserys and Drogon do a well-timed flyby and buzz the group. “I’d say you get used to them but you never really do,” Tyrion notes.  Walking into the throne room, Missandei introduces Daenerys like she’s about to step into the ring and fight for the unified middleweight championship of the world. “You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. Rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Rightful Queen to the Andals and First Men. Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. The Mother of Dragons. The Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea. The Unburnt. The Breaker of Chains.”  Davos and Jon share a glance before Davos chimes in: “This is Jon Snow … he’s King in the North.” It’s the funniest moment of an episode that had a few legit laugh lines. The back and forth that follows and the conflict at the center of it gets to the main issue at the heart of the show. Daenerys wants Jon to bend the knee and pledge loyalty in her effort to take the Iron Throne. Jon could care less about the Iron Throne and is more worried about the army of dead that’s on its way to wipe out all of humanity. The very same army that almost everyone he tells about refuses to believe actually exists.  Dany does her best to talk Jon into bending the knee, using both logic and intimidation — the North has pledged in perpetuity to House Targaryen, she has the dragons, she has the Dothraki. She’ll make Jon warden of the North, he just has to bend that knee. But he won’t shut up about the White Walkers and the Night King. Dany runs through the hell she’s endured from the moment of her birth and maybe rips off a Tupac lyric in the process (“So many men have tried to kill me i don’t remember all their names”) and tells Jon that what got her through everything was faith in herself, that she was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She does not lack confidence. Jon reminds her that she’ll rule a graveyard if the Night King isn’t stopped. Davos steps up and tells everyone that Jon is no slouch himself. Maybe Dany has destiny on her side, but look at Jon — from bastard to King in the North, the first to bring men and wildlings together, he even took a knife in the heart and gave his own li — hold that thought, Davos. Jon shoots him a look. Let’s not get into the whole black magic resurrection thing right now, we just met these people.  Tyrion finally says what we were all thinking — if these battles of the living don’t matter, then what’s the harm in just bending the knee? But Jon still can’t do it, and to Dany this means he’s in open rebellion. But she won’t make him a prisoner. Yet.  Jon and Tyrion get more time to catch up when they go separately to the designated brooding corner of Dragonstone. Tyrion is brooding because he didn’t see the Euron Greyjoy’s surprise attack coming; Jon is brooding because it is simply what he does. “You make me feel like I’m failing at brooding,” Tyrion tells Jon (another laugh line!), before telling him that he actually believes Jon about the White Walkers. That doesn’t mean it will be easy to convince other people, whose minds can handle the idea of a problem like Cersei (“a familiar monster”) but not one like an army of the dead. Tyrion expertly finds a middle ground, though — he convinces Jon that Daenerys is on the side of good and that it’s unreasonable to expect her to commit to fighting an enemy she hasn’t seen as explained by a man she doesn’t know. So what’s something reasonable he can help Jon with?    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  And that would be the dragonglass buried beneath Dragonstone. Dany can barely be bothered with this, but Tyrion says this dragonglass can apparently kill White Walkers, or something like that. (He seems as annoyed with this oh-so-convenient plot device as many of us are.) Dany’s more interested in whether Tyrion himself believes in the White Walkers and he drops an ancient piece of wisdom — a wise man once said you should never believe something just because you want to believe it. Daenerys busts him: “Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?” Tyrion convinces her that she has nothing to lose by giving Jon the dragonglass; Dany wants to know about the whole “knife in the heart” thing Davos briefly mentioned and Tyrion tries to pass it off as those crazy northerners and their crazy talk.  Later, when Dany tells Jon she’ll allow him to mine for dragonglass, the two seem to have found at least a tenuous truce. Jon wonders if this means that Dany believes him about the undead, but doesn’t get an affirmative response.  [‘Game of Thrones’ killed off one fan favorite but regained another]    Rosabell Laurenti Sellers as Tyene Sand, Hafpor Julius Bjornsson as Gregor Clegane, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Indira Varma as Ellaria Sand in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  Cersei is just as sadistic as ever  Euron Greyjoy takes a victory lap through King’s Landing, being cheered on by the peasants as he drags Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand behind him as prisoners. The whole thing is very arousing to him, but then again this guy seems to be in a constant state of arousal. He gets a full round of applause as he walks into the throne room, where he’s greeted by Cersei on the Iron Throne and presents her with his previously promised gift. He gives her what no other man could give — justice. Ellaria, who knows the rest of her life is going to be unspeakably awful (and that was before spotting the Mountain) spits at Cersei’s feet.  Euron’s intentions are clear — he wants to marry Cersei and take the power that would come with their union. Cersei agrees, but not until the war is won. Euron is feeling good about things, enough to taunt Jaime that he’ll soon be taking his place next to Cersei, on the throne and in the bedroom. He even asks for advice: “Gentle or rough?” before adding something off-color that cannot be printed in a publication like this, unless, that is, it is said by the White House communications director.  Down in the Red Keep, Cersei relishes time with her two Dornish prisoners, Ellaria Sand and the One Sand Snake Who Didn’t Die. And for the next few minutes it’s pure, uncut Cersei. The primo stuff. “I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover’s head,” she tells Ellaria, and goes from there. Crossing Cersei in any way will provoke her; murdering her only daughter gets you the special treatment. Cersei’s first act of revenge against Ellaria — you get the feeling this will be drawn out in an agonizing way — is to kill the Living Sand Snake the same way Ellaria killed Myrcella, a kiss with poison. Cersei plants the kiss of death (and quickly drinks the serum) and explains how Ellaria (chained and gagged mere feet away from her daughter) will watch the slow death that will unfold over the next few days. “Your daughter will die here in this cell and you will be there watching when she dies.”  A little torture and murder gets Cersei hot and bothered, because soon she’s jumping Jaime’s bones and the two of them are back to their passionately incestuous ways. The next morning a toweringly confident Cersei not only doesn’t make Jaime hide when a chambermaid comes knocking to tell her she has a visitor, but also instructs said chambermaid that they’ll need fresh sheets for the bed. (See, this was a funny episode.)    Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister and Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)    Olenna Tyrell has zinged her last zinger  We were all gearing up for a brutal and extended Battle for Casterly Rock, but it never transpired. The Unsullied (led by Grey Worm) invaded and suffered some losses, but had a pretty easy time taking the seat of House Lannister. Why was it so easy? Two reasons: 1. Tyrion sneaked the best fighters into the heart of the city through the sewers that his favorite prostitutes traveled discreetly, and 2. the 10,000-strong Lannister army was just a shell of itself. Grey Worm knew it shouldn’t have been that easy and realized they had sort of been had when he sees the Greyjoy fleet destroying the Unsullied’s ships in the Casterly Rock harbor, basically stranding them and making them a sitting target.  As for those missing Lannister men, they were over in Highgarden, easily overwhelming the Tyrell army and taking the city. You have to give Cersei credit so far, her battle plans have been top-notch. Jaime finds Olenna Tyrell alone in her chambers and she is resigned to her fate.  Olenna does have one last speech in her, admitting she did unspeakable things to protect her family but that they were all necessary. Meanwhile Cersei has done things that Olenna didn’t think were capable of imagining, and that she’s truly a monster. “She’s a disease and I regret my role in spreading it,” she says to Jaime. “You will, too.” (Foreshadowing the popular theory that Jaime will kill his sister?) Jaime will still let Olenna die with some dignity, avoiding the fate of Ellaria and simply downing some poison and being done with it. Jaime pours it into her wine glass and Olenna chugs it down immediately, saying she will hate to die like Jaime’s son before dropping her last bit of revenge on the Lannisters and admitting that she was the one who poisoned Joffrey. “Tell Cersei,” she instructs Jaime. “I want her to know it was me.” Farewell, Queen of Thorns. And farewell to the Tyrells, who seem to be more-or-less eliminated from the world.    Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark and Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  Bran returns to Winterfell  Sansa has taken to running things in Winterfell, and rather well. Either that or the people in charge of food and armor are idiots, but command does seem to suit her, as Littlefinger points out. In pure Littlefinger fashion, he wants to get to plotting. And he honestly has the most refreshing take on the Battle of the Seven Kingdoms vs. Battle Against the Army of Dead dilemma. Basically — either we all die, or life will win out. And if the latter happens, what then? He goes on and on about how everyone is an enemy and Sansa must think through every possible series of events and how everything is happening at once and it’s a bit confusing but serves as good preparation for what comes next. And that’s the appearance of Bran Stark.  Sansa and Bran catch up by the weirwood tree and Bran informs his sister that he can never be Lord of Winterfell or lord of anything because he’s the Three-Eyed Raven now. “I don’t know what that means,” says Sansa, speaking for literally every single one of us. “It’s difficult to explain,” says Bran, which at least gives me an out from having to explain it. Short version — he can see everything that’s ever happened, and everything that will happen, but he needs to better harness his powers. Sansa wants to know how he knows all this; Bran says the Three-Eyed Raven taught him. Sansa says, I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven. Before they go full Abbott & Costello, Bran starts to get all mystical and Sansa says she has to, uh, go somewhere else right now.  Jorah is healed  The maester in Oldtown checks out Jorah Mormont with some ancient stethoscope and gives him a clean bill of health. Jorah claims it was the rest and the climate that made him better, which would sound better if he was in rehab and not dying of a flesh-eating, brain-infecting bacteria. He’s off to find Daenerys now.  Jorah’s claims of rest obviously don’t convince the maester, who knows Sam operated on Jorah even though it was strictly forbidden. The maester is impressed and asked how Sam did it; Sam just read the book and followed the instructions. The maester then informs Sam that his next assignment is to put together a Malm bed frame. No, he just has to make copies of some ancient manuscripts and scrolls, because that’s what they do in Oldtown.    Conleth Hill as Varys and Carice Van Houten as Melisandre in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  That weird Melisandre/Varys conversation  As Jon Snow came to Dragonstone, Melisandre was watching alone, from afar, before Varys tracked her down. “I’ve brought ice and fire together,” she says, saying that her work is done. She’s also trying to stay out of the way of Jon Snow and Davos, who both have their issues with her. She’s off to Volantis and Varys thinks that’s a good thing, and that she should not return to Westeros. But her final line to him hints that she has one more part to play in this tale: “I have to die in this strange country, just like you.”  PREVIOUS SEASON 7 RECAPS  Episode 2: “Stormborn”  Episode 1: “Dragonstone”"	0
Giuliana Rancic is set to return as the co-host of “E! News,” the cable network announced Friday.  “Giuliana is an incredibly charismatic and well-respected entertainment journalist. As a longtime member of the E! family, it’s exciting to welcome her back home to ‘E! News,’” said John Najarian, executive vice president and general manager of news and digital for E!. “While ‘E! News’ has seen massive growth across digital and social, we have also continued to expand and elevate our television coverage, and Giuliana is an excellent addition to our weeknight series, which remains the most watched entertainment news franchise with young women.”  Rancic was previously the co-host of the nigtly entertainment news show from 2005-2015. She will return to the show on Sept. 4, where she will join co-host Jason Kennedy. Most recently, Rancic was part of E!’s coverage of the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and has also covered red carpets and other special events for the network. She will continue as co-host of E!’s “Live From the Red Carpet” after her return to “E! News.”  “Returning to host ‘E! News’ is every bit as thrilling to me today as it was 16 years ago when I joined the show and embarked on this wonderful career,” said Rancic. “Co-hosting alongside one of my best friends, Jason Kennedy, with one of the most talented teams in entertainment journalism, makes this move even more special. I can’t wait to reconnect with the ‘E! News’ audience and go on this journey together once again.”  Rancic’s return comes after the departure of Maria Menounos last summer. But more recently, E! host Catt Sadler departed after she says she learned of a substantial pay gap between herself and Kennedy. E! disputed Sadler’s claims, saying that she and Kennedy had “different roles,” with Sadler focused on daytime while Kennedy worked in primetime and did red carpet coverage.	0

"(CNN) Two jurors in Bill Cosby's assault trial offered differing accounts of their deadlocked deliberations that underscore how differently they may have viewed the case.  However, a different juror told CNN affiliate WPXI that jurors were in a ""true deadlock"" and that votes were generally split along 7-5 or 5-7 votes for most of the deliberations.  Both jurors spoke on the condition of anonymity because jurors were told not to comment on the proceedings inside the jury room.  The jury room insights came less than a week after the trial judge declared a mistrial in Cosby's case, as jurors reported being hopelessly deadlocked over more than 50 hours of deliberations. The judge presiding over Cosby's trial released the names of the 12 jurors and six alternates in the case on Wednesday.  Cosby faced three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Prosecutors say Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, the former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team, at his home near Philadelphia in January 2004.  According to the juror who spoke to ABC News, the vote was 10-2 to convict him on charges that he digitally penetrated Constand without her consent, and 10-2 that he gave her drugs that substantially impaired her ability to resist. The vote was 11-1 to acquit Cosby on a charge that he digitally penetrated Constand while she was unconscious or unaware, the juror said.  The juror who spoke to WPXI said that the 10-2 split happened at one point but that jurors changed their votes before a tally could be sent to the judge.  In most criminal cases, verdicts must be unanimous.  CNN has tried to reach most of the jurors but has not gotten responses from them. On Thursday, the door of one juror's home had a note saying, ""NO interviews. Please do not ring bell.""  A note saying ""NO interviews"" was taped to the door of a juror's home.  The juror who spoke with ABC News said tensions ran high in the too-small jury room.  ""They were just literally walking in circles where they were standing because they were losing their minds. People would just start crying out of nowhere,"" the juror said. We wouldn't even be talking about [the case], and people would just start crying.""  At one point, a male juror even punched a concrete wall, possibly breaking his pinky knuckle, the juror said.  Jurors' names released  After requests from media outlets, including CNN, Judge Steven O'Neill decided to release the names, while keeping the jury deliberations confidential, according to a court document released Wednesday.  The document states that a disclosure of anything said or done during deliberations ""would have a chilling effect upon future jurors in this case and their ability to deliberate freely.""  Prosecutors have said they will retry the case.  The court emphasized that jurors are not allowed to disclose the opinions and thoughts of their fellow jurors as well as any arguments or comments made, or votes cast, by fellow jurors during deliberations.  The names were released to the public after the court contacted the jurors and gave them instructions.  The jurors for the trial were selected in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and taken to Montgomery County, near Philadelphia, where they were sequestered for the 12 days of trial and deliberations.  According to the post-trial instructions, the judge acknowledged the freedom of the press, stating ""there is no law forbidding (reporters) to question discharged jurors,"" and adding that a juror can decline to be interviewed at any time.  The document said the court had ""significant concerns"" over publishing the names during the trial when attempts to interview jurors' families and friends, who would likely have contacted the jurors, would have caused ""consternation and distraction from their sworn duty.""  The prosecution filed a memorandum opposing the release of the names, saying it ""could have a chilling effect on future jurors and could impair both parties' right to a fair and impartial trial."" The defense team later joined that request.  After balancing the rights of all parties, the court decided to release the names, the document said."	1

So sweet! Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.  “OK, I know I’m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife’s new show – @thesinnerusa – is amazing,” the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. “It’s like nothing I’ve seen her in before, and she’s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. –JT.”  The actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a “whydunit” rather than a “whodunit,” follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. “I just did it. And I don’t know why,” a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.  Biel opened up about The Sinner, which is based on Petra Hammesfahr‘s 2008 novel of the same name, during a recent appearance on the Today show. “We are not looking for who, we are looking for why,” she said of the plot. “Why did this seemingly normal young woman who has a family and a child and husband, why did she do this horrific act? … We all as human beings have the possibility to snap and we don’t do it. But what makes us cross the line?”  The 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she’d react if her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. “It’s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it’s hard to say yes because it’s such an intense experience,” she said on Today. “It’s a tough business. It’s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.”  The Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.

"CLOSE The Grammy Award winner made the announcement on Twitter in a video co-starring his friend and late night TV host Jimmy Fallon. This will be Justin Timberlake's third halftime performance. USA TODAY  Justin Timberlake needs to apologize to Janet Jackson. He should start apologizing now, with the news that he's confirmed to perform at the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show. He should do so as publicly as possible. And at the very least, he should invite her onstage at the show, to perform a song, or 10.  Those are several demands of the viral #JusticeForJanet hashtag, which emerged following the news of Timberlake's halftime booking. Because, even as Timberlake's career has flourished in the 13 years since ""Nipplegate,"" Jackson's fans haven't forgotten that Timberlake is complicit in the unjust treatment of their icon.  In a moment that’s still painful to watch more than a decade later, Timberlake exposed Jackson's breast during her Super Bowl halftime show in 2004 in front of an audience of 143.6 million viewers. The night was supposed to belong to Jackson, who was the seasoned pop star to Timberlake’s rookie. Jackson had invited the then-rising boy band *NSYNC to open for her Velvet Rope tour in 1998, then lent her vocals to Timberlake’s debut album, Justified, after he went solo.  Considering how Timberlake has molded himself in Michael Jackson’s image from the beginning of his solo career, his Super Bowl cameo was meant to be a reunion with his mentor, a chance for him to pay homage to Janet’s pop legacy.  Timberlake needs to apologize because he played a role in hijacking this legacy, starting with the wardrobe malfunction that barely impacted his career while sending Jackson's into free-fall.  The aftermath of the 'wardrobe malfunction.' (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP)  In the weeks after the “wardrobe malfunction,” a phrase that will be forever linked to Jackson’s humiliation, she became a comedy punchline and was blacklisted by Viacom (which kept her music off MTV, VH1, and radio stations around the country).  There seemed to be no question the incident was Jackson’s fault, down to the media outlets that selectively edited her videotaped apology. “Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident,” she later told Ebony.  And while Timberlake has maintained that the incident was an accident, he hasn't taken responsibility for the part he played. ""I'm frustrated at the whole situation,"" he told reporters the week after the Super Bowl. ""I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And the fact of the matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music.""  Timberlake has apologized further in the years since, telling MTV in 2006 that he ""probably got 10% of the blame,"" and that America is ""unfairly harsh on ethnic people."" Yet, he's still unsure how to address the scandal, bungling an exchange last year when a Twitter follower called on him to ""stop appropriating our music and culture"" and ""apologize to Janet too.”  ""Oh, you sweet soul,"" he responded. ""The more you realize that we are the same, the more we can have a conversation. Bye.”  Timberlake is very much not ""the same."" His privilege hasn't only enabled him to score hit albums and film roles and Oscar nominations and a Super Bowl slot, but also lets him play dumb about his own role in a scandal that, as he previously acknowledged, amounted to America piling on a black woman and shaming her for her sexuality while granting him a free pass.    And Timberlake needs to apologize now, more than ever, considering how the news of his booking comes during a blistering month for women reckoning with sexual humiliation. In the wake of Harvey Weinstein’s downfall, women around the world have continued to share their stories about how men’s inappropriate actions ruined their lives.  Seeing Timberlake invited back to the Super Bowl while Jackson’s career still bears visible scars from the incident is a bitter reminder of which people society punishes more for so-called sexual indiscretions.

Singer Madison Beer is speaking out – and urging her fans to do the same – after a recording emerged of her allegedly being verbally abused by boyfriend Jack Gilinsky.  In a since-deleted message to her fans on Tuesday, 18-year-old star told fans that she stayed with Gilinsky amid multiple instances of mistreatment in an effort to “fix him” and prevent him from treating other women the same way.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Beer, a YouTube star who was discovered by Justin Bieber, who personally signed her to Island Records, did not make clear whether she had split with Gilinsky – also a YouTube star. But, she said that she hopes her fans will learn from her mistakes and not tolerate abuse.  In her post, she also alleged that the leaked tape was not the first time that Gilinsky had mistreated her – with the first incident coming a year ago.  “Don’t make the same mistakes I did, your safety is never worth it. No matter what, no one deserves to be treated that way,” she wrote.  Gilinsky, 20, took to Twitter Sunday to acknowledge and apologize for his actions on a leaked tape in which he used “terrible … unforgivable” words about Beer.  “Many of you [have been] asking me ‘Why would you stay with him if it happened last year!’ ” Beer wrote. “My theory was, and as horrible as this is, is that if I left him, he’d do it to the next girl. I tried to fix him.”  Gilinsky’s own statement spoke to the circumstances: “In no way do I stand behind who I was in that part of my life. But people change & learn from their mistakes. The clip you’ve all heard is from last year. I was in a very dark place, & clearly had no control over my emotions.”  In her post, Beer continued, “We have both grown and changed so much at this point and it has been an extremely difficult thing to relive / even go thru … and I hope ALL of my fans learn from my foolishness. If someone is mistreating you in ANY way please speak up.”  Jack Gilinsky has been exposed as an abusive boyfriend after audio surfaced of him lashing out at Madison Beer. #JackGilinskyIsOverParty pic.twitter.com/ixGCiRRmPt — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) July 1, 2017  In his statement, Gilinsky called the recorded episode “one of our lowest points” and said, “Madison knew if she didn’t help me overcome my ways and change, no one would, & I would never learn from my mistakes. I’ll never be able to thank her enough for believing in me the way she did during that time.”  Reps for Beer and Gilinsky did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for additional comment.	0

It's been quite a while since Zedd, 27, and Selena Gomez, 25, dated in 2015, but we still have a special place for the couple in our hearts. Zedd was always so sweet and tender toward Selly, even after they split. However, it turns out that that wasn't ALWAYS the case. As a matter of fact, he told Billboard that there was a time when he was downright ""pissed"" while dating her! Click here for pics of the former duo.  ""Reporters were calling my parents,"" he said, describing how insane the media frenzy was after the public learned of the star-studded relationship. ""People were hacking my friends' phones. I was pissed."" It's not that he was surprised, but it was still freaky to be so bombarded. ""I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,"" he explained. ""She is one of the most talked about people in the world, but I had no idea how much that would change my life.""  Clearly Zedd isn't interested in being involved in that kind of media frenzy again. He refused to tell Billboard whether or not he's dating anyone at the moment. One thing he will talk about is his strong feelings towards Donald Trump. ""No matter how big the scandal is, no matter how insane a [Trump] tweet is, it just keeps going. You feel powerless, and that's terrible to me,"" he ranted. ""Take that to a bigger scale and you end up in North Korea, where people are slaves of their own country!"" He even urged his fellow EDM stars to use their voices, even when it's scary. ""They don't want to lose fans. I understand where they are coming from, but I disagree with that being a good reason not to speak up."""	0
Tristan Thompson has slapped Khloe Kardashian with a shocking list of demands after his explosive cheating scandal, RadarOnline.com learned exclusively.  The NBA star amped up his controlling behavior “in return for staying in Khloe’s life in the long-term,” spilled a family insider.  PHOTOS: Ruby Rose Butts Into Khloe Kardashian’s Nasty Twitter Feud With Chloe Grace Moretz  “Tristan continues to insist he’s done nothing wrong, and blames Khloe’s family for exaggerating his womanizing and trying to ruin his reputation.”  Thompson refused to back down as confused Kardashian continued to struggle with her decision of whether to stay or leave her cheating baby daddy.  “He’s willing to walk away, but Khloe’s desperate to work this out, so Tristan’s in the driving seat right now.”  Ultimatums were set for the KUWTK star on the heels of his infidelity.  “He’s agreed to stick around for now, but only if the family stops spreading stories, and he gets cut into Khloe’s portion of profits for the show,” the source added.

"Mac Miller is finally sharing how he felt when his ex-girlfriend Ariana Grande got engaged to Pete Davidson.  The ""Missed Calls"" rapper and Grande split back in May after about two years together. By late June, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star had confirmed his engagement to Grande during an interview with late-night host Jimmy Fallon.  Miller, 26, admitted that the situation was ""strange.""  ""Like the whole thing is a little strange, but it's not negative.

And it's that simple, you know?""  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  The rapper said he purposely stayed away from social media -- but not because of the breakup. Instead, he wanted to focus on his highly-anticipated forthcoming album, ""Swimming,"" out Aug. 3. He said the timing of his not being on the internet as much and Grande's engagement have sparked worried comments.  ""I haven't been on the internet,"" he said. ""So, you know, people have assumed that I'm ... 'Are you OK? Is everything OK?'""  ""Because I was about to drop the album,"" he said. ""I don't know, it just all seemed kind of unimportant, the need to show people I was OK. Like, what is that? Where does that come from? Why?

How to perform a Satanic Destruction Ritual  Photo by Levan TK (LA Weekly).  I’ve come to learn that rituals are treated very similarly to masturbation in society. It’s something everyone does (whether they like to admit it or not), we’re told to be ashamed of their practice, but they both make us feel good. Rituals are a very personal thing, and seldom understood writ large. If you’re out with people and you tell them you did a ritual earlier that day, odds are you’ll be met with the same response as if you told them you jerked off that morning.  What are rituals?  The truth is, that all of human life is made of rituals.  Mere mention of the word generally conjures images of occult symbols painted on the walls of decrepit basements, animal sacrifice, and strange chanting that reverberates off the walls of horror film scenery and news headlines to assault the American imagination. However, rituals are a universal feature of human cognitive function and social structure. It’s time we reevaluate what the meaning of a ritual is, and recognize the potential (dare I say) benefits of doing such things — specifically here the Destruction Ritual.  Rituals have a strange role in my life. Coming from an academic background in anthropology, the anthropological definition is engrained in my mind. The formal definition in that field is:  “Rituals are actions with intentional symbolic meaning undertaken for a specific cultural purpose, such as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, and may reinforce broader community social bonds, as in a wedding. They are used to reinforce social bonds and structure.”  Traditional Oriya Wedding Ceremony in India is a right-of-passage ritual practiced by those of the Hindu faith to ceremonialize the union between two people.  Communion is a Christian ritual in which bread and wine are consumed to symbolically represent the body and blood of Christ being consummated and taken into his worshippers.  New Year’s Eve ritual practiced by Americans in New York every year on January 31st at Midnight in which a giant ball is “dropped” from the top of Time Square and confetti is released to celebrate the arrival of another year.  I’m also a chapter head for The Satanic Temple, so writing and performing rituals has become a foundational and therapeutic practice for me. For the last few years, I’ve found myself straddling a line between scientific objectivism and emotional catharsis with the subject.  Rituals are repeated human actions to fulfill, reinforce and maintain a part of the human function and experience. Brushing our teeth is a ritual created to tend to our dental health. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are daily rituals to tend to our caloric intake. Prayer before bed, meals or at church every Sunday is a ritual to tend to piety and relationship with God. Going to the gym is a ritual to tend to maintenance of our muscular and cardiovascular systems. But why don’t gym bags, toothbrushes and Eggo waffles send people running for the hills?  The media-driven Manson case heavily polluted the concept of rituals in America.  The media has heavily slandered the practice of rituals. The taboo has gone so far in the U.S. as to compelling hundreds of police departments nationally to create specific manuals for identifying Satanic rituals and effectively “busting” anyone caught doing them. This has had devastating side effects on our society (see The Satanic Panic of the 1980s & 1990s). Countless people who simply didn’t fit the mold of their community have been falsely accused of and imprisoned for horrible crimes ranging from rape to murder.  What is The Satanic Temple?  The Satanic Temple is a religious and activist organization that was birthed from the idea that we are at a point in history where combating the status quo is an essential component of progression as individuals and as a society. In our view, Satan is a mascot for combating bigotry and detrimental authority. We see God and Satan as literary figures that have become so deeply engrained in our culture that much of our public policy and legislation is based upon their story.  In the infamous revolt of the angels, Satan (let’s refer to him as Lucifer the Angel, as he is called in the New Testament) was, of the angels created by God, said to be the most perfect, powerful, and intelligent. God essentially created these angels to be hit men — immediately sending them off on quests to murder people who challenged him. Lucifer identified this problem, rallied some of the other angels, and confronted God to challenge his authority. Most any Christian you talk to will see this as Lucifer being arrogant, but we see it as bravery. As a result of Lucifer’s revolt, he was cast out of heaven by God, where he then fell to Earth and bestowed the gift of knowledge to human kind (specifically to Eve in the Garden of Eden in Genesis). We see ourselves as aligning with a literary figure that is heavily misinterpreted, and undertaking the same mission. Since we don’t believe in the supernatural, the concept of a nontheistic but Satanic ritual seems like an oxymoron.  What is the Destruction Ritual?  I’ll preface by saying, it’s not for invoking Satan, but rather combating harmful power over us just as Lucifer the angel did in the Bible. The Destruction Ritual was born from a tradition I have done for many years with friends and loved ones on New Year’s Eve. We would gather around a fire with some scraps of paper, pens, and a few bottles of liquor. We would take turns writing things down on the pieces of paper, reading them aloud, throwing them into the fire and then taking a shot. It would start out with us drawing dicks or writing silly stuff, but as the night progressed and the bottles emptied, we found ourselves sobbing, hugging, and getting some really sticky shit off our chests.  Then one year, we started bringing physical objects to destroy. Things that bore some kind of sentimental value we hung onto, but in reality just sat in a box in a closet somewhere and caused us negative emotions when we remembered they were there. We felt by hanging onto these objects, we were holding onto the hope of a failed relationship or the improvement of someone’s character, or a good memory we would cling to like this object was a life raft, but all it did was hurt us. My friend had a box of these creepy ceramic dogs her abusive grandfather gave her every year for her birthday. Another friend had an engagement ring from his ex fiancée that cheated in him. I had an antique children’s tambourine my ex gave me that I couldn’t let go of for some reason, as well as a bunch of photos and letters. We took turns smashing our objects with hammers, knives, and throwing the pieces into the fire. Afterwards, I felt a sense of empowerment I had never felt before, and an epiphany. The relationship was done, but I had let it still continue to hurt me by giving power to this stupid little plastic tambourine and a box of paper. By hanging onto them, I allowed the toxicity to seep into my everyday and gave something inanimate delusional purpose. We all cried, hugged, and stood around the fire silently watching the shards of our bad memories burn in the fire.  The Destruction Ritual serves this very purpose — destroying objects that we have given the power to hurt us. It’s a form of self love, as you are trusting that by destroying these stupid things, you will be stronger and lighter, so to speak, after doing it. So much of our culture revolves around material possessions. Our social status is assigned by what we have, our self worth is measured by what we have. We go into debt to buy cars and clothes and technology that pollutes the environment and will probably break and need to be replaced within two years anyway. In a way, you could stretch it and say the Destruction Ritual is your own petty way of combating the detrimental effects of capitalism. Whatever floats your boat.  Destruction Ritual performed by The Satanic Temple in Los Angeles during the Satanic Mass of 2017.  We performed this ritual (which also involves an incantation) at our Satanic Mass in January of 2017. Wedding rings, old medication bottles, gifts from exes and a diary were among the things destroyed. As I was reciting it, I looked at the audience and saw a lot of crying faces. Our Arizona chapter also performed it over the summer and it yielded a similar effect. This thing sounds goofy, but trust me, it feels really, really good.  So gather some loved ones, or just grab a hammer and ride solo. Here is the how to for the Destruction Ritual.  How to perform the Destruction Ritual:  Step One — Gather your object(s):  Preference is given to something you’re holding onto that has a negative association to a person or memory or action. Maybe it’s something you hide so it’s not in sight everyday to cause you grief, but it’s there and you can’t let go of it. It could be a possession or gift from someone abusive or cruel, a piece of clothing from “the old you”, bank statements or receipts from a time you made a poor financial decision, a token of some kind of failure (relationship, friendship, or a personal failure). If something doesn’t immediately come to mind, you can improvise. Write angry things you want to get off your chest onto a piece of paper and put it in a glass bottle.  Step Two — Find a good place to do it:  Ideally somewhere outdoors, where it’s safe to get dirty and have sharp pieces of your freshly destroyed bad memories around. It’s best to place plastic or something underneath so cleanup is easy and damage to surrounding area is minimized. Objects can also be placed on a platter of some kind. Fireplace, bonfire or fire pit is a bonus.  Step Three — Choose your weapon:  Depending on the object(s) you are destroying, choose your weapon of destruction. Hammers, daggers, baseball bats, crowbars, mallets, and knives work well. It’s really up to you and the space available to you. Don’t forget safety — if you are destroying something shatterable like glass or ceramics, wear safety glasses and gloves.  Step Four — Set the mood:  Light some candles, pick some music (we recommend Author & Punisher as an official TST Destruction Ritual selection), and lay your object(s) and weapon(s) of choice out.  Step Five — Recite the incantation:  * The “Ave Satanas” are totally optional and up to you, the reciter. But they’re fun to yell.  These were things that I held in my hands  These were things that belonged to me  These were things that I held in my heart  These were things that have meaning to me  These things are not dead, because they never carried life  But I gave these things life, because they have carried me  I gave these things my memories  My fear  My secrets  My tears  My blood  My devotion  My hate  My forgiveness  My pain  My pleasure  My love  My disdain  I am the creator of life in these things  For without me, they would not be  And people would seek to profit off what I give  With no mutual heart given back to me  We emancipate ourselves from this material slavery  For without my heart, these things would not be  (Ave Satanas)  We liberate ourselves from this endless cycle  Of voids filled with unnecessary greed  I fill my voids with love and compassion  I fill my voids with clarity  I fill my void with the beauty that surrounds me  I fill my voids with only that which propels me  (Ave Satanas)  Together we raise our arms and unshackle ourselves from the control these things have over us  Together we raise our hammers and daggers, and with them pierce the heart of that control  A power driven by addiction, attachment, consumption, and by a relentless hunger for excess  (Ave Satanas)  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  Step Six — Destroy your object(s):  Self-explanatory. Discard the pieces afterwards, there’s no point in holding on. Have at it, and be well. Ave Satanas, Hail Satan.	1

This article is over 8 months old  Duke of Edinburgh discharged after spending more than a week at King Edward VII hospital  The Duke of Edinburgh has been discharged from hospital after a hip operation.  Prince Philip, 96, left the private King Edward VII hospital in London at midday on Friday; he was admitted on Tuesday 3 April.  Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor, adding: “His royal highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received.”  On Thursday, he was visited by his daughter, the princess royal, who said he was “on good form”.  Anne, whose visit lasted about 50 minutes, is believed to be theonly member of the royal family to visit Philip in the central London hospital.  The Queen also gave an update, telling a wellwisher in Windsor: “He said he’s getting on very well.”  The duke will have begun his rehabilitation, moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of aftercare as he learns to walk again on his new hip.  For about a month before the operation, Philip had complained about trouble with the joint. Medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.  The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure aged 95, followed by an emergency operation when she was 97.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on 19 May is likely to be the first public appearance by the Queen’s consort since the operation.	0
Anne Heche and James Tupper have gone their separate ways after more than 10 years together, Us Weekly confirms.  During their time together, the pair welcomed son Atlas, 8, in 2009. According to court documents obtained by Us, the actress, 48, has filed a petition to establish custody and child support. Heche is seeking joint custody and “reasonable visitation” rights for both parents and is also asking that Tupper, 52, pay her legal fees during the court battle.  The former couple first met when they costarred in the ABC series Men in Trees in 2006, while she was married to ex-husband Coleman Laffoon. Heche then ended her marriage to the cameraman, and she began dating the Big Little Lies actor shortly after. The couple moved in together in 2007 and Heche’s rep confirmed that The Brave actress was expecting a child with Tupper in December 2008. During their relationship, the duo worked together on different projects, including the Syfy network’s show Aftermath and NBC’s The Brave.  Although they were together for more than a decade, the pair never married. In a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, Heche described herself as “eternally engaged” to Tupper, and said that she was in no rush to make things official. “I’ve already said yes. When I’m 60 I’m happy to walk down the aisle,” she said, also revealing that he bought her a new ring every year they didn’t tie the knot.  “Well, he’s given me a ring every year so I don’t want to stop that. I have quite a collection,” she said at the time. “Besides, I’ve been married before and so has he. I don’t know what either of us would gain or what would change that would benefit us.”  Heche also shares son Homer, 15, with her ex-husband. Prior to that marriage, the actress was in a high profile relationship with Ellen DeGeneres from 1997 until their split in 2000. Tupper was married to Kate Mayfield, but they divorced in 2006.

"However, you can see there are other people at the table, so it may just be a friendly meal (lol since when were they even friends?!)

When interviewed by Howard Stern, he was asked if they were engaged, in which R.Patz replied, ""Yeah, kind of.""  UM, how can you be kind of engaged?

The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards were a crazy, hilarious, bonkers success. Massive musical numbers, topless Adam Devine, and the weirdest Stranger Things/Get Out crossover you could possibly imagine, it was Awards Show insanity at its finest.  But just because you got your fair dose of fun on-screen, doesn’t mean there wasn’t a load of loopiness happening off-screen. Luckily, we were on the ground to bring you all the backstage, behind-the-scenes gossip. Like these golden nuggets…  The venue is haunted  Speak to any LA local and they’ll happily tell of the city’s many, many ghost stories. A lifetime of fame, fortune and famouses has led to all manner of tragedies, and so it’s unsurprising to hear many of its buildings are supposedly haunted.  A quick natter to any of the attendants working at The Shrine, this year’s venue for the MTV Movie & TV Awards, and you’d be regaled with all manner of ghostly stories. Ghosts of actors gone past wandering the halls, and eerie noises late at night, we were ready to channel our inner Ghostbuster HARD.  Alas, we didn’t see, hear or even smell a thing.  Who knows? This time next year, we may see the paranormal echo of a topless Adam Devine running around the halls.  Tyler Posey would date Logan  Before the entire red carpet was shut down due to an impromptu hailstorm (more on that later), we played a fun/stupid/amazing Movie & TV Awards-inspired game of Would You Rather. It included such genius questions as ‘Would You Rather Date Logan Or Beauty and the Beast’s Beast?’.  Tyler Posey is literally all of us.  Noah Cyrus rehearsed in her lounge wear  We were privy to watch Noah Cyrus prep for her awesome performance of XXXX. As amazing as her voice was the fact she was bouncing around preparing in bright pink lounge wear.  Turning up to work in our PJs (or close enough) is our literal spirit animal.  Asia Kate Dillon is gallantry goals  During the red carpet, the heavens opened up and hailstones rained down with aggressive abandon. We were chatting to Billions star Asia Kate Dillon at the time, who gracefully pulled our poncho over our heads as we struggled to survive the downpour.  Matt Risley  Beautiful, smart AND kind. MARRY US.  Sodden celebrity regroup  10 minutes after the heavens opened and it was soon clear the weather wasn’t going anywhere. As such, all the press and celebrities regrouped in the nearby cover of the venue’s car park. It was a surreal, amazing sight to see a bunch of famouses (including Barb from Stranger Things, Alaska from RuPaul’s Drag Race, and Tyler Posey all soaked, huddling undercover.  Amazing.  The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards airs in the UK on 8th May at 8pm – only on MTV!	0
Halle Berry Dumps Producer Boyfriend During Romantic Getaway  Can’t say we didn’t see this one coming… Another love affair has ended for Halle Berry!  Well to put it more accurately, 51-year-old Halle has called it quits with 35-year-old producer Alex Da Kid. And the way she did it was SO COLD!  According to In Touch reports, Halle broke up with Alex during a romantic vacation to Bora Bora:  “Halle broke up with Alex smack in the middle of their romantic getaway in Bora-Bora,” says a source, explaining that nearly halfway into the trip, Halle realized her five-month romance with the British music producer wasn’t working and had her assistant book her a flight home. “Halle decided he was too young and his communication skills were terrible. She said she needs someone who can think for themselves and is mature, smart and all-around adventurous,” the source explains to In Touch. Adds the source: “The last thing Halle needs is to be in a long-term relationship with a man who doesn’t express himself well.”  Yikes… Do you think he finished out the vacay or nah?	1

"Johnny Depp. Getty Many entertainment stars love the finer things in life, but it seems even the earnings of an A-lister like Johnny Depp couldn't sustain his wild indulgences.  The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star is currently in a public-relations tailspin after his messy divorce with actress Amber Heard, who alleged he had abused her, and his filing a $25 million lawsuit against his former business managers at The Management Group. (TMG has countersued.)  Things didn't get any better for Depp on Wednesday when The Hollywood Reporter published a feature that went deeper into Depp's financial woes.  TMG's Joel Mandel claims that even though Depp has earned more than $650 million in the more than 13 years the company represented the star, Depp didn't have enough cash to cover his $2 million in bills each month.  Depp's extravagant spending habits reportedly include $3.6 million annually for his 40-person staff, $350,000 monthly for maintaining his 156-foot yacht, $30,000 monthly for wine, and $5 million the star says he spent to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.  TMG says it met with Depp numerous times over the years to try to get Depp to sell some of his expensive items. On one occasion, he agreed to sell his $10 million yacht that he spent $8 million to renovate, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Another year, TMG almost got Depp to sell his French chateau — on which he spent $10 million to renovate — but he got cold feet after prospective buyers came calling, according to the former business managers, and it has since been relisted for $39 million.  Johnny Depp will be seen next in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" out May 26. Disney Depp has routinely earned $20 million up-front paychecks for the movies he's been in since the success of 2003's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" He also gets 20% of the backend per picture, according to The Hollywood Reporter — a source said that was $40 million from the backend of each ""Pirates"" movie and $55 million from his profit on the 2010 hit ""Alice in Wonderland,"" which earned over $1 billion worldwide.  TMG attorney Michael Kump said in the lawsuit that TMG stepped in to help Depp avert a ""devastating financial collapse."" Depp has claimed he was kept in the dark about his finances.  It's unclear how cash-strapped Depp is. According to litigation, he has received $25.7 million over the past two years in profits from six movies, and he earned up-front money — likely close to $20 million each — from ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" ""LAbyrinth,"" and ""Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes.""  A representative for Depp did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment."	0

"Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  ""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""  She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f--- Kanye up.”  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up."" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  ""Kim hopes people won’t hold Kanye’s actions against her,"" says the source, ""but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems."" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye’s out of town. ""It’s way less stressful,"" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he’s working. ""She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she’s doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye’s opinions are NOT hers.""  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her — and she’s got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have ""a third failed marriage under her belt,"" says the insider, ""there’s no coming back from Kanye’s latest meltdown. It’s time for Kim to not only distance herself from Kanye, but to make it offcial and divorce him.""  For more on this, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on stands now!

Kim Kardashian West and her sisters, Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian, are saying goodbye to a chapter in their lives.  The KKW beauty mogul, 37, announced on her app and website on Thursday that she and her siblings had decided to close all of their DASH storefronts.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “After nearly 12 years, my sisters and I have decided to close the doors of our DASH stores,” the mother of three began. “We opened our first store as a family in 2006 and since then we have made so many lifelong memories. From opening locations in Los Angeles, Miami and New York, to having our Dash Dolls spin-off show, it’s been such a huge part of our lives.”  “We’ve loved running DASH, but in the last few years we’ve all grown so much individually,” she continued. “We’ve been busy running our own brands, as well as being moms and balancing work with our families. We know in our hearts that it’s time to move on.”  Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images  “We love our DASH Dolls and are so grateful for the amazing memories — and we have to give a special thanks to the DASH employees and all of the incredible fans and customers who have supported us throughout the years!” Kardashian West added. “We couldn’t have done it without you.

Kardashian West is busy managing her own makeup line, KKW Beauty, while sister Khloé launched her jean line, Good American, last year. Kourtney is about to launch a new line with younger sister Kylie Jenner, KOURT X KYLIE.  All three are also mothers. Kim recently welcomed her third child, daughter Chicago West, while Kourtney has three children under the age of 10 with ex Scott Disick. Khloé recently welcomed her first child, daughter True Thompson.  The Kardashians’ fashion boutique in their hometown of Calabasas was the first storefront they opened. Later on, their store became a fixture in the first seasons of their hit E! reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  The sisters were consistently seen managing their store together on the show as they rose to fame. In their spinoff shows, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami and Kourtney and Kim Take New York, they were also seen opening up DASH stores in those major cities.  Another spinoff show, Dash Dolls, debuted in 2015 and focused on their employees as they got to know the Kardashians and managed the store while the sisters were away.  RELATED: Kim Kardashian West Shares Sweet New Photo of Daughter Chicago – As a Bear!  Last year, an employee in their Los Angeles store was held at gunpoint. A spokesperson for the West Hollywood Sheriff’s Department told PEOPLE at the time that a woman had walked into the store with a revolver and pointed it at one of the employees.  “[She] mumbled something, knocked some things off of the counter and then walked out,” the spokesperson said.  Earlier in 2017, LAPD investigated a theft that resulted in about $1,400 to $1,600 of stolen items, according to Entertainment Tonight. The suspect was caught on surveillance footage, giving police a good lead.	0
"The Cool News: Maternity clothes have come a long way, so you have plenty of options other than your husband's old jammie bottoms or the shapeless sweatshirt hiding in the back of your closet. Susan Baker, of Arlington, Virginia, appreciated that her maternity tops offered extra coverage when she was pregnant with Gia, now 1. ""It was so nice that I didn't have to display my flabby arms,"" she says. Ask any woman whose body is going through pregnancy changes: winter clothes hide those extra curves. (Plus, at this time of year, you generally don't have to worry about putting on a bathing suit.) And not only are winter maternity clothes more forgiving, they are also more versatile. Ingram liked being able to layer. ""In summer, you can strip down only so much,"" she says. ""But in winter, you can layer and stay comfortable no matter what the weather brings."""	1
"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have been romantically linked since the year 2009 when they met while filming 'The Last Song.' The couple only confirmed their relationship in the year 2010 when they made their red carpet debut at an Oscar event. However, according to reports, the couple has split up for the second time, and we are really hoping that the reports are not true. The couple has been through so much together, and it would be unfortunate if these reports end up being true.  As reported by RadarOnline, an insider shared, ""They’ve been hanging by a thread for months. Now they’re as good as broken up and there will be no wedding."" It is also believed that the 'Hannah Montana' star left the couple's Malibu house without her engagement ring. ""Miley’s been spending a lot more time at her parents’ house. She needs time to herself,"" the source continued.  The 'Wrecking Ball' singer had been under a lot of pressure lately because of the wedding planning work and is now beginning to rethink her commitment to the 'Hunger Games' actor. ""She’s accomplished a lot in her life, but there’s still a lot she wants to do — and Miley doesn’t want to have to answer to anybody, least of all a husband,"" the insider went on to add.  On the 17th of June, Miley and Liam were photographed looking extremely miserable during a family gathering with Miley's parents for Father's Day. Recently, the couple was seen in the parking lot of the 'Nobu' restaurant, and it was evident that she was not wearing her ring. An onlooker shared, ""Things were really tense between Miley and Liam. They looked like they wanted to be anywhere but with each other.""  According to reports, Cyrus seems to have gotten cold feet and is dragging them for quit some time time, and Liam is supposedly very fed up with her endless days. ""Liam’s over it. He wants kids and doesn’t want to keep putting it off. It’s ultimatum time for Liam and pals aren’t betting on Miley making the commitment he wants!"" the source added.  The pair initially decided to get engaged in the year 2012 but chose to call it off in the year 2013. In September 2013, Miley's representative confirmed that the engagement had been called off. Liam was seen making out with Mexican actress and singer Eiza Gonzalez.  A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Mar 4, 2018 at 8:36pm PST  In the month of December that same year, Miley revealed what life after her relationship with Liam Hemsworth looked like and said, ""This is the best time of my life. I'm not going to look back on it and be like, 'I wish I hadn't been dwelling over a breakup,' you know? Because that's not what God wants my life to be about right now."" Around three years later, the pair chose to get back and Miley was seen sporting her engagement ring.  On an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Miley revealed, ""It's very weird because this is, like, real jewelry, and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy. They don't look that good together because they kind of mix up."" Miley also went on to add, ""Sometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune, and he's kind of like, ""What's going on?"" And I'm like, ""This isn't really my aesthetic, but I'll wear it because you love me."" Miley said that her wedding ""has to be perfect"" and ""has to be like a soundtrack in a movie.""  Around the time when the couple announced their engagement, Miley spoke to People and shared, ""I'm so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with Liam."" During the year 2017, Miley told the Sun that she does not have plans to get married any time soon and shared, ""I don't envision marriage. I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married].""  ""Three years ago, if you’d asked me if I’d be here, this happy with this man, I’d have been stunned. I’m just riding this out. In some relationships, you lose yourself by being with someone else. Actually, it made me find myself more. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it’s possible to get even happier, I’ll take it,"" Miley added.  During the same interview, she also spoke about her relationship with Liam after they decided to split up.  A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on May 7, 2018 at 5:05pm PDT  ""I didn’t know [we’d get back together]. I’m so crazy I have no idea. But I had something in my heart, it never felt like it was really over. We kept a great friendship really private. It’s good for people to have that space to grow individually. Otherwise, when you’re with someone from 16 until 24, you grow into the same person,"" she revealed.  The couple attended the 'Thor: Ragnarok' premiere together to support Hemsworth's brother, Chris Hemsworth and the couple seemed like they were going strong and were in it for the long run. There were many rumors which stated that the couple had secretly decided to get married in April 2017 but Chris Hemsworth flatly denied the rumors during an interview with SiriusXM's Sway in the Morning in January of 2018."	1
With just weeks to go before Kate Middleton gives birth to her third child, her future sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, is already thinking about her own royal baby!  While touring the campus of Northern Ireland’s next-generation science park on Friday with fiancé Prince Harry, the couple met a husband and wife team who make innovative and hypoallergenic baby products.  Pointing to the products from Shnuggle, Meghan said: “I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”  PA Images/Sipa USA  Chris Jackson/Pool/Getty  The products on display included a baby bath that allows the baby to sit up, a changing mat and a Moses basket.  “It’s very sweet,” Meghan said.  Sinead Murphy, who founded the company with her husband Adam, told reporters, “They seemed very engaged with the products. Harry was particularly interested in the bath. I wonder if he has witnessed bath time with his nephew or niece.”  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle then visited the Belfast campus of Northern Ireland’s next generation science park, @CatalystIncHQ, to meet some of Northern Ireland's brightest young entrepreneurs and innovators. pic.twitter.com/OUgBw4FUDE — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 23, 2018  “As soon as he saw the bum bump [which stops the baby from slipping down] he understood immediately,” she continued. “He said, ‘Oh, non-slip.’ ”  Can’t get enough of PEOPLE’s Royals coverage?

Harry can’t resist sharing a special moment with little ones at royal events — and the feeling is mutual. He also supports several charities that work to better the lives of children all over the world.  Charles McQuillan/Getty  Meghan has also proven she has a way with children. She has traveled to Rwanda to work on behalf of kids. And she regularly posted sweet snaps hanging out with her friends’ kids during her downtime.

The palace shared a few new details about the upcoming royal wedding on Thursday, including that around 600 invitations are now on their way to lucky guests in the mail!	1
Kim Kardashian recently revealed that she and hubby, Kanye West, would like to have more children so that daughter North and son Saint will grow up with lots of siblings.  However, the 36-year-old’s first two pregnancies caused significant damage to her uterus and now she’s unable to conceive naturally. Even after a risky surgery to repair the damage, doctors were unable to mend the problem, so now the celebrity couple must look into other options.  On Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the reality star revealed that she’s been “begging” her younger sister Khloe to be her surrogate.  It’s a big ask for anyone, but considering that Khloe has no children of her own yet, we wonder how she’d feel about giving birth to her sister’s child.  If Khloe’s not willing, then it seems the siblings’ mum would be, with Kris Jenner telling Kim “I would do it in two seconds” in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  Whatever happens, Kim seems determined to have baby number three, so we’ve no doubt she’ll keep exploring her options.  In other news, the reality star recently celebrated her third wedding anniversary with Kanye. The couple kept things low-key, by taking their daughter North to Disneyland in Anaheim for the day.

"While the title of Most Iconic American Horror Story Character is hotly contested, there's no competition when it comes to the most GIF-ed. Emma Roberts' Madison Montgomery might have died at the end of the third season, Coven, but her profile's only grown over these past four years thanks to ""Surprise, bitch."" And earlier this month, Roberts confirmed her return to the AHS fold for the upcoming eighth season, Apocalypse.  Given that Apocalypse is the long-awaited Murder House/Coven crossover, Roberts' presence makes sense, and today on Instagram she shared the first actual image of Madison on the Murder House set.  EW notes that Madison is standing in the spot where the gazebo once stood, after Ben (Dylan McDermott) built it to cover the evidence of Hayden's (Kate Mara) corpse. McDermott and Connie Britton are confirmed to return as Ben and Vivien, while Jessica Lange will also reprise her Season 1 role of Constance, making her first appearance on the show since Season 4, Freak Show.  Apocalypse is shaping up to be an all-star season, with a returning cast that also includes Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Kathy Bates, Adina Porter, Cheyenne Jackson, Frances Conroy, Billy Eichner, Gabourey Sidibe, Leslie Grossman, Billie Lourd, Lily Rabe, and Stevie Nicks. Cody Fern, who was a standout in the Ryan Murphy-produced The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, is also joining the show in the role of grown-up demon spawn Michael Langdon.  Producer Alexis Martin Woodall has said the story “begins with the end of the world—and then our world begins... It starts in the real world. It’s very tangible, and it’s a familiar panic.” Creator Ryan Murphy stated that the show takes place in the near future. You can read more details about Apocalypse over here.

"Karrueche Tran Judge Grants 5 Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  Karrueche Tran Granted Five Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  EXCLUSIVE  12:01 PM PT -- The judge just sided with Tran ... ordering the restraining order stay in place for the next 5 years. Chris Brown threatened violence against his ex-GF after they broke up, demanding she give back money and gifts he had given her during their relationship ... this according to Karrueche Tran's in-person testimony in court.  Karrueche took the stand Thursday in her restraining order case against Chris, telling a judge after she broke up with the singer ... he demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned. When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.  Karrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.""  She claims he also texted her more violent threats like ... ""I can get my money back and I'm tired of playing games"" as well as ""Bitch I will beat the s**t out of you"" and ""I promise you I will make your life hell."" She says he also once wrote ""Imma kill blood"" under a photo of her and actor Michael B. Jordan.  Karrueche also testified that Chris had beaten her before.  Chris Brown's attorney, David Gammill, grilled Karrueche on cross-examination, and pressed her on allegedly taunting Chris about the rings by saying she had sold them. Karrueche told Gammill she never planned to return the rings because they were hers. Gammill also brought up the point of Karrueche never reporting any of the alleged behavior to authorities.  Karrueche insists she fears for her safety and needs permanent protection. Chris wasn't in court today and the judge refused to let him join the hearing via phone."	1

Crafty Katie Holmes is throwing some backhanded shade on ex-husband Tom Cruise and Scientology, RadarOnline.com has learned, by parading her romance with Jamie Foxx and lauding psychological therapy — which the church disdains.  “Katie says therapy is the ONLY thing that saved her and daughter Suri from her suffocating marriage to Tom and the clutches of the church,” a source revealed to RadarOnline.com exclusively. “Now she wants to pass on the benefit of her experience to help other women who’ve weathered similar nightmares.”  Though Holmes, 38, escaped Cruise (and Scientology) in 2012, she’s determined to continue being an advocate of therapy. So it may be no surprise that her next role is in the adaptation of the best-selling self-help book “The Secret.”  PHOTOS: Katie Holmes Through the Years  “Katie hopes to use the film to become a self-help guru and completely defy Scientology’s views of therapy,” said the source.  The actress had refused offers to write an explosive tell-all about her stifling marriage to Tom and the iron fist of the church. But she’s finally gone public with the worst-kept secret relationship ever — her romance with Cruise’s longtime pal Foxx — and is now happy to show it off to the world.  “She loves the fact this will be the ultimate slap in Tom’s face!”  We pay for juicy info!

We can hope that Mueller is playing some sort of long ended chess game, but I'm ready for Trump and his entire cabinet out yesterday and I just have to accept that he'll finish his first term and then we'll have to deal with Ivanka running in another election cycle or two.    Betsy on the other hand, Congress APPROVED her, that's how horrific our entire system is.

I feel like a lot of the people who wear their ignorance as a badge of honor are also ones who grew up poor and actually did fight their way to stability - not even wealth, just stability - by working their asses off at a time when working your way to the top was more possible than it is now. They did it without a college education so obviously college is just a scam and a waste, right?? And flat-out refuse to see that a) the world doesn't work that way anymore, b) education is vital now, and c) THEY ALSO GOT REALLY FRUCKING LUCKY Reply  Parent  Thread    Link  My friend and I were talking about this last week. She thinks that as more and more people (POC, women, WOC, those from low income backgrounds) are getting educated, for some people, education is becoming less and less valued. I might take it a step further and suggest it's because they want to show they're better than the groups I just named.

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage — and seven years as a couple.  “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ”  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.  Pharrell and Jennifer Aniston at Ellen DeGeneres' birthday.  The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also had a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin’ in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.  On Saturday, Aniston made an appearance at Ellen DeGeneres‘ birthday party without Theroux. She was spotted standing outside the Hollywood venue chatting with Pharrell.  The next day, the actress rang in her 49th birthday without the actor. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering including pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday.  Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. (Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends).  Justin Theroux walks his dog in N.Y.C. days before Jennifer Aniston's birthday. Splash News Online  Sources recently told PEOPLE that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  “Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”  Aniston showed off the $21 million L.A. home they designed together in the March issue of Architectural Digest, saying, “I look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there’s nowhere else I want to be.”  Aniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008’s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 — just a few days before Theroux’s 44th birthday. A source close to the actress told PEOPLE at the time that the two were happy to have pulled off the surprise wedding, inviting friends to a backyard party under the ruse of celebrating Theroux’s birthday.  RELATED: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Were the Picture Perfect Couple During Their Last Vacation  “They seemed ecstatic,” the source said. “They celebrated late and barely slept, but they were in the best mood. They were giddy to have pulled off an amazing wedding celebration with their friends. And they were proud to finally be married.”  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 after starting their relationship in 1998. She later dated Vince Vaughn and John Mayer after her divorce from Pitt.  This is Theroux’s first marriage after previously dating hair stylist Heidi Bivens for 14 years before their breakup in 2011, shortly before he started dating Aniston. Theroux and Bivens shared an apartment in New York City before the split.	1

Gilbert met husband Nunes while traveling through Italy, India and Bali after the unraveling of her first marriage – a trip that inspired the 2006 hit memoir, which has gone on to sell more than 10 million copies. Eat, Pray, Love was also adapted for the big screen in 2010, with Julia Roberts as Gilbert.  “I loved you so much, Rayya. Thank you for letting me walk with you right to edge of the river.

I will always love you.”  Elizabeth Gilbert/Twitter  In June 2017, Gilbert and Elias celebrated their love with a “simple and spontaneous ceremony of love.”  Elias detailed her life as a gay Middle Eastern woman whose family moved to the U.S. at 8-years-old in 1968 in her 2013 memoir, Harley Loco: A Memoir of Hard Living, Hair and Post-Punk, in which she also recalled her time as a homeless woman, prison inmate and drug addict.	0
Getty  Since welcoming twins Ella and Alexander last June, George has gushed about parenthood and the 'love you gain' after having children.  He said 'when you have children of your own, you realise you are responsible for their lives in a way you haven't been before, and you become conscious that you want to make an example of your own life that they will follow.'  However, Star claims that George is not taking his role as a father seriously enough.  'Amal has told him over and over not to ride scooters, but he refuses!' says the source, who adds that she 'blew up at him after the accident but he kind of smiled and shrugged it off.'  The source claims that while Amal was by George's side shortly after the accident, helping him onto a private plane leaving Sardinia, she's since left - and has taken the twins with her.  'She's telling friends she hopes the absence helps make him see things her way.'  'Amal is pretty clear about what she expects from George as a father and a husband,' says an insider, who adds that while Amal hasn't filed divorce papers, she's 'privately consulted a lawyer', Star's source explosively alleges.  George and Amal are yet to respond to Star's report.	1
Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.

"One of the first things you probably asked yourself as soon as you started watching Netflix Original Altered Carbon was, would you resleeve if you could? To live forever - or at least avoid death until you are ready - sounds good on paper, but if sci-fi has taught us anything, it's to be careful what you wish for.  I couldn't help but ask the Altered Carbon cast if they'd considered the same question when I sat down with them to talk about the series recently, and I was surprised that their answers were more complex than a simple yes or no. Playing these roles has obviously bought out their inner philosophers...  Big Questions 10 questions I have after watching Altered Carbon  ""I’m not convinced by the whole immortality thing,"" says James Purefoy, who plays Laurens Bancroft, ""I think that way a lot of problems lie."" Star of the show Joel Kinnaman agrees with the message of Altered Carbon, that cheating death would be bad for humanity, but personally, he'd go for it! ""It probably wouldn't be good for society as a whole, but if you gave me as an individual the opportunity to continue to live, I would take it. It’s very hard to turn that down,"" he told me.  Of course, living forever isn't the only possibility being resleeved offers... you could also be resleeved into someone else entirely and find out what it was like to be a world-renowned boxer or a millionaire for a day. When asked who'd she'd most like to be resleeved as, Renee Elise Goldsberry, who plays Quellcrist Falconer, didn't hesitate. “I think I would enjoy being Michelle Obama,"" the actress says. ""I’d like to know how it felt in that world to be inside a women that actually is as powerful as some of the women I play."" Good answer.  Watch our interview above for the cast's full answers on whether they'd be resleeved or not, and who'd they'd be resleeved as if they could (Kinnaman is a basketball fan!), or for more Altered Carbon insights and revelations, here's what the series has in common with Doctor Who according to its star."	0
"Getty Images  The 'Bodak Yellow' rapper was the belle of the Grammy ball  Cardi B, Literal Angel, Lived Her Best Life At The Grammys  New York's own Cardi B stepped onto the 2018 Grammy red carpet looking like a real-life angel descended from heaven — wings and everything! It's not like we would expect anything less from the Bronx rapper. After the monumental year she's had, it's only appropriate that she would #bless us all at the music industry's biggest and most star-studded night.  But Cardi's reign didn't stop at the red carpet. Although the ""Bodak Yellow"" rapper lost Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance to hip-hop titan Kendrick Lamar, she won our hearts — and, more importantly, the admiration of her peers (and Bono!). From a fire performance of ""Finesse"" with Bruno Mars to a statement-making debut at Madison Square Garden, Cardi was the belle of the ball. And reminded us all that her Cinderella story is only just beginning.  Let's take a look at some of Cardi's best moments from the night. Okurrr!"	0

Carnahan, who served as creator and writer for Courteney Cox‘s Dirt and recently worked on Don Cheadle‘s House of Lies, has a 20-year-old son, Emmett, from a previous relationship.	0
"There's nothing quite as exhilarating as the early stages of a . Just the thought that you may have found your one-and-only can be so thrilling. But, the early stages of falling in love can be as frustrating as they are wonderful. Your new love life may consume your energy, focus, and time to the point where everything else going on in your life may feel like a rude intrusion. You can't stop thinking about your lover. You get up and go to obsessing about the relationship and what your future will look like together.  To some of you, this reaction to love may seem over board. But, many of you know first-hand how falling in love can turn you into an obsessed, needy, and insecure person for a time. You don't have to have from the past to feel this way. Of course, if you do, this stage will be particularly difficult for you.  Remember, the saying is not staying balanced in love, it is falling, losing your self to love. So, if you are in the early stages of falling in love right now, and you feel a little crazy, don't worry, you kind of are. You are under the influence of your that are making you feel, all at once, euphoric, endangered, and exhausted. Let's call these the Three E's of falling in love. Researcher Donatella Marazziti of the University of Pisa, Italy helps us to understand the euphoria we feel in the early stages of romantic love. She says, it is more than two hearts igniting, when people fall in love. Their hormones ignite as well. The nerve transmitters adrenaline and phenylethylamine (PEA-also present in chocolate) increase when two people are attracted to each other that puts them in emotional overdrive. Additionally, the relaxation, feel good hormone serotonin lowers, causing you to obsess about your lover and consistently reflect back on the romantic times spent with him or her.  Falling in love produces a biological state that is a high similar to being on . More interestingly, Donatella Marazziti discovered that falling in love also alters levels in men and women. This is the male hormone that makes men hunters and gatherers and more able than women to be sexual without an emotional commitment. Increased testosterone levels in women during the early stages of romantic love make them more sexual and aggressive. While decreased testosterone levels in men make them more emotional and receptive at this time. This finding makes me smile. I have heard more than one man say through the years, ""What happened to her sex drive? When we first went out, she was sexually wild? I couldn't keep up with her. She tricked me."" If you yourself have felt this way about your female lover, now, you know that it was her hormones that made her into a girl gone wild.  Why can love's early stages make you feel personally endangered as well? First, the euphoria that you feel can disorganize you. You are adding a relationship to your normal, busy routine. Your normal responsibilities at work and home may fall to the wayside, as you put more energy into solidifying your love relationship. This can make you more anxious than normal. Also, loving asks you to lower your defenses and loosen up your personal boundaries so that you can merge your needs and desires with those of your lover. This process can be threatening and make you feel unsafe. Nonetheless, this is the making of a strong, healthy relationship . It takes time to trust each other and to know that this attachment will not hurt you. No wonder we can feel anxious and unsafe when we first fall in love. There's much to gain and to lose, in the process. The you feel is palpable. Many of you may unconsciously create emotional issues and dramas to give voice, and make tangible, the endangerment that you feel.  With all of the hormone changes and fears going on inside of you, it is no wonder you may feel exhausted in the early stages of falling in love. I've heard several people say that they can't wait until the honeymoon period is over so that they can get some rest. It's no wonder that some of you may rush to seal the relationship deal, just to put an end to these uncomfortable feelings.  Knowledge is Power  Hardy persons arm themselves with knowledge. They approach new experiences as a chance to learn something new about themselves (the hardy attitude of challenge), and learn what they can to cope effectively with stressful situations (the hardy attitude of control). Indeed, the early stages of falling in love are stressful. The following recommendations will help you to navigate the falling in love stage more smoothly, so that you can treasure this very special time in your life.  Enjoy the high, but don't lose yourself in it. Keep your schedule, no matter how much you want to throw it over. Acknowledge you are under the influence of some powerful hormones. Get the , rest and relaxation that you need to stay physically, emotionally, and mentally sound. When concerns and fears come into your mind about your lover, ask yourself if you are just trying to discharge the that you feel about the unknown, so that you can stop a personal drama in its track. Don't rush to seal the relationship, just because you can't stand the anxiety of having to go through the stages of falling in love. Accept your anxiety and learn to work with it. Research shows that falling in love also makes you more creative (Scientific American, Does Falling In Love Make Us More Creative?). So, work out that anxiety and fear through some creative activities. Don't lower your defenses, personal boundaries, and expectations to the extent that you are denying what you really desire and need. This never works out well. You want to build an authentic relationship attachment, rather than one based on fantasy alone.  You will handle this wonderful time much better just by knowing what I've shared with you today about the process. Accept the process and let love unfold in its natural way.

Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!	1

ABC has ordered a second season of hit singing competition series American Idol, with Ryan Seacrest and judges Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie set to return.  American Idol, once the biggest show on television during its heyday on Fox, has not been a runaway ratings hit in its return. The ABC incarnation posted a series of ratings declines after the premiere and hit multiple franchise all-time lows before recently rebounding with the start of the live shows. It also was regularly topped by rival NBC singling competition The Voice on Monday. Still, American Idol is on track to finish as Sunday’s No. 1 entertainment broadcast series on each of its 8 telecasts this season in Live + Same Day Adults 18-49. On average, the series ranks No. 1 in its 2-hour slot with Adults 18-49, Adults 18-34, across all key Women and Teens 12-17.  “We knew that American Idol on ABC would unleash an opportunity for singers from all walks of life to realize their dreams and that these incredible contestants would have America rooting for their success,” said Channing Dungey, president, ABC Entertainment. “I am thrilled that Katy, Luke, Lionel and Ryan will be back to once again embark on this Idol journey with us to discover the next crop of inspiring talent.”  ABC’s pickup of the singing competition ended a long saga of getting American Idol back on TV when the network closed a deal last year with FremantleMedia North America and CORE Media Group’s 19 Entertainment for a revival, two seasons after it ended its 15-season run on Fox. ABC then spent reported $20 million to lock in Perry as a judge.  “American Idol’’s return on ABC has shown once again that viewers love to discover and support raw talent,” said Trish Kinane, president of Entertainment Programming, FremantleMedia North America, executive producer and showrunner of American Idol. “Our new judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have brought huge credibility, energy and fun to the show this year, and we are so excited to continue the journey with Ryan Seacrest at the helm in the search for the next superstar.”  Idol’s relaunch on ABC was overshadowed by the sexual harassment allegations against Seacrest that resurfaces in the week leading to the show’s debut. ABC has stood by the veteran Idol host.  The top 7 finalists take the stage this Sunday in the live coast-to-coast broadcast at 8:00-10:00 p.m. EDT/7:00-9:00 p.m. CDT/5:00-7:00 p.m. PDT. (The episode will be rebroadcast for the West Coast at 8:00-10:00 p.m. PDT).	0

"Since his firing from the Today show last November for what NBC News chairman Andy Lack called ""inappropriate sexual behavior,"" Matt Lauer has reportedly spent his days holed up in his $33-million Hamptons house, where he's been staying quiet and ""focused on family.""  But he seems to think a career comeback is possible. According to Page Six, Lauer told fans this week that he'll ""be back on TV.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  ""A group of older ladies came over to Lauer, saying, ‘We miss you!’ ” a source told the publication. Lauer reportedly replied, ""I’ve been busy being a dad. But don’t worry, I’ll be back on TV.""  The disgraced former anchor was also recently spotted with his his soon-to-be ex-wife Annette Roque in Bridgehampton.  Page Six reports that Lauer will pay Annette Roque up to $20 million in a divorce. A source also tells the publication that the couple is separating amicably.  “Things really have settled down,"" the source says. ""Matt and Annette are getting on and they’re both spending time with their kids. They hope to settle the divorce very soon.”    That's a marked difference from rumors earlier this year that Lauer was ""furious"" about the terms of the separation.  ""Matt is furious he is essentially handing over half of his net worth to Annette,"" a source told Us Weekly earlier this year. ""He could fight for a better deal in court but that would only result in dragging this out longer and negative headlines. He is ready to move on with his life and truly believes that a television comeback is possible.""  At the time, the source also told the magazine, ""Roque will receive the [family's] horse farm, their current residence and a one-time payment of $25 million.""  Earlier this month, Lauer was spotted paddleboarding in Sag Harbor at a charity event, just days before news broke that he had sold his Upper East Side apartment for above its $7.35 million asking price.  According to Variety, which first shared news of the sale, Lauer bought the property in August of 2004 for ""a smidgen more than $5.882 million.""    July  In July, Lauer broke his silence in an interview with Radio New Zealand about the ongoing battle over public access to the 16,000-acre, $9.2-million ranch there for which he purchased a lease last year. Known as Hunter Valley Station, the ranch is the only thoroughfare to Hawea Conservation Park.

Getty Images Chanachai Panichpattanakij / Moment  The New Zealand government’s Walking Access Commission wants to offer hikers and hunters more access to Lauer's property to get to the park, but the New York Times reports that the disgraced TV star wants ""hundreds of thousands"" of dollars, ""if not more,"" if he is forced to allow greater access to a 25-mile gravel road that passes through the property.  Lauer told Radio New Zealand that the groups seeking an easement on his property are ""taking advantage of some difficult times I've been through over the past six months"" and added, ""I think they see me as an easy mark.""  June  Matt Lauer on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in the Hamptons on June 7 MATT AGUDO/INSTARimages.com  In early June, Lauer dined with Today veteran Deborah Kosofsky at the East Pole, Page Six reports, and the two reportedly discussed his ""summer plans"" and a potential trip from his longtime home of the Hamptons ""to the mountains."" He could also head to the farm in New Zealand, which authorities determined he would be allowed to keep after the country launched an investigation into whether he had violated its ""good character"" condition for foreign landowners.  May  Although Lauer has been staying largely silent since the news of his firing broke last fall, the former anchor issued a statement in May in response to a report NBCUniversal released following its internal investigation into the misconduct allegations that cost him his job. In a statement to Variety, Lauer said he was fired after ""admitting to past relationships with co-workers,"" but expressed his disagreement with ""certain aspects"" of the report.    ""There are aspects of the NBC report with which I clearly disagree. However, I spent 25 wonderful years at the network, 20 of those at Today, and I’m extremely proud of what we accomplished as a team. On November 29, 2017, I was terminated by NBC after admitting to past relationships with co-workers. A day later I took responsibility for those relationships, apologized to the people I hurt and promised to begin the process of repairing the damage I had caused my family,"" Lauer said. ""I have worked every day since then to honor that promise.""

I remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost. But defending my family now requires me to speak up.""  ""I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.""  Ann Curry on Matt Lauer  The 60-year-old's former co-host, Ann Curry, also spoke to the Washington Post. Curry said that in 2012, a female staffer confided she had been ""sexually harassed physically"" by Lauer. ""A woman approached me and asked me tearfully if I could help her,"" Curry told the Post. ""She was afraid of losing her job ... I believed her.""  Matt Lauer and Ann Curry attend the Today 60th anniversary celebration in New York City on January 12, 2012. Getty Images  Curry said she went to NBC executives and, keeping the staffer's name private at her request, ""told management they had a problem and they needed to keep an eye on [Lauer] and how he deals with women.""  Lauer and Curry reportedly had a rocky relationship (""I can't believe I am sitting next to this woman,"" he once told an assistant, according to New York magazine), and her tearful sign-off from the show in 2012 included a particularly awkward kiss from Lauer.    Lauer's Relationship with his Today Colleagues  Lauer's replacement on the show, Hoda Kotb, seems to have a friendlier relationship with the former anchor though. In an early April interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Kotb said, ""We keep in touch with him. I mean, look, this is one of those complex situations. I’ve known him since I started working at NBC [in 1998].""    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  ""When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call,"" Kotb added. ""He helps and helped in ways that . . . you know, he was incredible in that way. There is that Matt and then there’s the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers' voices matter, and that story matters.""  Lauer's wife Annette Roque  In January, the Post reported that Lauer's wife of almost two decades, Annette Roque, ""forced him out of the Hamptons estate they shared with their three kids."" The newspaper now says his marriage to Roque is ""over.""  Matt Lauer in Sag Harbor on January 22 Splash News  Lauer could have moved to another home he owns in Sag Harbor, with gardens by landscape architect Miranda Brooks and interiors by Muriel Brandolini, which has been on the market and got a price reduction in early March. First listed for $14.9 million, the six-bedroom home's asking price was reduced to $12.75 million, a chop of more than $2 million as the Daily Mail first reported. The 6,000-square foot house, built by architect Daniel Romualdez, sits on 25 acres, and the property also includes a heated pool and Har-Tru tennis court.  Lauer listed his four-bedroom New York City apartment on March 30, and it went into contract a month later. Stribling  Lauer and Roque's main house had been Richard Gere's former home, Strongheart Manor, which they reportedly paid $36 million to purchase in 2013. The estate sits on 6.3 acres on the peninsula of North Haven near Sag Harbor and has 12 bedrooms."	1
"Dane Cook and his girlfriend, singer Kelsi Taylor, had no issue showing major PDA during a romantic getaway to Maui!  Cook, 45, and Taylor, 19, were recently snapped kissing on the beach, where the couple enjoyed some fun in the sun. Taylor showed off her fit physique in an orange bikini, while Cook went shirtless in a pair of board shorts.  Backgrid  Cook and Taylor have been dating since last year. The two arrived in Hawaii on Thursday, according to Taylor's Instagram, and aside from hanging out on the beach, have also found time to work out together.  Cook hasn't been shy about his lady love, sharing a photo of the two holding hands while on vacation.  This isn't the first time Cook has been linked to a younger woman. In September 2015, Us Weekly reported that Cook was""hooking up"" with Miley Cyrus, who was 22 at the time while he was 43.

"Over 2,665 days ago, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were spotted—arm in arm—at a Philadelphia IHOP. And so began the long, complicated, and endless saga of “Jelena,” which, in its latest of many twists, has the on-again, off-again couple once again hitting the “off“ switch.  How did we get here, exactly? You’re forgiven for not knowing. After all, IHOP was centuries ago, or at least 2010, when Barack Obama was a first-term president and America watched American Idol and Survivor. Here’s a comprehensive guide to their on-and-off, up-and-down, are-they-or-aren’t-they relationship.  December 2010—The Infamous IHOP Date  TMZ breaks the news that the teen idols enjoyed a “cuddly” date at an IHOP in Philadelphia ahead of a Q102’s Jingle Ball. Gomez tells Us Weekly that it was platonic, and that Bieber is “one of my best friends . . . It was just pancakes!”  Bieber, too, stays mum on the subject, telling MTV that she’s “an amazing person,” but, “I think that people are always gonna be interested in my personal life . . . but I gotta keep some things to myself. I’m just having fun being a teenager.”  January 2011—The New Year’s Weekend Kiss  With dating rumors swirling, paparazzi pictures catch the then 16- and 18-year-olds kissing on a yacht in St. Lucia, essentially proving what fans already suspected—they’re an item.  February 2011—The Big Debut  At the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, the teen-dream couple made their red carpet debut together, thereby confirming their relationship. They even take some lovey-dovey pictures in the photo booth.  May 2011—Young and (Visibly) in Love  After a glamorous appearance at the Billboard Music Awards, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez jet off to Maui, Hawaii. Photographers catch them canoodling in the ocean–Gomez noticeably rocking some statement hoops—and the photos go viral.  September 2011—The Staples Center Date  Here we reach peak Jelena—reports surface that Bieber rented the entire Staples Center arena so he and his lady love could watch Titanic, alone. “Romance isn’t dead,” Bieber tweeted. “Treat your lady right fellas.”  November 2011—Baby Mama Drama  A storm brews in paradise as a woman accuses Bieber of fathering her child. After a paternity test, the case is thrown out.  December 2011–October 2012—All Is . . . Well?  For the next 10 months, all seems content on the Jelena front. They’re spotted at a Lakers game, on a helicopter ride, at the Teen Choice Awards, and celebrating her birthday. But some tabloid sites start alleging that the two may not be as solid as people think.  November 2012—The First Split  Bieber and Gomez break up for the first time. Conflicting schedules, trust issues, and their young ages are all rumored to be causes of the demise.  April 2013—Hidden Lyrics?  Although the two aren’t together, and despite the fact that Gomez tells Ryan Seacrest “it’s not really about a specific person,” fans theorize that her new song “Come & Get It,” with lyrics like “Can’t stop because I love it, hate the way I love you / All day all night, maybe I’m addicted for life, no lie,” is about Bieber.  Fuel is added to the fire when Bieber allegedly posts—and then quickly deletes—an Instagram with Gomez.  But at the end of 2013, Bieber admits the two aren’t speaking, although he still loves her.  2014—Are They or Aren’t They?  2014, to put it lightly, was a confusing year in the Jelena timeline. First of all, it’s the year that Bieber’s image goes full-on bad boy—after bizarre incidents in 2013, like peeing in a bucket and losing custody of his monkey—he gets in real, tangible trouble. In January alone, he’s arrested for drunk driving, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license, and he was also accused of vandalism for egging his neighbors. (January isn’t great for Gomez, either, who checks into rehab.) The tabloids viciously suggest it’s because of Bieber and/or a drug problem, but a frustrated Gomez later tells GQ that it was to seek help for lupus.  But before the rehab and before the DUI, the couple is spotted riding Segways in Calabasas, California. Throughout the year, and all the drama, the “maybe dates” continue: a Starbucks run in Texas and a day at the zoo. Then, the Instagram—Bieber posts (and also deletes) a bunch of pictures of his former beau, including one that calls their love “unconditional.”  But concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones . . . with Bieber and other women. He’s associated with a slew of models, up-and-coming actresses, and other beauties—including Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who Gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on Instagram, and she also unfollowed Bieber.  Then there’s the international incident in July 2014, when Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber get into fist fight, allegedly over Gomez.  In November, Gomez releases “The Heart Wants What It Wants,” which she suggests is about Bieber. She gives an emotional performance of the song at the American Music Awards, which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course. That same month, Bieber unfollows her on Instagram. In December, he posts a picture of himself with Hailey Baldwin, but in the caption says he’s “super single.”  2015—Are They or Aren’t They? (Part Two)  We’re entering the second of the lost Jelena years, where no one knows quite what’s going on, perhaps not even the Bieber and Gomez themselves.  After being spotted holding hands at a Golden Globes party, Gomez and Zedd enjoy a brief romance. Zedd admits two years later to Billboard that he wasn’t ready to date an international superstar like Gomez: “Reporters were calling my parents. People were hacking my friends’ phones. I was pissed. [Though] I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,” he said.  Bieber continues to post throwback pictures of Gomez on Instagram, confusing just about everyone—including Drake. Reconciliation rumors ramp up after he tells Ellen DeGeneres that a number of songs on his new album Purpose are about Gomez, and a video surfaces of Bieber serenading her with “My Girl” at a hotel in Beverly Hills.  But Gomez makes it clear she’s sick of being defined by their relationship. In her cover story with Elle, she says her November 2014 AMA performance was her personal life swan song. “Everybody was talking about the same thing: my relationship,” she remembers. “I was so exhausted. I said, ‘I want this [performance] to be the last time I have to talk about this. And acknowledge this feeling.’ ”  Early 2016—Here We Go Again  In January 2016, Justin Bieber posts steamy pictures with Hailey Baldwin in St. Barth’s, which many take to mean they are dating. The speculation increases when Baldwin makes a cameo in Bieber’s GQ cover story. He describes her as “someone I really love. We spend a lot of time together.”  However, Baldwin later tells Marie Claire that they weren’t ever official. “We are not an exclusive couple. He’s about to go on tour,” she said. “Relationships at this age are already complicated, but I don’t really like to talk about it because it’s between me and him.”  Bieber posts a throwback picture of him and Gomez kissing, and she comments “perfect.”  August 2016—Full-Out War  Although claiming they’re just friends, Bieber posts a series of Instagrams with Sofia Richie. However, after backlash from fans, Bieber posted “I’m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don’t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn’t be so mean to people that I like.”  Gomez responded in the comments section: “If you can’t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol—it should be special between you two only. Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you.”  That, allegedly, kicked off a full-on Instagram war between the couple, involving many comments, including cheating accusations on both sides, which are now said to be deleted. Gomez later takes to her Snapchat to say that what she did was “selfish and pointless.” Bieber deletes his Instagram.  A few months later, it's reported that Gomez cut her Revival Tour short to seek treatment at a facility in Tennessee. “My self-esteem was shot. I was depressed, anxious. I started to have panic attacks right before getting onstage, or right after leaving the stage. Basically I felt I wasn’t good enough, wasn’t capable,” she later told Vogue.  January 2017—New Beginnings  Gomez begins to date The Weeknd.  May 2017—Fashionable Debuts  Gomez and The Weeknd hit the red carpet couple together at the 2017 Met Gala.  September 2017—Health Scares  Gomez reveals on Instagram that she underwent a kidney transplant. (The donor was her friend Francia Raisa.)  October 2017—Reunited Again  Bieber and Gomez are seen hanging out together again, but multiple sources say it’s just as friends. Allegedly, their church, Hillsong, as well as Gomez’s kidney transplant caused to two to reconnect. And The Weeknd was reportedly fine with it.  However, just about a week after the reports, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd announce their split (although, apparently, Bieber was not the cause).  November 2017—Conscious Re-Coupling  In the weeks following Gomez’s breakup with The Weeknd, she's spotted canoodling with Bieber. . . again and again and again. On November 15, they kiss at his hockey game—fueling tabloid speculation that they are back together and better than ever. A few weeks later, they're seen at the Beverly Hills Montage.  January 2018—Yep, This is a ThingAlthough there is no official statement that they are back on, a flurry of sightings (including a New Year's trip to Los Cabos and joint-gym workout) confirm the inevitable: Jelena is definitely a thing.  February 2018—Going StrongFirst, there's a Valentine’s Day date at the Montage Beverly Hills (is this their spot? It's totally their spot). Then, the duo jet off to Jamaica for Bieber's fathers wedding, providing a much-needed distraction to an otherwise terrible news cycle.  March 2018—Instagram Official  Gomez wishes Bieber a happy birthday on Instagram: ""March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom,"" she writes. March 1 is (yes, you guessed it) the day the Sorry singer was born.  Yet, days later, reports surface that the two are pressing pause on their relationship. But is it a break. . . or a break up?  Perhaps a People anonymous source put it best: “They’ve been having disagreements, but it wouldn’t be surprising if they’re back together in a week.”  Watch Selena Gomez on Family, Obsessions, and Her Go-To Dance Moves:"	1
"It's been nearly a year since Christina and Tarek El Moussa's explosive fight that resulted in the two splitting up, but it appears the Flip or Flop stars are not completely over it.  On Thursday, Tarek posted a photo to his Instagram story of himself posing in front of a sign at BJ's Cabana Bar in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The sign read, ""No guns, weapons of any type."" Tarek added text to the snap, writing ""or helicopters,"" tagging his estranged wife and topping it off with a middle finger emoji.    WATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Exes Tarek v. Christina El Moussa: It's a Battle of the Revenge Bods!  The reality star has since deleted the pic, but judging by what Christina posted to her Instagram on Friday, we imagine she wasn't too happy when she saw it.  The blond beauty shared a photo of the Empire State Building with the quote, ""No time for bullshit when you're building an empire.""  ""True that,"" she captioned it. Only surround yourself with the best ❤""  But that's not all! Tarek even gave the post a ""like.""  A source close to Tarek later told TMZ that his post was supposed to be a joke, and he tagged Christina thinking she would find it funny. The middle finger emoji was reportedly directed at the incident, not his co-star.  On Friday, Tarek tried to clear the air with an Instagram post that read, ""#life is about having #fun and enjoying every #moment....people shouldn't take things so seriously especially JOKES that are meant to be playful and fun...""

It’s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you’re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it’s important to realize that the fight isn’t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That’s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a “threat to national security” in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it’s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about “any and all” files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.”“I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.”Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did “undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.” Due to Soros’s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn’t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It’s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary’s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared “it is the central focus of my life” and “a matter of life and death” to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary’s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying “democracy is now in crisis.” Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn’t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it’s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It’s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for funding protests that have turned violent in the United States. He has been responsible for attempting to control the Democrats through his donations to the Party. This man is a menace to society, and Trump is finally labeling Soros like he should be: a “National Security Threat.”Other nations are starting to do something against Soros as well. Hungary became the first nation to come forward and do what they could to bring down Soros. Hungary said that they will use “all the tools at its disposal” to “sweep out” various NGOs that are tied to Soros. In other words, his wealth won’t be able to influence government positions anymore.Again, Soros has done what he could to help finance and protest against Trump’s inauguration. A report came out that showed he was directly tied to over 50 groups that were set to protest the inauguration of Trump. If he is tied to that many groups, then that is a lot of money invested in people just to protest something.Share this article to show that Trump is finally going to label Soros for what he is, and that is a threat to the security of the United States. Trump was able to do this thanks to Obama’s Executive Order back in 2014. Considering all the damage that Soros has done to the United States through his funding of protests, this was a long time coming.	1
In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)	1
"Camila Cabello Wears Couture and Hangs in Hotel Rooms in Artful 'Never Be the Same' Video  Camila Cabello is not letting up on her insanely content-heavy solo career. The latest release from the singer is an artful and sweetly personal video for her hit “Never Be the Same.”  Through a mix of highly editorial shots juxtaposed against homemade-feeling footage Cabello seems to give all sides of herself in the video. It opens with a shot captured through a film lens as the singer flirts with the camera in a robe in a hotel room -- giving a very retro aesthetic -- before cutting to shots of the singer in debonair couture gowns in modern set ups, including a sun-soaked boulder scene.  The song is the latest single off Cabello's debut album, Camila, which premiered at the top of the Billboard 200 Albums chart when it dropped in January. As for the video, this is actually not the first time the Cuban-American singer has given it the video treatment. In December, she leaked an unofficial homemade video for fans, calling it a ""new year's eve present.""  Check out the latest (most official) ""Never Be the Same"" video below."	0

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense.  “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ‘DEPLORABLES,'” he wrote on on Tuesday night, two days after Sunday’s Primetime Emmy Awards telecast. The President is in New York, staying at Trump Tower, during the United Nations General Assembly.  I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ""DEPLORABLES."" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017  The Emmys, broadcast by CBS, were about on par with last year’s ceremony in terms of total viewers. Sunday’s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016’s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year’s low point of a 2.8.  Host Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump’s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for “The Apprentice.” In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.  According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2013  Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, criticized the “politicized” show for the “sameness” of the attacks on Trump.  Related Rachel Brosnahan on Emmy Win and 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 Trump Names Patrick Shanahan Acting Secretary of Defense, Moves Up Mattis' Departure  “It looks like Americans are tuning out,” she said on “Fox & Friends.”  Then she addressed stars who appeared on the stage. “They want you to stick to your knitting. They want you to stick to the stuff that other people write for you.”  She did, however, praise Sean Spicer for his Emmy cameo, in which he made fun of his own post-inauguration press conference in which he chided the media never its reporting on Trump’s inaugural crowd size. Spicer’s appearance has drawn a backlash from Trump detractors who criticized Colbert and Emmy producers for milking laughs out of a political operative who had been a champion of Trump’s polarizing agenda.  “This is something that folks in Hollywood often lack — which is introspection and good humor,” Conway said of Spicer.  Trump spoke at the UN earlier on Tuesday in a speech in which he said that the U.S. would “totally destroy” North Korea if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies.”"	0
"Good news, DC Comics fans. The first look at Aquaman super-villain Black Manta is a pretty faithful adaptation of the comics.  The upcoming blockbuster, which Warner Bros bosses are already promising will set the DCEU back on the right path, has unveiled three new images ahead of the film's launch later this year.  The first of which is The Greatest Showman and The Handmaid's Tale actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane, a bounty and treasure hunter who uses the alias Black Manta.  Director James Wan describes the live-action version of Black Manta as ""part mercenary but full-time pirate"", which is a pretty spot-on description of the comics version of the character.  Wan also clarifies that although Black Manta has a key role to play in Aquaman, the key conflict will be between Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson).  ""Black Manta is a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,"" he teased.  EW also premiered alternate covers for its upcoming issue that include the first glimpse of Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, the former Queen of Atlantis and mother of Aquaman's bride Mera (Amber Heard), before sharing three stills from the film too.  In this magazine profile, James Wan teases that his underwater world will include a gritty recreation of the infamous Super Friends scene of Aquaman riding a seahorse, juxtaposed with cannibal trench-dwellers, sea dragons and a giant octopus.  ""The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it's like I'm making my own sci-fi fantasy film,"" Wan said. ""This is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.""  Aquaman is released in cinemas on December 14.  Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

Activists have often turned to fashion to heighten moments of protest. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, women flooded Washington wearing pink pussycat hats to march on the Capitol. In September, celebrities made a political statement at the 2017 Emmys by wearing blue ACLU ribbons after Trump announced his plans to end DACA.  But perhaps this year’s Golden Globes could thread Hollywood’s largest display of solidarity as some of the biggest names in show business pledge to don black at the 75th annual event.  With the influx of sexual misconduct allegations in entertainment — and other industries — since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October, stars of the big and small screen are planning to wear all black to the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday in support of those who have spoken out about sexual harassment and to protest gender inequality.  Along with the dark ensembles, participants will reportedly be accessorizing with pins created by Time’s Up — the coalition behind the statement.  CREDIT: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and 300 other prominent women in the entertainment industry are behind the Time’s Up initiative aimed at eradicating abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation in the work place.  Related Natalie Portman Speaks Out on 'Pervasive' Abuse in Hollywood Kerry Washington, Time's Up Leaders Among Investors in The Wing, a Women's Workspace Startup  The alliance almost decided to boycott the Golden Globe Awards entirely, Kerry Washington told the LA Times. But the group eventually decided against it, suggesting that it was important to support their peers who were nominated.  Instead, an agreement was made to wear all black, with the hopes that this unified stand would prompt a larger discussion from the red carpet, leveraging the access to millions of viewers tuned in to watch the awards show, both on camera and online, with the hashtag #WhyWeWearBlack.  “Wearing black is an opportunity to talk about all the other things that we’re doing,” Washington explained to the Times. “We’re saying that we are three-dimensional, fully realized human beings as women. We are participants in this entertainment industry, and we have something to say.”  Despite the all-black attire creating a seemingly similar aesthetic, Cristina Ehrlich, whose clients include Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Greta Gerwig, Laura Dern, Alison Brie, Allison Williams, and Tina Fey, said her clients will still be telling a unique story through fashion.  “People aren’t using words anymore like, ‘I want to look sexy.’ It’s more about, ‘I want to look like I’m a woman of power. I want to look like a woman who is standing my ground,'” Ehrlich told Variety earlier this week.  Several women have even requested to wear female designers, she added.  “Because [the Globes] is international and it’s the Hollywood Foreign Press, you really want these women to have a moment that is going to strike as many different audiences as you can,” she said.  Stylist Ilaria Urbanati, who works with Dwayne Johnson, Tom Hiddleston, and Armie Hammer, posted about the protest on Instagram in December and confirmed her male clients will be wearing black in unity with women.  “Safe to say this may not be the right time to choose to be the odd man out here,” she wrote.  To the critics who argued that #WhyWeWearBlack wouldn’t be an effective demonstration, actress Rashida Jones says they’re missing the point entirely.  “This is not a silent protest,” the actress told InStyle. “We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.” Online, fellow actors Ashley Judd and Tessa Thompson tweeted their support of Jones’ statements.  Viewers will get to see that online solidarity in action on the red carpet Sunday night.	0

She went on to represent Nebraska at the national pageant and was crowned the 2009-2010 National American Miss Junior Teen.[10] In 2012, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012. She went on to represent Nebraska at Miss Teen USA 2012 at Atlantis Paradise Island in Nassau, Bahamas, but was unplaced.[11] At the end of her reign, she crowned Jasmine Fuelberth as her successor.[12] After a hiatus, Summers returned to pageantry and competed in Miss Nebraska USA 2016, where she placed as the second runner-up.  In 2018, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska USA 2018 by Fuelberth, who was the outgoing titleholder.

At the national competition, co-host Vanessa Lachey asked the following: ""You are on your way to a march where someone hands you a blank sign and a marker. What do you put on your sign and why?"":  ""...I say 'Speak your voice'. I don't know what march we're on our way to in this hypothetical situation, but no matter where you're going, whatever type of march it is, you're obviously on your way to that march because you care about that cause so go speak to people. When they have questions, communicate with them. Listen to their views also. That is one thing in the United States that we really need to focus on is listening to each other! ...""  involve in racist Instagram video 2018 [ edit ]  Miss USA (Sarah Summers) has been involved a racist Instagram video.The contestant is shown gossiping backstage about a couple of their non-English-speaking competitors, Miss Vietnam (H’Hen Nie) and Miss Cambodia (Rern Sinat). It starts out with Miss USA asking the other girls what they think about Miss Vietnam, with Hung and Morales describing her as “cute”. But then Miss USA starts shading Nie’s English speaking skills:“She pretends to know so much English and then you ask her a question after having a whole conversation with her and she goes [nods and smiles]” laughs Summers.While Miss Australia also let out a laugh half way through Summers’ comment, she stays quiet, perhaps unsure what to say in response.Miss USA then switches focus to Miss Cambodia, talking about how “confusing” it must be to not speak English.“Miss Cambodia is here and doesn’t speak any English, and not a single other person speaks her language. Can you imagine?” Summers continues.“Francesca said that it would be so isolating, and I said, ‘Yes’. I mean just confusing all the time.”Summers then turns to Miss Colombia to say, “you at least speak pretty good English,” before Miss Australia adds, “And you have your Spanish.”The girls then all agree it would be “really hard” with Summers concluding, “poor Cambodia”.[19].  Miss USA has apologised for making comments about her fellow Miss Universe contestants' English language skills, admitting what she said could have been ""perceived as not respectful"" after people described the quotes as racist. [20].    As Miss USA 2018, Summers represented the United States at Miss Universe 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand, where she placed in the top twenty. The eventual winner was Catriona Gray of the Philippines.[21][22]"	0

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding cake has finally been unveiled—and it's one gorgeous dessert! London-based baker Claire Ptak and her team created a lemon elderflower cake for Harry and Meghan's wedding's reception.  Kensington Palace first shared the wedding cake plans back in March, revealing that Ptak, who was raised in California and now owns Violet Cakes in London, was selected to bake it. Many were surprised that the couple chose a lemon elderflower cake for their Windsor Castle reception, since most royal wedding cakes are traditionally fruit cake. But Harry and Meghan broke from tradition to choose a spring-inspired cake covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.  See the cake from every angle here:  A full look at the cake on display. Getty Images  Getty Images  A close-up look at the fresh flowers on top. Getty Images  A day before the wedding, the Palace shared photos and a video of Ptak's team working on the cake in the Buckingham Palace kitchen. Even though they are baking and icing the cake at the Palace, Ptak revealed her team will assemble the cake at Windsor Castle on Saturday morning.  See the full video, including details on the cake recipe, below:  🎥 Watch as baker Claire Ptak begins work on the #RoyalWedding Cake! pic.twitter.com/OTdcF9hc0a — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) May 18, 2018  This isn't the first royal wedding cake preview fans have received so far. A few days ago, Ptak posted a photo of lemon crates on her Instagram along with the caption ""And so it begins 🍋""  According to the Kensington Palace Twitter account, Ptak ""focuses on using seasonal and organic ingredients in her cakes."" It was also revealed that Markle had previously interviewed Chef Ptak on The Tig.  ""Pastry Chef Claire Ptak has hit the nail on the head with her London bakery serving up delightful treats that have garnered a cult following (in that ever so civilized British way) in the UK and beyond,"" Markle wrote on her now-shuttered lifestyle site back in 2015.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have asked Claire to create a lemon elderflower cake that will incorporate the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 20, 2018  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are looking forward to sharing the cake with guests at their wedding at Windsor Castle on May 19th. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 20, 2018  Earlier this year, Ptak shared the happy news on her Instagram as well.  ""Kinda excited to announce this one!!"" she teased in the caption. ""Violet has been chosen to make the wedding cake for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. @kensingtonroyal They both share so many of the same values regarding food provenance, sustainability, seasonality and of course, flavour! Xxx""    Unlike American wedding cakes, the top tier of British wedding cakes is traditionally what we think of as a Christmas-style fruit cake, so it will last long enough to be served at the couple's first child's christening, making the lemon elderflower cake something of a departure from the norm. At their reception in 2011, Will and Kate served a groom's cake made of chocolate biscuits in addition to a traditional eight-tiered wedding cake."	0
"“I just got wasted the whole time,” he revealed during an interview with The Times. “You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. Became a total liability.”  But now, according to a source, Robert is back on the straight and narrow, thanks to his fiancé FKA Twigs.  The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.  ""He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,” adds the source. “Rob’s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn’t given up his pot habit. He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!"	1

"It’s been nearly one week since the release of Demi Lovato 's newest album, Tell Me You Love Me and fans are still trying to decipher the meaning behind some of the album’s songs.  While Demi recently revealed the personal experiences that inspired the track “Daddy Issues,” she remains tight-lipped on the meaning of “Ruin the Friendship.” During an appearance on The Ellen DeGenres Show , Ellen tried her best to get Demi to confirm fan speculation that the track is about Nick Jonas .  “Supposedly there’s a song about Nick Jonas in here and because you claim to be so honest, I feel like you should be honest with that answer,” Ellen said. Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, “you know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.”  Questions from fans about the song’s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track’s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Nick.  Demi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation.  ""And I was like, 'You know what, I'm just going to write about it.' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,"" she continued. ""Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it's ballsy. It's like, 'Hey! Here's my feelings for you!' … They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.”  Fans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi’s upcoming YouTube documentary * Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated* set to debut on October 17, maybe we’ll get another clue. In the meantime, check out her interview with Ellen:  Related:Demi Lovato Reveals the Devastating Reason She Got Sober  Check this out:"	0
"The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People's new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him—at church, the ice rink, and beyond. “He loves her. He wants her back,” the source said, adding that Bieber “misses” Gomez.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Bieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.  But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. “[He] doesn’t care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""  Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.  But Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.  Gomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:  Instagram  Bieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies."	1

Khloe Kardasian/Instagram  In a photo the star shared of the couple kissing in their costumes, Kardashian called her boyfriend of over a year the “moon of my life,” after she captioned a shirtless photo of the NBA star with “That’s daddy,” Monday night on social media.

RELATED PHOTOS: See All of Kim Kardashian’s Sexy, Music Legend-Inspired Halloween Costumes from the Weekend  Up until now, Kardashian’s kept her stomach covered (like her sister Kylie Jenner, who’s also pregnant) by having her sisters stand in front of her in photos, wearing lots of black and oversize sweatshirts. But perhaps the 33-year-old star is ready to start showing more skin and taking some maternity dressing advice from her older sister Kourtney, who recently told us, “Don’t feel like you have to hide your bump and just dress for your body. Just embrace it!”  Khloe Kardasian/Instagram  Last month, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Kardashian is expecting her first child, a baby boy, with Thompson.  “Yes, Khloé and Tristan are expecting and they are absolutely thrilled,” one source told PEOPLE of the couple.  “This is something Khloé has wanted for years and years and yet it’s more than that: She didn’t want it unless she was in the right relationship for it,” the source added. “This is such a wonderful moment for her: not only is she going to be a mother, she is going to be raising a child with a man she truly loves. Everyone is over the moon for them both.”  What do you think of Khloé and Tristan’s costume? Sound off in the comments below.	0

"P!nk Hands 12 -Year-Old Superfan the Mic at Her Concert & Is Blown Away: Watch  Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist's song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink's concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the ""Beautiful Trauma"" singer: ""when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,"" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show. While Anthony didn't get to go on stage, Pink did hand her the mic -- and was instantly floored.  Anthony belted out a flawless solo version of Pink's hit ""Perfect,"" drawing a roaring applause from the crowd and a stunned response from the singer. Judging by her reaction, it's safe to assume Pink thought Anthony was pretty ""perfect"" herself.  ""Thank you for that,"" the still-amazed Pink said after returning onstage. ""How do you follow that?""  Watch Anthony give Pink a run for her money below, and see the video she tweeted that made it all happen."	0

Following the deadliest mass shooting in American history, in which at least 58 people were killed and 500 wounded at a musical festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night, artists, actors and other celebrities from around the country are now using their platform in the hopes of advancing the conversation about gun control.  Since identified as Stephen Paddock, the shooter opened fire on a crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, stationed across the street from the outdoor venue where country singer Jason Aldean was performing at the time. The police uncovered at least 10 rifles in Paddock’s room, including hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Eric Paddock, the brother of the suspect, told reporters on Monday that Stephen Paddock legally owned “a couple” of handguns and may have owned one long gun, “but he had them in a safe.” It’s still unclear how Paddock came into possession of so many rifles.  In a ten-tweet-long thread, John Mayer laid out a passionate argument for immediate change with regards to gun control. “I’m going to state my thoughts without the words ‘gun control’ ‘assault rifles’ and others that stoke reflexive debate,” he began. “I’m a logic and reason guy. I like to remove emotion (impossible today) and look at an issue in a theoretical vacuum to make sense of it. Lawmakers and influencers: if you’re not doing everything in your power to at least *reassess* the threat of mass murder, why can’t you come out and tell us that this is the life we’re going to have to accept? That these are the new terms? That it’s a fact of modern day life that from time to time we’ll lose dozens of people in seconds? That daily life is a lottery system? And if you can’t say that, if it’s just too cold and brutal a thought to bear, then isn’t that proof you haven’t solved the problem yet?  He continue: “If you’re not at least trying to fix this, you’re effectively telling the country in your (in)actions that this somehow acceptable. There’s two moralities: morality identity and morality-in-action. Our greater moral identity doesn’t match our actions so far.9) If you’re not open minded to solving this, you’re morally surrendering us all to a very certain fate. There is no in between here. **Please use the energy normally allotted to fighting this argument to rethinking this problem.** Unless you don’t think there is one…”  Billy Eichner was likewise outspoken. After tweeting “enough already” in all caps, the Difficult People and American Horror Story: Cult star questioned why congress hasn’t been pushed more on the matter since Sandy Hook.  GUN CONTROL NOW. ENOUGH ALREADY. GROW THE FUCK UP. THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN’T NEED A FUCKING MACHINE GUN. ENOUGH ALREADY. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  AND DON’T TALK ABOUT THE 2ND AMENDMFNT.

We’re calling Congress about everything else, why not this?? — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  Lady Gaga shared a similar message, asking Democrats and Republicans to unite to bring an end to “terrorism.” She then directed a tweet towards Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, urging them to “act quickly” on gun control.  This is terrorism plain and simple. Terror bares no race, gender or religion. Democrats & Republicans please unite now #guncontrol ?? — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017  Prayers are important but @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump blood is on the hands of those who have power to legislate. #GunControl act quickly. https://t.co/bXZQ7enuEp — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017  Emmy Rossum, best known for playing the character Fiona Gallagher on Shameless, also tweeted at Trump calling for action.

They need action. — Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) October 2, 2017  I believe in prayer, but it’s not enough by itself. We need better LAWS. In no world does a CIVILIAN need a MACHINE GUN. Let’s fix this. — Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) October 2, 2017  John Legend said the news was “heartbreaking” and “devastating” in his own tweet before retweeting Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden on the need for gun control.  The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017  Our grief isn’t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017  How long do we let gun violence tear families apart? Enough. Congress & the WH should act now to save lives. There’s no excuse for inaction. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2017  Gaga’s fellow pop star Ariana Grande, whose concert in Manchester, England earlier this year was the target of a bombing that killed 22 people, called for “love, unity, peace, gun control.”  My heart is breaking for Las Vegas. We need love, unity, peace, gun control & for people to look at this & call this what it is = terrorism. — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) October 2, 2017  Mark Ruffalo (as well as Julianne Moore, in a similar message) encouraged everyone to join the movement to end gun violence by texting Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization that works with lawmakers to pass “common-sense laws and policies that save lives.”  Today we mourn for Las Vegas, tomorrow we fight for them.  Join the movement to end gun violence: Text ACT to 64433. pic.twitter.com/yNmPeBjrFB — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 2, 2017  Two-time Olympian Aly Raisman said she was “disgusted” by the news and questioned why it is “so easy for crazy people to have guns.”  WHY is this horrible person allowed to have a gun?

According to the South African newspaper The Times — which ran a story about her 67-page contract with the concert promoter Kusasa, the organizer of the South African leg of her current tour — she has some interesting personnel requirements, as well.    Onstage with her at all times must be those 11 security guards — eight of whom are to be on chairs that can swivel 30 degrees. (I know there's a lot of kidnapping in South Africa, but that's going a little overboard.)	1
Mariah Carey was spotted out with ex-boyfriend, dancer and choreographer Bryan Tanaka, in Beverly Hills on Friday night.  The pair — who parted ways in April — were snapped cozying up at table and sharing a sweet kiss. Tanaka also was photographed offering Carey a forkful of food.  Carey, 47, had posted a nostalgic photo of a date she shared with Tanaka, 33, on Friday, captioning,“#fbf.”  After calling it quits with fiancé James Packer in October, Carey embarked on a whirlwind romance with her backup dancer Tanaka, with the pair spending holidays together and traveling the world. News of their split came last month with a source close to Carey telling PEOPLE it was the singer who ended things.  “Everyone hoped that she would,” the Carey source said. “She has better things to focus on. Mariah is happy. She is focusing on her kids and new music.”  The insider added, “Bryan was a good distraction after she split from James. This is a good time for her to be single and focus on herself.”  FROM PEN: Nick Cannon on His Broadway Inspiration for Wild’n Out  TMZ first reported the news that Carey had broken up with Tanaka due to his spending habits and his jealousy over her relationship with ex-husband Nick Cannon, with whom she shares 6-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan.  The former couple, who split in 2014 and divorced in November, continue to remain close as co-parents of their children, and their bond reportedly irked Tanaka, leading him to flirt with other women in front of Carey as revenge.  Earlier this month, PEOPLE reported that there was “hope” that Cannon and Carey would get back together and the two had been “getting along great.”	1
There's been a surprising lack of footage from the upcoming adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower.  Outside of an early leak of the trailer back in October, alongside footage shown to attendees at CinemaCon, we've only now gotten its first trailer ahead of its August release.  However, with such a Disney-dominated start to the year - between trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, The Last Jedi, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Thor: Ragnarok - perhaps Sony has bided its time so the relatively risky film doesn't get drowned out by the competition.

The last living member of the knightly order of gunslingers, Roland's fabled quest is to find The Dark Tower that is rumoured to be the nexus of all universes before it's destroyed by The Man in Black, Walter; a warlock who has already reigned destruction on the people of Mid-World.

"Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969) is an American singer, actress, dancer and producer. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, Lopez received a Golden Globe nomination and became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.[3]  Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me... Then, and appeared in Maid in Manhattan.  After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol, and released her seventh studio album Love?. In 2016, she began starring in the crime drama series Shades of Blue and commenced a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on World of Dance.  With a cumulative film gross of US$2.9 billion and estimated global sales of 80 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin performer in the United States. In 2012, Forbes ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.[4] Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include: ""If You Had My Love"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""All I Have"", and ""On the Floor"", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time.[5] For her contributions to the music industry, Lopez has received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Billboard Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award among other honors. Her other ventures include clothing lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation. She has been divorced three times and gave birth to twins in 2008 with then-husband Marc Anthony.  Early life  Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in The Bronx borough of New York City, to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodríguez and David López.[6] She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda, a journalist.[7] David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.[8] At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay ""out of trouble"".[9] Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School.[10] In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school's softball team.[11] She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.[9]  While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.[12] Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a ""famous movie star"". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a ""really stupid"" idea and that ""no Latinos did that"". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a Golden Musicals of Broadway, which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.[8]  Career  1991–1996: Career beginnings  Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of ""Games"" at the 18th Annual American Music Awards.[13] Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program In Living Color. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson.[14] Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her ""own thing"".[15]  Lopez received her first professional acting gig in the direct-to-video drama film Lost in the Wild (1993), co-starring with Lindsay Wagner and Robert Loggia.[16] Later in 1993, Lopez signed a deal with CBS to co-star in the television series Second Chances. Lopez received her first major big-screen role in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama My Family portraying Young Maria.[17] Although her role was uncredited, Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her performance.[17] In November 1995, Lopez starred in Money Train alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson as New York City transit cops. In August 1996, Lopez had a supporting role in the comedy Jack.[18]  1997–1999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6  In February 1997, Lopez starred alongside Jack Nicholson and Stephen Dorff in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine.[19] Lopez starred as the title role of the Selena biopic of the same name in March.[20] Despite having previously worked with the film's director on My Family, Lopez was subjected to an intense auditioning process before she was cast in the film.[21] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that even in the ""forgettable films"" Money Train, and Jack, Lopez's ""presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom"" and with Selena she's ""seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers"". He concluded by calling the film not just a celebration of Selena's life, but also of the actress who portrayed her.[22] The announcement was described as the ""role of a lifetime."" from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million,[23][24] which made Lopez the highest-paid Hispanic actress in history. After filming Selena, Lopez was ""really feeling [her] Latin roots"" and cut a demo in Spanish.[25] Lopez's manager then sent the song, titled ""Vivir Sin Ti"" (Living without You), to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.[26]  In April, Lopez starred in the horror film Anaconda alongside Ice Cube and Jon Voight.[27] Lopez starred alongside Sean Penn and Billy Bob Thornton in the crime film U Turn in October. The film, which is based on the novel Stray Dogs by John Ridley, received somewhat positive reviews from critics.[28] In June, Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name (1996).[29] Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, Lopez won rave reviews for her performance.[30] Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the computer-animated film Antz in October.[31]  Lopez's debut single, ""If You Had My Love"", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album.[32][33] Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single ""...Baby One More Time"" four months prior.[34] During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent.[35] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: ""If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.""[36] ""Waiting for Tonight"", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song.[37] Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the ""popular actor even more popular"". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by ""this woman who seemed to have so many different talents"".[36] By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.[38] She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).[34]  2000–2002: Film success, J.Lo and This Is Me... Then  On February 23, 2000, Lopez, accompanied by then boyfriend Sean Combs, wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress on the red carpet of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. The dress ""had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,"" exposing her midriff and then as cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe.[39] The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event.[40] Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that she had no idea ""it was going to become such a big deal"".[41] Lopez returned to the big-screen in August, starring in the psychological thriller The Cell opposite Vincent D'Onofrio.[42]  During the process of recording her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image as she began to develop into a sex symbol. She started going by J.Lo, something fans often called her.[43] She subsequently named the album J.Lo. Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200.[44] During the same week, her romantic comedy film The Wedding Planner in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States.[45] The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single ""Play"".[46] In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that ""the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored"" in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes.[43] The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film Angel Eyes, which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews.[47] After several months, J.Lo was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song ""I'm Real"". This led to the release of ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", which quickly reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Its success resulted in J.Lo being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks.[46] J.Lo became the best-selling album of Lopez's career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.[48][49]  Having redefined Lopez's sound with ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", Epic decided to release further remixes in order to ""keep the momentum going"".[50] A remix album entitled J to tha L–O! The Remixes was subsequently released on February 5, 2002. It debuted at the summit of the Billboard 200, making it the first remix album to do so. Its lead single, ""Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)"", featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah, reached number one in the US.[51] J to tha L–O! The Remixes became one of the best-selling remix albums of all time, selling 1.5 million copies in the US.[52] It produced two more singles: ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" and ""Alive"", a ballad co-written by her husband at the time, Cris Judd. In April 2002, Lopez opened her restaurant, Madrè's.[43] The following month, she starred in the thriller film Enough, which was described by the Boston Herald as a ""kick-but, female empowerment"" film.[53] While filming Enough, which required an overworked Lopez to practice Krav Maga, she suffered a nervous breakdown. She recalled feeling ""sick and weird"", refusing therapeutic help or medication. She confessed, ""I was like – I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything.""[54] In September, she released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It performed strongly despite predictions that it would fail, and became the top-selling fragrance in the US.[55]  Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then, was released on November 25, 2002. It was dedicated to actor Ben Affleck, her fiancé at the time. The album's lead single ""Jenny from the Block"", was later described by Sam Lansky of MTV News as her most iconic single.[56] In the song, Lopez ""intones her modest childhood roots"".[57] The album itself performed strongly, selling 2.6 million copies in the US.[52] Its second single, ""All I Have"", peaked at number one in the US. That December, Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, which became the highest-grossing film of her career.[58]  2003–2005: Gigli and Rebirth  In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film.[58][59] Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying ""[It] was very tough"", ""the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.""[60] In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a ""more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede.""[61] Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.[45]  In March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film Jersey Girl, alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that ""they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come"".[62] In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama Shall We Dance?, a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following Gigli.[58]  After placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth ""came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn.""[63] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after ""fawning"" over Affleck on This Is Me... Then"", Lopez ""wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight"" on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks.[64] The album produced the single ""Get Right"", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom.[65] In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15 million.[66] The film's marketing played up Lopez's ""Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image"", and it became a box office success.[58][67] In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.  2006–2009: Career disappointments and Como Ama una Mujer  Lopez in 2008  In April 2006, Lopez reappeared on the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on ""Control Myself"", the lead single from LL Cool J's twelfth studio album Todd Smith. The song peaked at number four on the chart following its release as a music download, making it the pair's second collaboration to reach the top five.[68] Bordertown, a film based on the Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, made its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006. Lopez, who also acts as the film's producer, stars as Lauren Adrian, an American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war.[69] Bordertown received a direct-to-video release.[58] DanceLife, a reality series following the lives of seven dancers trying to break into the world of professional dance, aired on MTV from January 15 to March 5, 2007. Lopez produced, created and was featured in the show.[70] According to the album's co-producer Estéfano, Lopez's fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer would ""prove critics wrong"" with its ""big songs that require a voice""; referring to the criticism of Lopez having a ""limited"" vocal tone. The album's lead single ""Qué Hiciste"" reached number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. Lopez performed the song on the sixth season of American Idol on April 11, 2007, becoming the first person to perform a Spanish song on the series.[65] The album received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a debut Spanish album and the highest digital sales.[73][74]  In September 2007, Lopez starred in the biographical film El Cantante, which is based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe's wife Puchi.[75] Lopez revealed that she felt her performance in the film El Cantante should have earned her an Oscar.[76] ""I feel like I had that [Oscar worthy role] in 'El Cantante,' but I don't think the academy members saw it"".[76] El Cantante did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million.[58] Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28.[77] Lopez's sixth studio album Brave, released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.[78] The album produced two singles, ""Do It Well"" and ""Hold It Don't Drop It"". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, Jennifer Lopez Presents: Como Ama una Mujer, based on the lyrics of Como Ama una Mujer aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. She placed her career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008.[79] In late 2009, Lopez released two songs for her seventh studio album, Love? (""Louboutins"" and ""Fresh Out of the Oven""); however, the songs failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts which led to her departure from Epic Records.[80]  2010–2012: Career rejuvenation with American Idol and touring  Lopez parted ways with Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release her seventh studio album Love? under a new label.[81] Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, which commenced in 2009. Upon signing a new contract with Island Records, recording resumed on the album.[82] The New York Daily News revealed that Lopez would be taking some of the records recorded under Sony Music Entertainment to her new label so that they could be included on the album.[83] In April, Lopez starred in the romantic comedy The Back-up Plan, her first theatrical role in three years.[79] In June, following the departure of Ellen DeGeneres from American Idol, it was reported that Lopez was in talks to join season ten's judging panel.[84][85][86] During this same time, Lopez and Anthony were being considered for a role on The X Factor for their appeal to Latin and International markets.[87] It was officially announced in September that Lopez would be joining the tenth season of American Idol. MTV stated that the deal was ""mutually beneficial to all those involved"", while CNN reported that Lopez was viewing it as a decision to revive her career, while American Idol producers believed that Lopez and Steven Tyler's appointments would strengthen viewing figures.[88] In October, Lopez released her fourteenth fragrance, Love and Glamour. The perfume was inspired by Lopez's forthcoming ""return to the spotlight"".[89]  L'Oreal Paris named Lopez their new Global Ambassador and the face of their brands, including EverPure hair care, Preference hair color and Youth Code skin care. Her EverSleek hair care ads made their debut in early 2011, to coincide with the release of Love? and her debut as a judge on American Idol.[90] To further promote her comeback, in February, Venus chose Lopez as their new Global Ambassador.[91] Lopez's comeback single ""On the Floor"" was released later that same month. The song topped the charts across the globe, becoming one of the most successful singles of the year.[92] The song also became her highest charting single commercially as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since ""Jenny from the Block"".[93] Love?, which was released in May, was a moderate commercial success, and was viewed as a humble comeback from Lopez, as many had considered her recording career over.[78] Lopez launched her next fragrance Love and Light in July, exclusively on HSN. 51,000 bottles of the fragrance were sold at its premiere, becoming Lopez's most successful fragrance launch to date, making over $2.9 million.[94] In September, Lopez launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and accessories line for Kohl's with Tommy Hilfiger.[95] In addition to the clothing line, she also launched the Jennifer Lopez Home Collection, featuring bedding, towels and luggage.[96] Later that same month Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, enlisted Lopez to promote their products, including the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio. Olivier Francois, the Chrysler chief marketing officer, stated that she ""fits perfectly with the brand"".[97]  In January 2012, Lopez returned as a judge on the eleventh season of American Idol, earning a reported $20 million.[98] Later that same month, a new talent show, ¡Q'Viva! The Chosen, created by Simon Fuller premiered on Univision and was a hit for the channel.[99][100] It followed Lopez, Anthony and director-choeographer Jamie King as they travelled across 21 countries in Latin America to find new talent for a Las Vegas show. On May 18, Lopez returned to the big screen starring alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Matthew Morrison and Dennis Quaid in the film What to Expect When You're Expecting, which is based on the novel of the same name.[101] In late May, Lopez released her fragrance Glowing by JLo, which she described as an ""evolution"" of Glow by JLo.[102]  Lopez launched the Dance Again World Tour, her first headlining concert tour, on June 14.[103] It was a lucrative, grossing over $1 million per show.[104] On July 12, she launched Teeology, a luxury T-shirt e-commerce.[105] Lopez voiced Shira, a saber tooth tiger, in the animated film, Ice Age: Continental Drift, the fourth film in the Ice Age franchise.[106] The film became her highest opening weekend figure.[107]  Lopez's first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits, was released on July 24, 2012 in the United States.[108] It was released by Epic Records, as Lopez owed them one final album to end her contract, despite previously announcing that she had fulfilled her contract with the label.[109] Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Anthony and the ""breakup of a family"", felt as if the album's sole single, ""Dance Again"", had come to her at the ""perfect moment"".[110][111] ""Dance Again"" and ""Goin' In"", a single from the soundtrack of the dance film Step Up Revolution, both reached the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs, giving Lopez her twelfth and thirteenth number one on that chart, respectively.[112] nuvoTV announced in September its premier partnership with Lopez, that will see her work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing in network programming.[113][114]  2013–2015: Television ventures and A.K.A.  In January 2013, Lopez starred alongside Jason Statham in the crime thriller Parker, in which she played Leslie. Her performance earned positive reviews, with Chicago Tribune commending the role for giving Lopez ""an opportunity to be dramatic, romantic, funny, depressed, euphoric and violent. The audience stays with her all the way"".[115] The following month, she gained widespread notoriety for wearing a daring black dress at the Grammy Awards, which revealed her entire right leg; despite a conservative dress code which had been issued to celebrities in attendance.[116] In May, Lopez was announced as the chief creative officer of nuvoTV. In addition, she founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Móvil, which is catered specifically for Latinos.[117] She lobbied for more Hispanic diversity on television,[118] hoping to empower the Latin community in these media ventures, stating: ""There's a big revolution going on, it's like a media and cultural revolution of Latinos here in the United States. We're realizing our power. We're realizing that we matter here.""[119] Inspired by her gay aunt who had recently died, Lopez signed on as executive producer of the television series The Fosters, which is about a same-sex couple raising a family.[120] The show premiered on ABC Family on June 3, 2013, and has since been a ratings success for the network.[121] Later that June, Lopez performed at the birthday of Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.[122] Doing so, she garnered widespread backlash for performing for the leader of a ""repressive, authoritarian regime"".[123] Her publicist released an apology.[122] Lopez returned as judge on American Idol for its thirteenth season for a reported salary of $17.5 million.[124] She was ranked as the fifth highest-paid woman in music for 2013, having earned $45 million.[104]  After the conclusion of her Dance Again World Tour, Lopez began recording her eighth studio album, A.K.A., inspired by her travels.[125] It was released in June 2014 through Capitol Records, experiencing lackluster sales.[126] The album produced three singles: ""I Luh Ya Papi"", which features French Montana, ""First Love"", and ""Booty"", featuring Pitbull or rapper Iggy Azalea. ""Booty"" debuted inside the top twenty in the United States, making it her second-highest debut on the Billboard Hot 100 after ""On the Floor"".[127] In April, the official song for the 2014 FIFA World Cup performed by Pitbull, Lopez and Brazilian recording artist Claudia Leitte, ""We Are One (Ole Ola)"", was released.

Titled All I Have, it takes place at Planet Hollywood's The AXIS theater.[148][149] The residency has been lucrative,[150] and Lopez signed a three-year contract which will see her perform 120 shows.[151] In March 2016, six years after announcing her departure, she announced her return to Epic Records, signing a multi-album deal with the label.[48] Her first single since returning to Epic, ""Ain't Your Mama"", was released the following month.[152] With earnings of $39.5 million, she was among the highest-paid female artists from June 2015 to June 2016.[150] Lopez reprised her voice role as Shira in the animated film Ice Age: Collision Course, which was released in July 2016.[153]  In collaboration with Giuseppe Zanotti, Lopez designed a capsule collection of shoes and jewelry. Giuseppe for Jennifer Lopez launched in January 2017.[154] In July 2016, Lopez announced a new dance competition series entitled World of Dance, for which she serves as an executive producer and judge. Created in partnership with World of Dance, the series was greenlit by NBC with a straight-to-series order for ten episodes.[155] World of Dance premiered on May 30, 2017; with 9.7 million viewers, it became the most-watched premiere for a summer alternative series in nine years.[156][157] According to Forbes, Lopez was the eleventh highest-paid female celebrity between June 2016 and June 2017, with earnings of $38 million.[158] Lopez is working on her second full length Spanish album, which is set to be released through Sony Music Latin; Marc Anthony serves as an executive producer for the project.[74][159] It is titled Por Primera Vez, which translates to For the First Time in English.[160] The album's lead single, ""Ni Tú Ni Yo"" (featuring Cuban reggaeton group Gente de Zona), was released on in July 2017.[161][162] The second single ""Amor, Amor, Amor"" featuring Wisin followed in November 2017.[160]  In April 2018, Lopez launched her limited-edition makeup collection in collaboration with Inglot Cosmetics.[163] That month, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in the world,[164] and released a new Spanish single, ""El Anillo"".[165] The following month she released a bilingual single titled ""Dinero"", featuring DJ Khaled and Cardi B.[166]  Upcoming projects  Lopez is set to star as drug lord Griselda Blanco in a television film for HBO, which will focus on the ""rise and fall"" of Blanco. She will once more serve as an executive producer for the film, which is currently in development.[167] She will also produce and star in a romantic comedy film Second Act (2018), which will be directed by Peter Segal.[168] As an executive producer, Lopez is also developing an untitled legal drama for CBS and futuristic drama series entitled C.R.I.S.P.R. for NBC.[169] Sometime in 2019, Lopez is set to executive produce and star in NBC's Bye Bye Birdie Live!, a live television production of the stage musical of the same name.[170] She is also set to star in and executive produce Hustlers for Annapurna Pictures, which is inspired by a New York article by Jessica Pressler entitled, ""The Hustlers at Scores.""[171]  Personal life  Lopez's personal life has attracted widespread media attention.[172] From February 22, 1997, to January 1998, she was married to Cuban waiter Ojani Noa.[173] Since their brief marriage, Lopez has endured many legal troubles regarding her relationship with Noa. In April 2006, she sued to prevent him from publishing a book about their marriage, contending that it violated their confidentiality agreement.[174] The following year, a court-appointed arbitrator issued a permanent injunction forbidding Noa from ""criticizing, denigrating, casting in a negative light or otherwise disparaging"" Lopez. She was awarded $545,000 in compensatory damages and Noa was ordered to hand over all copies of materials related to the book to Lopez or her attorney.[175] A lawsuit regarding a compromising private honeymoon video in Noa's possession is presently running.[176]  While working on her first album, On the 6, Lopez began dating record producer and rapper Sean Combs. On December 27, 1999, the couple was arrested along with two others in connection with a shooting outside the Times Square Club in New York. They were charged with criminal possession of a weapon as well as stolen property. Lopez was soon exonerated, having had nothing to do with the crime.[177] However, Combs was charged and indicted by a Manhattan grand jury.[178] After leaving Combs, Lopez developed a relationship with former back-up dancer Cris Judd, to whom she was married from September 29, 2001, to June 2002.[179] Following her second divorce due to irreconcilable differences, she commenced a high-profile relationship with actor and director Ben Affleck, to whom she became engaged in November 2002.[180][181] The media began to refer to them as ""Bennifer"", and they became a prominent supercouple in the media and popular culture. Bennifer became a popular term, which was eventually entered into urban dictionaries and neologism dictionaries as notable,[182] as the name blend started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of their first names.[183] The couple postponed their nuptials indefinitely a day prior to the planned ceremony in September 2003, citing the media's interference with the event as the reason.[184]  Anthony and Lopez, 2006  Following her break-up with Affleck in January 2004, Lopez began dating her longtime friend, Marc Anthony (real name: Marco Antonio Muñiz). The couple wed that June,[185][186] and lived in Brookville, New York.[187] Two men attempted to ransom a private wedding video that was stolen from the couple for one million dollars; however, they were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy, attempted grand larceny and possession of stolen property.[188] On November 7, 2007, during the final night of their co-headlining tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child.[189] The announcement ended months of speculation over the pregnancy.[190] Her father confirmed that the couple were expecting twins, revealing that it runs in the family: ""My sister also had twins, so it's a hereditary thing.""[191] Lopez, who is a Roman Catholic, has stated that her faith discouraged her from pursuing in vitro fertilization treatment while trying to get pregnant.[192]  Lopez gave birth to a son, Maximilian David, and a daughter, Emme Maribel, in Long Island, New York, on February 22, 2008.[193][194] The twins were introduced in the March 11, 2008, issue of People, for which the magazine paid a reported $6 million; the photographs of the twins became the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken at the time.[195] Three years later in July 2011, the couple announced their split, with Anthony filing for divorce in April 2012.[196] Their divorce was finalized on June 16, 2014, with Lopez retaining primary physical custody of the two children.[197] On December 31, 2014, she legally changed her name back to Jennifer Lopez, dropping Anthony's last name (Muñiz).[198][199]  Lopez had an on-off relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016.[200][201] In February 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez.[202][203]  In March 2018, Lopez opened up about her own Me Too movement story of being sexually harassed by a director early on in her career, when she was asked to take her top off during one of her first films.[204][205] Lopez has also been an active advocate for the Time's Up movement.[206]  Philanthropy and political activism  Following the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining various other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as ""What's Going On"" and ""El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)"", which benefited people affected by the tragedy.[207][208] One dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony's co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to Run for Something Better—a charitable organization supporting physical fitness programs for children.[77][209] In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, for her work in the film Bordertown, which shed light on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as ""one of the world's most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity.""[210][211]  In 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a telemedicine program supported by a partnership with the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.[212][213]  In December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive that would affect her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles as well as the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of her home town, New York City.[214] In May 2015, she became the first national celebrity spokesperson for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled ""Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are"".[215] That September, Lopez was announced as the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation.[216] This role sees her mobilizing action to address challenges faced by girls and women around the world, including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women.[217] In September 2017, following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, Lopez announced that she would be donating $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas residency to humanitarian aid for Puerto Rico.[218][219] Along with ex-husband Marc Anthony, she launched a humanitarian relief campaign entitled Somos Una Voz (English: We Are One Voice), an effort supported by various celebrities to rush supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Maria.[220] Lopez and Anthony presented a subsequent concert and telethon for disaster relief, ""One Voice: Somos Live!"", which raised over $35 million.[221] She was also among various artists featured on Lin-Manuel Miranda's charity single ""Almost Like Praying"" which benefits Puerto Rico.[222]  Lopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research.[223] In June 2013, amfAR presented Lopez with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work.[223] That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community.[224] The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award.[225] In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled ""Love Make the World Go Round"", a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[226] She was also featured on the song ""Hands"" along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting.[227] Among numerous other artists, Lopez signed an open letter from Billboard magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.[228]  Lopez endorsed President Barack Obama in his 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending a fundraising event for Obama in Paris.[229][230] She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October.[230][231]  Artistry  Musical style  According to author Ed Morales in The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond (2003), Lopez's music explores the ""romantic innocence"" of Latin music, while strongly identifying with hip hop.[234] Growing up, she was influenced by Latin styles ranging from salsa to bachata, but it was the 1979 hip hop song ""Rapper's Delight"" by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life.[235] Her debut album On the 6 fuses the influence of Latin music with R&B and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as ""state-of-the-art dance pop"".[236] Dee Lockett, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that songs such as ""Waiting for Tonight"" made Lopez ""arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time"".[237] While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song ""Let's Get Loud"".[238][239][240] She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song ""Cariño"", for her second album J.Lo.[241] A departure from her previous albums, This Is Me... Then blends 1970s soul with ""streetwise"" hip hop.[242] ""Get Right"", from Rebirth, is built around a sample of ""Soul Power 74"" by Maceo and the Macks, and is characterized by a repetitive saxophone riff. The New York Times called it ""one of the year's most unusual R&B songs"" which sounded ""like nothing else on the radio"".[243]  Described as autobiographical,[244] much of Lopez's music has centered around the ""ups and downs"" of love.[245] The lyrical content of This Is Me... Then is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song ""Dear Ben"" being described as the album's ""glowing centerpiece"".[246] Her first full length Spanish-language album, Como Ama una Mujer features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing.[247] When explaining her seventh studio album Love?, Lopez stated: ""There's still so much to learn and that's why the question mark.""[245] Other recurrent themes in Lopez's music have included her upbringing in the Bronx[236][248] and women's empowerment.[249]  Lopez has been influenced by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand.[250][251] She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration.[236] Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited,[252][253] and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining ""radio-friendly"".[254] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: ""Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.""[255] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice ""slight"" and wrote: ""Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style"".[256] Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark ""husky-voiced voluptuousness"" she has in her films.[257] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a ""breathy"" stylistic range, but lacking personality.[258]  Dance and stage  Considered one of dance's ""greatest success stories"",[155] Lopez felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, when she specialized in ballet, jazz and flamenco.[259][260] Her career commenced on the variety television sketch comedy series In Living Color, where she was a part of an ethnically diverse dance group known as the Fly Girls.[261] Janet Jackson, whom she briefly served as a backup dancer for, has been credited by Lopez as an inspiration for her own dance and videos.[262] In 2015, Refinery29 ranked Lopez at number two on ""11 Of Pop's Most Iconic Dancers"", behind Jackson.[263] Since beginning her own recording career, Lopez has become known for her body-emphasizing music videos, which often include dance routines.[264] Some of them have been the subject of controversy, including ""Jenny from the Block"", ""Dance Again"" and ""Booty"".[265][266] Her provocatively choreographed music video for ""If You Had My Love"" allowed Lopez to become a dominant figure on MTV networks worldwide.[267] Madeline Roth of MTV wrote: ""Her diverse videography encompasses some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century"",[268] with Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos observing that her ""dancing skills and ability to toy with her own celebrity have made her videos an important part of the new millennium’s pop canon.""[269]  On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal,[270] and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance.[271][272][273] Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who ""used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies"".[274] Troy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, ""She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.""[275] Her signature movements include ""clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations"".[276] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[277][278][279] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is ""undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show"".[270]  Lopez's provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series Britain's Got Talent was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom.[280][281] Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it ""indecent"" and ""disgraceful"", while an education group claimed that she ""disturbed public order and tarnished women's honor and respect"".[282]  Public image  Lopez performing during her Dance Again World Tour, December 2012.  Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: ""Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles ""I'm Real"" and ""Jenny From the Block"". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's not asking you to come hither.""[233] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: ""Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere."" Holloway noted her image to be ""a dash of ghetto fabulousness"" and ""middle-class respectability"" for mass appeal.[283] Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: ""Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth madre.""[284] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture.[285] Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a ""showbiz phenomenon"".[286]  Lopez is widely celebrated for her callipygian figure,[287] which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 hit ""Baby Got Back"".[288] She has been credited with influencing a change in mainstream female body image.[289] In Latin Sensations (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: ""Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold and allowed millions of women to feel good about their bodies. Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.""[36] Vanity Fair described her buttocks as ""in and of themselves, a cultural icon"".[290] Details magazine named Lopez the ""Sexiest Woman of the Year"" in 1998,[291] and she led FHM's ""100 Sexiest Women"" list twice.[292] In 2011, she was named ""The Most Beautiful Woman"" by People.[293] The following year, VH1 ranked her the fourth on their list of ""100 Sexiest Artists"",[294] while Vibe magazine named her the most ""lustable"" celebrity of the past twenty years.[295] In 2014, Lopez stated, ""There's this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy (...) It's the craziest thing I've ever heard... The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.""[131]  Lopez is a tabloid fixture[296][297] and has admitted to having a ""less-than-perfect"" public image.[298] The media often draw comparisons between Lopez and actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships.[299][300] In fact, Lopez has been dubbed a ""modern-day Liz Taylor"" by the media.[301] Lynn Hirschberg of W compared her glamorous public persona to that of Taylor.[302] Her style is described by Billboard's Lauren Savage as scantily clad.[303] Lopez has been criticized by the animal rights organization PETA for inclusion of fur in her fashion lines and outfits.[304] She has received a bad reputation as being a demanding ""diva"",[305] but she constantly refutes this.[306] In 2003, The Observer remarked that Lopez was ""the woman immortalised in a million headlines as 'Hollywood's most demanding diva' ... Lopez must wonder what heinous crime she has committed to become the most vilified woman in modern popular culture.""[307]  Legacy and cultural impact  Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[11][308] In 1999, The Record newspaper observed that she was responsible for the introduction of a Latina presence in the film industry, which was a ""whites-only preserve"" for much of its history.[309] Described as a ""multidimensional artist who had turned into a financial powerhouse"",[310] Lopez became the highest-paid actress of Hispanic descent in history.[311] Miriam Jiménez Román stated in The Afro-Latin Reader: History and Culture in the United States (2009) that ""[she] was able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries"".[312] In 2012, business magazine Forbes suggested that Lopez ""may be the most powerful entertainer on the planet"",[313] and named her ""the world's most powerful Latino celebrity"".[314]  Upon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the ""Latin explosion"" occurring in entertainment at the time.[315] Writing for The Recording Academy, Brian Haack described her as the ""breakout female star"" of the Latin pop movement in American music.[316] She was featured on the cover of the first issue of Latina magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating that there is ""no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer"".[317] Around the time her career began to burgeon, the emphasis on Lopez's curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States.[318] In August 2005, Time listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: ""Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy show. Today she's known by two syllables.""[45] In February 2007, People en Español named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer.[308] In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.[319][320]  Lopez is considered a global icon, and is often described as a triple threat performer.[321][322][323] VH1 ranked her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons,[324] number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music,[325] and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.[326] Lopez has been cited as an influence or inspiration by a range of entertainers, including Jessica Alba,[327] Adrienne Bailon,[328] Kat DeLuna,[329] Mike Doughty,[330] Fifth Harmony,[331] Becky G,[332] Selena Gomez,[333] Ryan Guzman,[334] Kelly Key,[335] Q'orianka Kilcher,[336] Demi Lovato,[337] Normani,[338] Pitbull,[339] Francia Raisa,[328] Naya Rivera,[340] Bebe Rexha,[341] Gwen Stefani,[342] Stooshe,[343] and Kerry Washington.[344]  Famed for her distinct style and fashion sense, Us Weekly named Lopez ""Style Icon"" of the 2000s decade.[345] The Green Versace ""Jungle Dress"" that she wore at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000 was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by The Daily Telegraph.[346] The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google's image search.[347][348] Her style has influenced a range of celebrities, including Kelly Rowland, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Love Hewitt.[349][350][351] Her record-breaking fragrance line has become the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion as of 2012.[352] Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, has been credited with influencing the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s,[353] with perfume critic Chandler Burr stating: ""Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive.""[354] Following the success of Lopez's appointment as a judge on American Idol in 2010, a trend of networks hiring ""big names"" for judging panels on reality shows ensued. The Hollywood Reporter branded this ""The J.Lo Effect"".[355]  Achievements  As of 2018, Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, including 40 million albums,[356] and her films have grossed a cumulative total of US$2.9 billion.[357] She remains the only female entertainer to have a number one album and film simultaneously in the United States.[358][359] With her second studio album J.Lo (2001), Lopez became the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to achieve a number one album in the United States since its inception in 1953.[360] Her album J to tha L-O! The Remixes was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the first number one remix album in the United States.[361] In 2010, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award for her contribution to the arts.[362] Lopez's return to prominence the following year with her single ""On the Floor""—among the best-selling singles of all time, and its music video recognized as the ""Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time"" by Guinness World Records in 2012—is regarded as one of the greatest musical comebacks in history.[363][364] In 2013, she was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her musical contributions,[365] and Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud.[366] In 2014, she became the first female recipient of the Billboard Icon Award.[367] Billboard magazine ranked her as the ninth greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016.[368] In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award.[369] In 2018, Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to claim the prize since its introduction in 1984.[370]  Discography  Filmography  Tours and concerts  Tours  Residency concerts  See also  References  Further reading  Gallick, Sarah (2003).

Singer Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016, in Burbank, California. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia Singer Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016, in Burbank, California. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia  The Voice will soon be back for another season. This time around Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani are the show’s coaches. Gwen’s return as a coach should be interesting now that she and Blake are further into their relationship. There are reports that this has had an effect on their contracts with The Voice and what the couple is planning next for their relationship.  Curious about what’s going on between them? Here are 10 things we know about their relationship.  1. They have recently released music about their divorces  Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images  Gwen and Blake were both recently divorced when they got together. Blake got a divorce from Miranda Lambert. And his new album, If I’m Honest, purposely starts off with a party song and then goes into sadder music, a transition that reflects his personal life. “That’s when it became painfully obvious that it wasn’t going to work out in my ­marriage,” he told Billboard. Although the singer has made a new album about the end of the relationship, there is still mystery surrounding what caused the divorce.  Gwen had a messy divorce from Gavin Rossdale after she reportedly found out he cheated. She came out with a new album that includes a single titled, “Used To Love You.”  “It was really a life-saver record for me,” she told Time. “It wasn’t until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, ‘God gave me a gift. I’m going to use it now. Because if I don’t, I’m going to die.'”  2. Blake’s divorce announcement on The Voice brought them closer  Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  When the two started working together they had no clue they were both going through the same thing. Then, Blake decided to announce his divorce.  “We were all mic-ed up and everything, and Blake’s like, ‘I gotta talk to you guys.’ And he basically made his announcement,” Gwen told Howard Stern. “He basically told me what was going on with him. We just started this friendship. I wasn’t trying to start a relationship. I was just trying to not die. There was no plan. It was an incredible gift to be able to have a friend.”  3. Gwen had no clue who Blake was before going on the show  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC  This is probably the case for many fans of The Voice who aren’t country music lovers. But it’s a little more surprising for someone in the industry to admit. Gwen revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, “I didn’t even know that Blake Shelton existed in the world! I had no idea.” She also had no clue what he sounded like.  He sent me this song in an email, and I was so scared because at that point I really didn’t know even what his voice really sounded like. Like, I’d heard it on the show, but I wasn’t paying attention. I was like, ‘Whatever, country guy’s on. When’s Pharrell coming on?’  4. They didn’t confirm they were dating until November 2015  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  In the beginning, there were rumors the two were dating, but they still kept it secret. Still, it was badly kept because there were photos of them getting cozy together at a Halloween party. Finally, in November, Blake’s rep confirmed they were dating to E! News.    5. Gwen and Blake are actually working like a team this season  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  It seemed unclear whether the couple’s romantic relationship would make them more competitive with each other or whether they would work together. It looks like the latter will be happening.  “We’ll be driving home at night, and I’ll be like, ‘Do you think I should put these two people against each other?’ and he’ll be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,'” Gwen revealed to ET. “I was like, ‘I don’t believe you! I think you’re trying to trick me right now!'”  6. They’re reportedly being paid more because of their relationship  Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC  It’s possible The Voice might see a ratings boost from fans hoping to get a look into the couple’s relationship on the show. Because of this, they are reportedly getting paid more.  “[Blake and Gwen] are getting paid an exceptional bonus that is significantly higher than the other judges to keep the spark alive on-camera,” a production source told Radar Online. “The producers really want to see Gwen and Blake in competition more often this upcoming season, versus working with each other like they have in the past.”  7. But they do have a breakup clause in their contracts  Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC  Of course there is a risk this plan could backfire. Instead of the couple being cute on screen, they could end up breaking up and might not want to work with each other. Well, the producers have a safety net in place in case of a break-up.  “And, of course, there is a stipulation in their contract, which is more of a break-up clause,” the production source told Radar Online. “If, for some reason, they call it quits, they are both required to finish out the remainder of their existing contracts.”  8. They have reportedly already finalized their wedding plans  Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images  This couple is all in when it comes to their relationship. They reportedly have already made their wedding arrangements. “They’ve met with vendors,” a source told Us Weekly in 2016. The source also claimed they want to get married “before the end of the year.” So even though we didn’t see a 2016 wedding, one might be on the horizon.    9. It will reportedly be a $3 million Beverly Hills wedding  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People’s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People’s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images  There have been reports the couple decided to get married in Beverly Hills on May 5, 2017. According to OK! Magazine, they sent out invitations that said the ceremony would be at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Other stars, including Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland, have gotten hitched there previously.  10. They are putting the wedding on hold (for now)  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani during the NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium | Christian Petersen/Getty Images Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani during the NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium | Christian Petersen/Getty Images  The celebrity couple has reportedly been making big plans for their wedding in hopes to tie the knot this year. However, it looks like those plans are on hold. According to Life & Style, they want to do one more thing first.  “They’re trying to have a baby first,” a source close to Gwen revealed. “That’s their main focus right now. She’s determined to have another baby and carry it herself, even though Blake has said it doesn’t matter if they adopt or get a surrogate.” This actually might be a challenging endeavor considering Gwen had her three kids through vitro treatments. “Physically and emotionally, it was just a lot for her,” continued the source. “So she’s trying to get pregnant naturally for the time being.”  Follow Nicole Weaver on Twitter @nikkibernice  Check out Entertainment Cheat Sheet on Facebook!	1
Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have been facing dating rumors for the past four years but is the couple’s rumored relationship strictly physical?  According to a new report, Jamie Foxx has been accused of flirting with another woman, and when it comes to his dedication to the mother of one, an insider claims he treats her like a “booty call.”  On July 12, In Touch Weekly magazine shared a report regarding Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx’s alleged romance, claiming that while they’ve been linked since 2013, Holmes reportedly wasn’t on Foxx’s mind when he celebrated the Fourth of July earlier this month.  As an insider explained, Jamie Foxx attended the Red, White and Bootsy Party on July 4 and ran over to a slender brunette. He allegedly started dancing and flirting with the woman right away. According to the report, Foxx appeared to be a real ladies’ man during the event and didn’t care who was watching.  Despite being linked to Katie Holmes for years, Jamie Foxx reportedly acts like a frat boy when he goes out, and his rumored relationship with the actress becomes an afterthought. Meanwhile, the source claims Katie Holmes is in love with Jame Foxx and hopes to marry him one day.  “Jamie treats her like a booty call. He just won’t commit,” the insider claimed.  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reportedly experienced excitement when their alleged romance began years ago and would often meet up late at night or early in the morning to avoid being seen. Now, as friends reportedly grow concerned for Holmes’ happiness, the source claims Holmes is well-aware of what is happening between her and the reported playboy.  A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) on Jun 22, 2017 at 9:36pm PDT  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx haven’t been seen together this month, but last month, they both turned up in Century City around the same time. Although they weren’t photographed together at the time, an E! News reported noted that the outing happened five years after Holmes and her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, divorced.  A post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Jul 9, 2017 at 4:45am PDT  Katie Holmes shares daughter Suri with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise, and Jamie Foxx is the father of two daughters from a previous relationship.

Video  US President Donald Trump received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos as he took to the field for the national anthem during a college football game in Atlanta.  Critics on social media said it looked as though he forgot the lyrics of The Star-Spangled Banner, while his supporters said they were proud to see him stand.  The Flag Code makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung by those present. Singing it is, however, encouraged from school onwards.  Tens of thousands of college football fans attended the match between the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama.	0

Fans have always longed for ’90s golden couple Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to get back together — something Justin Theroux became keenly aware of two years ago when he found love notes Aniston had saved from the heartthrob, a source recalls in the new issue of Us Weekly.  “He stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” a source tells Us. “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already.’”  The source explains that impact of those little notes was huge. “Jen assured him they weren’t a big deal, but Justin wasn’t thrilled … Justin had moments of insecurity like that.”  As previously reported, Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, announced their separation on Thursday, February 15, via a joint statement: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux’s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, called it quits in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.  “Jen has struggled with the perception that she is this pathetic woman after the divorce from Brad,” the insider tells Us. “It played a role in her wanting to marry Justin.”  For more on Aniston and Theroux’s split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

Marvel’s Runaways are finally living up to their name.  The Hulu superhero series, from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl), returns for its second season on Dec. 21 and EW has an exclusive look at the new trailer above.  At the end of season 1, the titular band of teens, after discovering their parents are supervillains, finally ran away from home. “This year is much more the cat-and-mouse [game] and the two sides going to war,” says Savage. So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units. “It’s in Griffith Park,” Savage explains of the hideout, which is called the Hostel in the comics that inspired the streaming series. “It was originally built in the 1920s by a magician. It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the ’60s or ’70s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.” Adds Schwartz, “We wanted it to be our equivalent of, like, the Batcave.” Teenagers really need a place to hang out…even if it’s an underground dust-filled mansion.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  In the above photo from episode 4, the gang enjoys a candlelit meal in the dining room with Molly’s (Allegra Acosta) enigmatic new acquaintance Topher (Jan Luis Castellanos). “He is a character who’s from the comics,” Schwartz teases of the character also seen in the new trailer. “He’s not all that he appears to be.” Interiors for the Hostel were constructed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and were massive. “It’s the biggest set that Marvel Television has ever built,” says Schwartz. “When [comic co-creator] Brian K. Vaughan came to the set for the first time, he had tears in his eyes.” We’re pretty sure it wasn’t the dust.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  The Hostel even blesses the group with some new accessories thanks to an antiquated but full closet. “There’s the perfect wide-legged 1970s jeans for Karolina (Virginia Gardner) and the perfect leather jacket for Gert (Ariela Barer) and an adorable tiny tuxedo jacket for Nico (Lyrica Okanu),” says Savage. “So everything you’d want from every era is hiding in that closet.” No one wants to be dressed in sweats when you’re saving the world.  Marvel’s Runaways returns Dec. 21 on Hulu.  Related content:	0
Everything about Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez‘s relationship points to success, beginning with their respective empires across the categories of dance, music, sports, entrepreneurship and more, all the way to their joint couple name, “J-Rod.” Indeed, it seems that the couple has finally discovered lasting love.  While they have yet to be engaged as Rodriguez confirmed on the Today show this week, The Knot rounds up some of the reasons why this celebrity couple is on the road to lasting love.  Timing Was Everything—And They See It  Both Lopez and Rodriguez have been honest about their past failures with love—previous marriages and engagements included—and why they’re both ready now. “We have to take our time. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my past,” Lopez previously told Good Morning America. “We’re mature now. We’re grown ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.”  On Wednesday, August 1, Rodriguez touched on how age has played into the dynamics of their relationship in a good way. “To be honest, if this happened when we were in our twenties, it would have never happened,” he said. “It was just too much craziness. I wasn’t mature enough. You know, boys, we got to get our dumbness out of the way.”  They Share Similar Life Stages  Rodriguez also explained how they bond over the parallels in their lives. “We’re in our forties. We’re both from New York,” he mused on the Today show. “We both come from Latino backgrounds. We both have two kids. I think we’ve both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other—both the good and the challenges.”  Lopez echoed her boyfriend’s notes about their similar life stages in an interview with Cubby and Carolina in the Morning this week. “I think we’re both in a good place in our lives,” she said on the radio program. “Now at this point in our lives where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other. It’s like, where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help I’m really strong.”  They Sharpen Each Other  With dynamic and thriving careers, both Lopez and Rodriguez continue to look for the next derivative of personal and professional growth. “I’m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time, I don’t know, maybe ever,” she previously told Hola! “And not that I didn’t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I’ve been where I feel like we really make each other better. We complement each other, and there’s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there’s a different selflessness in the love that’s beautiful and different. And healthy!”  Their Modern Family Loves Each Other  “Honestly it couldn’t be better,” Lopez added to Cubby and Carolina this week. “The four of them are amazingly special kids. I mean, of course I’m going to say that because I’m their mom, but they are and they’re sweet and they’re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way. And they love each other, they get along so good.”  Their Love Story Was Meant to Be  In a detailed Vanity Fair piece, Lopez went into detail about the beginning stages of their romance. In fact, it almost didn’t happen. “It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” she recalled. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that… I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’”  Their first date was equally surprising. “He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she recalled to Vanity Fair. “I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I’m not. I just listen. So he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date.”  Secure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here.	0
This is the moment comedian George Lopez filmed himself 'urinating' on President Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood walk of fame - but the footage is not all as it seems.  The comedian was seen crouching next to the brass plaque on Hollywood Boulevard as a stream of water flowed from between his legs in the video published on Wednesday by TMZ.  However, on closer inspection Lopez - whose face was scrunched up in a mock grimace - was carrying a small bottle of water which he was using to mimic the act.  The comedian was seen crouching next to the brass plaque on Hollywood Boulevard as a stream of water flowed from between his legs in the video published on Wednesday  Lopez is well known for his jibes against the President and was last year booed off stage at a charity gala in Denver after his anti-Trump jokes fell flat with the crowd, who had paid $5,000 to $100,000 for tables.  One of the event's largest donors, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, was sitting in the front row and asked Lopez to stop with the anti-Trump jokes.  'George was asked nicely to stop making Trump jokes by a man in front row [Maffei] who just donated $250K,' a commentator on YouTube who was at the event said.  Trump's Hollywood star has been the focus of several protests since he was elected President.  Lopez (left, in Hollywood on Wednesday) is well known for his jibes against the President (right, after a NATO summit in Belgium on Thursday) and was last year booed off stage at a charity gala in Denver after his anti-Trump jokes fell flat with the crowd  In 2016, Los Angeles Police arrested a man who pleaded no contest to destroying Trump's star with a sledgehammer and pickax.  James Otis later told reporters: 'Upon reflection after my arrest, I had said I was proud and felt very good about destroying Mr. Trump's star. However, now I realize I was wrong, that I shouldn't have done it.'  He was given 20 days of community labor and agreed to pay $4,400, CBS News reported.	1
Harvey Weinstein has apologised for using statements by Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence in an effort to dismiss a class action sexual misconduct lawsuit against him.  Six women are suing Weinstein and what they call the “Weinstein Sexual Enterprise”, which they say includes his brother Bob and their co-founded studio The Weinstein Company, claiming they conspired to conceal Weinstein’s widespread alleged sexual harassment.  The plaintiffs argue that, due to the scale of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the producer’s “sexual enterprise” should be considered an organised crime group.  Lawyers for the Hollywood mogul filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Tuesday, arguing that it was “fatally overboard”, and would apply to “all women who ever met with Weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm”.  They pointed to Lawrence saying in a previous interview that Weinstein “had only ever been nice to me”, although they did not mention her adding: “Except for the moments that he wasn’t, and then I called him an asshole.”  Both Streep and Lawrence have spoken out against the motion filed by Weinstein’s lawyers, and the producer has since apologised.    Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meryl Streep, left, and Jennifer Lawrence have spoken out after Weinstein’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the suit. Composite: BBC  A spokeswoman for Weinstein said: “Even though Mr Weinstein has worked with hundreds of actresses and actors who had only professional and mutually respectful experiences with him, Mr Weinstein has directed in the future that no specific names be used by his counsel, even where those actors have made previous public statements about him.  “Mr Weinstein acknowledges the valuable input both Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence have contributed to this conversation and apologises.  “Once again, moving forward, Mr Weinstein has advised his counsel to not include specific names of former associates; and to avoid whenever possible, even if they are in the public record.”  In response to the motion, Lawrence described Weinstein as a “predator”.    “For the record, while I was not victimised personally by Harvey Weinstein, I stand behind the women who have survived his terrible abuse and I applaud them in using all means necessary to bring him to justice whether through criminal or civil actions. Time’s up,” she added in a statement.  Her comment follows Streep firing back at Weinstein, who said the action was “pathetic and exploitative” after his lawyers cited her saying she was never harassed by the producer in an attempt to shut the case down.  Lawyers Phyllis Kupferstein and Mary E Flynn wrote that this would include actresses such as Streep and Lawrence who have not made allegations of sexual misconduct.    They pointed to Streep saying Weinstein had always been respectful with her during their collaborations in a statement to the press.    They did not mention that Streep also praised the “heroes” who made allegations about his behaviour, which she said was “inexcusable” and an “abuse of power”.    Weinstein’s lawyers also tried to undermine the lawsuit’s claims by saying Gwyneth Paltrow went on to work with him again after he allegedly harassed her.    The original lawsuit argued the statute of limitations on the allegations does not apply because the alleged victims were under duress not to make the claims earlier.    Weinstein, 65, has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.	0
George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”	1

Ellen Page just added her name to the list of women with damning things to say about Brett Ratner, the powerful producer and director who was accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women in early November—including Olivia Munn. On Friday, Page told a few Ratner stories of her own in a lengthy Facebook post, detailing Ratner’s alleged inappropriate behavior toward her.  When she was 18 years old, the actress says that Ratner made a lewd joke about her sexuality during a cast and crew “meet and greet” on the set of X-Men: The Last Stand. (Page played the character Kitty Pryde in the film.)  “You should f--k her to make her realize she’s gay,” Ratner allegedly said to another woman in the group, Page writes. Page, who came out as a lesbian in 2014, says she felt “violated” by his alleged remark. “He ‘outed’ me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognize as homophobic.”  She continues: “I proceeded to watch him on set say degrading things to women. I remember a woman walking by the monitor as he made a comment about her ‘flappy pussy.’”  Actress Anna Paquin, who co-starred in the film, tweeted that she supported Page’s claims. “I was there when that comment was made. I stand with you,” she wrote.  Representatives for Ratner have not yet responded to Vanity Fair’s request for comment about these claims.  Page’s Facebook post, however, is about much more than Ratner alone. The actress also discusses sexual abuse in the industry at large, sharing a story about a director who allegedly propositioned her during a dinner meeting when she was just 16 years old.  “He fondled my leg under the table and said, ‘You have to make the move, I can’t.’ I did not make the move and I was fortunate to get away from that situation,” she writes. “It was a painful realization: my safety was not guaranteed at work.”  Page says she “was sexually assaulted by a grip months later. I was asked by a director to sleep with a man in his late twenties and to tell them about it. I did not. This is just what happened during my sixteenth year, a teenager in the entertainment industry.”  Page also points to other stars who have been accused of sexual abuse in the past, including Bill Cosby, Roman Polanski, and Harvey Weinstein. She then turns to Woody Allen, whom she worked with on the 2012 film To Rome with Love.  “I did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,” she writes. “I am ashamed I did this. I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because ‘of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.’ Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.”  In 2014, Allen’s estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a child in an essay for The New York Times. He responded with an essay of his own, denying the allegations. The allegations that he sexually abused Farrow first surfaced publicly back in 1992. Allen has never been charged for these claims.  Page also notes in her post that as a wealthy cis white woman, she has certain “privileges” over women of other backgrounds when it comes to protecting herself. She wraps her post with a rallying cry for the people learning more about sexual abuse in the industry: “Don’t allow yourselves to be numb to the voices of victims coming forward. Don’t stop demanding our civil rights. I am grateful to anyone and everyone who speaks out against abuse and trauma they have suffered. You are breaking the silence. You are revolution.”  Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe	0
UPDATE: Woody Allen has clarified his comments on Harvey Weinstein after originally stating, “”The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved.” “When I said I felt sad for Harvey Weinstein, I thought it was clear the meaning was because he is a sad, sick man,” Allen said (Via Variety). “I was surprised it was treated differently. Lest there be any ambiguity, this statement clarifies my intention and feelings.”  Woody Allen addressed the “very sad” Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal in a new interview where the filmmaker admitted that he was unaware of the severity of the claims against the producer.  “No one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” Allen told the BBC. “And they wouldn’t, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumors all the time. And some turn out to be true and some, many, are just stories about this actress or that actor.”  The director and the producer have a long business relationship: Allen-directed films like Mighty Aphrodite and Bullets Over Broadway were distributed through Weinstein’s Miramax, while The Weinstein Company co-produced Allen’s Vicki Christina Barcelona.  Mira Sorvino, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Mighty Aphrodite, recently opened up about her own experience with Weinstein, an encounter that resulted in “many sleepless nights.”  “The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved,” Allen said. “Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that [his] life is so messed up. There’s no winners in that, it’s just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that.”  Allen, who has similarly faced allegations of sexual abuse – including accusations levied by his son Ronan Farrow, who penned the New Yorker‘s expose into Weinstein – also voiced concern that the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal would result in “a witch hunt atmosphere” in Hollywood and beyond.  “You also don’t want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself. That’s not right either,” Allen said. “But sure, you hope that something like this could be transformed into a benefit for people rather than just a sad or tragic situation.”	0
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West wearing Balmain at the 2016 Met Gala.  A lot has happened since Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s Met Gala red carpet debut together in 2013. Babies have been born, the rapper signed a major deal with Adidas, thus causing Yeezy to grow exponentially, the reality star founded KKW Beauty, and that just seems to scratch the surface.  Last year Kardashian walked solo on the carpet, and that might be a possibility again at the forthcoming soiree on Monday.  FN is taking a look back at the couple’s bold looks from the fashion gala through the years.  In 2016, the duo dressed in head-turning futuristic Balmain ensembles for the event, which was themed “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.”  Kanye West and Kim Kardashian wore Balmain to the 2016 Met Gala.

The “Life of Pablo” artist donned an oversized bling-embellished trucker jacket from the French fashion house, ripped Fear of God Jeans and suede tan Saint Laurent boots complete with light blue contact lenses.  Meanwhile, the mom of three styled silver metallic T-strap sandals courtesy of Tom Ford with her sparkling Balmain number featuring a dangerously high slit.  The year prior, the couple rocked his-and-hers custom Roberto Cavalli by Peter Dundas gear. Kim wore a nude beaded gown boasting an open back and a long white feathered trai, while West showed off a burgundy velvet tuxedo with a matching velvet kimono shirt and scarf embroidered with burgundy silk threading.

West looked dapper in a black tux with a white shirt sans bow tie and patent leather lace-up boots. The makeup mogul was dressed in a black and navy strapless gown with a thigh-high slit and black T-strap pumps.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at the 2014 Met Gala.

"There’s a reason Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott are rarely seen together, the couple explained in an interview with GQ published on Tuesday. The youngest Kardashian is a natural in front of the cameras, but it's “torture” for Scott.  “He was whispering to me the whole time,” Jenner said. “He just doesn't like taking the photos.”  Jenner and Scott are new parents to daughter Stormi Webster, who was born February 1. Despite their official status as a family, the pair is usually apart in the spotlight: Where Jenner goes, Scott rarely follows. Jenner said it was a way for the two to preserve their relationship and Scott's comfort level.  “I know he doesn't like the attention,"" she said. ""That's why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won't come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don't want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don't ever see us together, that's okay with me, because we just do our thing.”  The “Kardashian Curse” was a topic of conversation for the pair. The curse is said to surround the celebrity attention that follows the Kardashian name, making even the half-sister’s best relationships unsuitable for the spotlight.  “That's exactly what it is,” said Jenner. “They come and can't handle it.”  Theo Wargo/Getty Images for Huffington Post  See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows  As for Scott’s take on the “Kardashian Curse”? The idea doesn’t make him nervous. “Man, hell nah. Nervous for what? I'm on my own island. So hey, come over there to Astroworld. I'm not into all the other shit. I don't get involved. I'm over here. Kylie is different.”  To Jenner, the “curse” extends past the Kardashian's love interests to anyone who hasn’t fielded criticism the way the family has.  “It's everyone around us that aren't used to it. And we're just like, ‘Oh, that'll go away in a day.’ I know these stories aren't going to matter, so don't even let them affect you, you know? I think you're correct.”  She added, “But it's not just men—it's friends, it's people who come and just don't know how to handle it. It's the negative. There's a lot of people who love us, but there's also a huge handful of people who don't like us.”  Jenner is a leading force in the makeup industry, selling more than $630 million in products in three years, according to Forbes.  Scott is a rapper best known for his 2015 album Rodeo and 2017 single Butterfly Effect, which has more than 365 million streams on Spotify."	1
Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking, drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance.She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:“They was all just right out there in the open drinkin’ and lettin’ their dogs go at it. I saw some smoking weed. Some were doing other things I don’t know. All those dudes had that baggy pants thing. They weren’t the types of people you’d expect that girl to be with.”According to the Secret Service, Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasn’t seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. Her parents have not been available for comment.Public records show she was released on her own recognizance and given a court date of later this month for arraignment.	1
"Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she ""would look for a senatorial run""  Other celebrities have recently floated political runs  Washington (CNN) Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.  The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the ""the political side of activism"" and ""would look for a senatorial run.""  ""Can I do a better job from the outside?"" said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. ""Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.""  When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are ""no further details to report at this time.""  This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.

Satan is a misunderstood guy who has been judged on his outward appearance rather than by “what he has to offer us as human beings” according to Miley Cyrus, who detailed her relationship with the devil in a Swedish radio interview.  Going as far as to claim that Satan is a “really nice guy“, the singer described Satan’s relationship with her as “fatherly and nurturing” before stopping abruptly and asking the radio hosts, “You guys are liberal, right? Uber liberal, right?“  After the hosts laughed and one of them said “Err, yeah, I guess you can call us that,” Cyrus laughed too and then admitted that “sometimes he [Satan] can be a bit naughty too. He can be pervy. But that is natural. It’s only religious maniacs who see a problem with natural things.”  “I have reached the point where my relationship with him is stronger than my relationship with my earthly father,” Cyrus said, making reference to her biological father, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Asked how Billy Ray feels about “taking a back seat to the devil“, Miley Cyrus said, “He doesn’t feel anything, I don’t think so anyway. I haven’t asked. But it’s not like my relationship with anyone else takes away anything from my relationship with Dad. It’s just different.”  Cyrus also claimed that she receives guidance from Satan “on a fairly regular basis.” Asked what kind of guidance, Cyrus said, “Everyday stuff. Normal stuff,” before explaining that Satan’s guidance is “better than Jesus’ guidance.“  “I’ve been there, done that. Jesus is ok. He’s boring, you know? He gave Satan a bad rap. Jesus is the goody two shoes with no life. I prayed to Satan last Friday. I was in a foreign city, I barely knew anyone. He spoke to me quietly, prompting me to dress like a boy.  “I went out into the street dressed like a boy and I just walked and walked, following his whispers. I found myself in a dark alley by some kind of industrial area. Two big guys, rough guys you know, they suddenly appeared and I don’t know, I guess you’d call it rape. They took me forcefully. Yeah, it was painful. But to be totally honest, the whole experience was transcendental.  “It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When they were both finished, I started straight into their eyes and said “Hail Satan”.  “I’m not sure they understood but they appeared calmed by my words.”  Miley Cyrus’s Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. After starting her career with Disney, the pop star reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.  Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the Swedish radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.  The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting Satanism as a viable religious choice for those seeking spiritual guidance.	1
Christina Aguilera celebrated the release of new album Liberation by donning a disguise and busking in the New York subway alongside Jimmy Fallon on Thursday’s Tonight Show. Midway through the episode, the singer’s eighth studio LP officially arrived, as Fallon told Aguilera during the interview.  Aguilera wore a wig and a face-obscuring hat for the incognito performance, which has become a viral staple for the Tonight Show; previous “buskers” include Maroon 5 and U2.  However, the disguises are pretty much for naught as, within 10 seconds into their cover of Aretha Franklin’s “Think,” it’s evident that the voice booming out of this subway performer is unmistakably Aguilera’s. Before the buskers even hit the first chorus, a throng of passersby stop and whip out their cellphones to capture the unique performance.  With the ruse obviously up, Fallon and Aguilera shed the costumes and continued to entertain the congregators with an acoustic rendition of the singer’s Stripped single “Fighter.”  Aguilera offered up a third Tonight Show performance – this time in Rockefeller Center as opposed to under it – with the Liberation single “Fall in Line”:	0
The most recent cover of The National Enquirer features a photograph of George Michael. He looks to be lying down with his eyes, closed, and the cover reads, “George Michael THE LAST PHOTO!” It also says “Pop Icon’s Suicide Note Found.” The problem is that this isn’t actually how the photo was taken. Our cousin site Gossip Cop, who has been busting bad dish for years writes, “This is a blatant manipulation. In actuality, the publication took a grainy, previously published paparazzi photo of Michael and rotated it 45 degrees. As a result, it appears as if Michael is laying dead, when in reality, he was upright at a dinner party when the picture was taken.”  Gossip Cop notes that ” The National Enquirer doesn’t explicitly say it is a ‘death photo,’ but that certainly seems to be the implication by the way it is abnormally featured.”  Additionally, the “suicide note” mentioned on the cover isn’t actually a suicide note at all. Instead, the tabloid put together “words from a series of interviews” that he gave long before he died. Within the article, the magazine admits that the photo was taken two months before he died, which Gossip Cop says is “likely only done to remove liability and prevent the outlet from getting sued.”  [image: The National Enquirer]  Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com	1
It’s been a decade since the smash hit “Mamma Mia” hit the screen, and yet director Ol Parker knew audiences still had the hunger for a sequel.  Parker, best known for writing the “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” series, was originally planning just to write the sequel, before Universal decided he would also be the right choice to direct.  With the film opening Friday, Parker talked to Variety about how Richard Curtis, the screenwriter and director of the original, played a part in pushing him towards the job, Lily James’ full commitment to the part and the famous sequel he was inspired by.  Have you been surprised at at all that there is still a thirst for a sequel even after ten years?  I’m grateful for starters. When I first got the gig I spent a couple of the first days terrified! Obviously we are here because of the enormous success of the first one, so I realized quite quickly that if I succumbed to the pressure that I would never get out of bed and would never write a word. So I just tried to view it that I got the chance to inherit these characters that people knew and loved and these songs and extraordinary music as well as these wonderful actors I get the chance to work with and not get too freaked out by the level of expectations.  When did you and Universal decide to make a flashback an essential element of how the story would be told in this sequel?  Prior to coming on, Richard Curtis wrote me an email and asked, “Random question — do you like Abba?” and I went, “Well, who doesn’t?” and that was like two years ago, and I thought he was going to invite me to dinner with them, because he knows everybody and that’s how he rolls. Then he wrote me again and asked, “How do you feel about writing the sequel to Mamma Mia?” So when I was trying to figure out the story, I reached out to Richard about how to tell the story after so many years and his brilliant daughter, Scarlet, who is also a writer and happened to be with Richard driving in a car said, “Well, you should do “Godfather 2,” and I just went “Brilliant, I’ll take it.”  I would never think to put “Godfather 2” and “Mamma Mia” together?  It is not often that they are mentioned in the same sentence — it’s not a comparison, it’s just a structural theft.  What was it about Lily James early on that made you think she could play a character that Meryl Streep had already played?  So she had met, but right after that, she went straight into doing publicity for “Baby Driver” and because it was doing so well they kept extending the publicity tour. Even though we were seeing some really great actresses, I was just waiting for Lily to come back. Lily is in life and art, completely uninhibited and just commits fully on screen.  Plus, she sang in “Cinderella” and had a lovely voice and what I didn’t realize is that while her voice was in tune and beautiful, I had no idea how well she could act with it. So she came in with like half a day in between the “Baby Driver” tour and I knew she would be brilliant but what I also came to find out was how nice she was. To me, one of the keys of casting the younger cast was casting people I really liked, because I can attest to having seen the first film and seeing that cast really unite and see that close bond they formed, I wanted that with this younger cast as well.  How did the Cher casting come about?  There’s a sports saying, if you aren’t playing offense, you’re playing defense, so if you are coming back for a sequel not be better but you have to aim higher and bring something else back in to the mix. So I wrote that part specifically for Cher in the script and when I handed it in I told them, by the way that role is Cher. I refused to contemplate anyone else being on the list. So we are waiting for a while, on Cher time — because Cher owns time. In the end, Ron Meyer just called her up and said “You’re doing ‘Mamma Mia 2” and she was like “OK.” It was a great day when she said yes but it was an even better day when the plane arrived in London. She’s also an absolute sweetheart, she’s warm and funny and was very lovely on the set.  Had you dealt with any musical directing prior to getting the job?  I hadn’t, but I was lucky enough to work with a lovely choreographer who insisted that we work together. I originally thought 40% of the film would just be his. We also had this brilliant cameraman, Bob Yeoman, and that was a really big deal when he signed . We knew we were in a different echelon with him and that was fantastic obviously. We were just having fun and no idea was too dumb.  What was your favorite musical sequence? Most challenging?  “Waterloo” was probably my favorite. That was enormous fun and we laughed a lot. Hugh was all in in that scene, we just laughed for four days. “Dancing Queen” was the hardest to pull off, all those boats and all those people dancing around the street with boats coming around the corner. Pierce, god bless him, he hurt his Achilles tendon, so he kept going, “Haven’t got too many left in me,” and then something would go wrong with a boat so we would have to apologize and he’d be like, “nope, all good.” So yeah, that was a tough one.  What do you hope audiences take away from this go-round?  It’s always hard to tell with sequels. I wrote the “Marigold Hotel” series and with the first one, people hated it in the U.K. but in America they really liked it. On the sequel, it was the direct opposite, really well-reviewed here (in the U.K.) and absolutely pissed on in the States. That taught me how much the sequel is seen through the prism of the first one and really can’t get away from that. I remember reading an interview with Meryl when the first one came out, saying “This is the type of movie the world needs.” God knows things have gotten darker since then, almost desperate times now. So if we can add any joy and lighten someone’s day then I’ll take that.  (Pictured at top: Christine Baranski and Ol Parker)	1
It's officially time to start brainstorming couple names.  Last night, low-key lovers Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx both attended the glamorous Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Awards Gala, and they looked so enamored of each other the whole time. Are things getting serious between these two?  For the Pre-Grammy event, 39-year-old Holmes looked ravishing in a floor-length red gown and dark red lipstick. Foxx kept it sharp in a navy blue tux, and while the two arrived separately, they were seated together and looked incredibly cozy throughout the night, smiling from ear-to-ear all the while.  Image zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS  According to People, Holmes tried to play it coy at the Gala, leaving the table before Clive Davis announced Foxx's presence. However, Davis pulled no punches, calling out the actress!  “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else,” Davis said, according to the source. “If you’re going to sit together what better night then tonight?”  Holmes and Foxx have been the subject of romance rumors for several years, but they've done a great job keeping their relationship out of the spotlight. However, they've been making more public appearances together lately, and we can't help but swoon over their relationship. They make an amazing couple!	0
Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley reunite (again)!  The 29-year-old xXx: Return of Xander Cage actress and the 35-year-old Smallville actor – who co-starred on The Vampire Diaries – shared a hug in a photo Nina posted on Twitter on Thursday (May 17).  “Ran into this guy who looks exactly like my old costar @paulwesley ! Wait…” she captioned it.  She posted the same photo in black-and-white on Instagram, writing, “Excuse me sir, you look familiar. I feel like we’ve met before. Maybe in a past life?”  The duo also got together back in December during the New York City snow showers. Paul and their other co-star Ian Somerhalder had a reunion in February as well.  Nina and Paul starred on the CW series together for six seasons before Nina left the show in 2015.	0
Just hours after the arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer, actor Patton Oswalt — whose late wife, Michelle McNamara, tirelessly investigated the long-cold case and wrote a book on the murders — appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers, opening up about what he said was her “dream.”  “Her book and the article that led to the book really amped up all the interest in the case and really put a lot of focus on this,” Oswalt said. “Not to discredit all the work that the police and the lab technicians did — it was her dream.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  McNamara was a true crime writer and journalist. Oswalt, 49, recalled, “She always said, ‘I don’t care about credit. I want to know that he’s in jail.’ And now he’s caught, the bracelets are on and it feels like this thing that she wanted so badly is now done. It just feels amazing.”  The Golden State Killer — dubbed as such by McNamara — was allegedly linked by DNA and method to 12 murders, 45 sexual assaults and more than 120 burglaries from Sacramento to southern California’s Orange County between 1976 and 1986 in California.  • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

James DeAngelo Sacramento County Sheriff's Office  Suspect Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested on April 24. He is currently charged with capital murder in four killings: the February 2, 1978 slayings of Brian and Katie Maggiore in the Sacramento area, and the March 1980 slayings of Lyman and Charlene Smith in Ventura County.  Police say, however, that they believe he killed many more people.  Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic  McNamara died in her sleep in 2016 at 46. At the time of her death, she had been working on the book. Oswalt promised he would finish the book for her, and earlier this year, the star — who writes the afterword — released I’ll Be Gone in the Dark with the help of other contributors.  “I was still neck deep in grief and suddenly a single father and not sleeping, but I knew that I wouldn’t be able to live and go on with life if this was left undone,” he told Meyers of finishing I’ll Be Gone in the Dark. “I basically begged [the co-authors] and the publishers to find a way and they were the ones to find a way and finish it.”  Earlier in the day, Oswalt reacted to the arrest in a video he shared on Instagram and Twitter.  “One of the more surreal days of my life,” he said. He added while sharing a series of tweets and videos on Twitter and Instagram, “She would be beyond excited about this. I think this is the definition of ‘bittersweet.'”	0
Rejoice, Julia Roberts is finally on Instagram!  The Oscar-winning actress, 50, shared her first social media post on Tuesday in which she showed off her iconic smile while wearing a black sweatshirt reading “Love.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Hello☀,” Roberts wrote in the caption.  While this is the mother of three’s first time sharing a social media post of her own, it’s far from the first time she’s been featured on other celebrity Instagrams.  Roberts made an appearance of plenty of Instagram pages last month after attending Taylor Swift’s show at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.  Rebel Wilson, Amber Rose and Entertainment Tonight host Carly Steel all took selfies with the actress.  Roberts’ Instagram account is surprising as she told Marie Claire in 2013 that she thought social media as an “appealing” yet “sticky” cotton candy.  “[Social media is] kind of like cotton candy: It looks so appealing and you just can’t resist getting in there, and then you just end up with sticky fingers and it lasted an instant,” she said.  “There’s an anonymity that makes people feel safe to participate in hatefulness,” Roberts continued. “I like a good old-fashioned fistfight if people are pissed off at each other. I just feel like if you’re really mad and want to have a fight, then put your dukes up.”	0

Things seem to be going well for Blac Chyna, 29, and boyfriend YBN Almighty Jay, 18, as the pair were seen packing on the PDA  The former reality TV star paired the booty enhancing garment with a tight brown crop top that showed off Blac's assets - and even revealed the outline of her twin nipple rings underneath.  The model -whose real name is Angela Renee White- wore her curly raven tresses pulled back in a tight pony tail and her wrists and fingers were covered in jewelry.  Her rapper beau meanwhile looked slick in a Dolce & Gabana Millennials sweatsuit and a pair of Nike high tops.

Chyna declined to publicly respond to this message, and the fourth finger of her left hand has been bare in the intervening time, which suggests either that the proposal was just for laughs or that she turned the rapper down.

"With only a few days left in the year, Khloé Kardashian, aka the clap back queen of 2018, is still working hard to defend her title.  Khloé decided a post a picture of her and her mom last night with a sweet caption about how much she appreciates Kris, saying ""♚ You are a Queen who has raised multiple mini Queens still trying to be as strong and fabulous as you are! I will love you more and more everyday Until the end of time ♚.""  But of course, the internet being the internet, Khloé's followers decided to leave some pretty unnecessary/rude comments rather than bask in the mother/daughter love, and Khloé was NOT having it.  First, a user commented, ""would you keep IG if all photo editing apps were gone forever??? Lol."" Khloé responded with, ""would you? Sometimes I wonder why people comment if it adds no value to ones life? Maybe I'm just different...but I don't care to be negative or passive aggressive. Our world is toxic enough as it is. It's sad people care to criticize something like an editing app. Let it go babes. Say something nice or just let it go. How does this serve you love?""  Instagram  And because that wasn't enough, another user decided to take it on themselves to remind Khloé that she also had a brother, as if that's something that she would forget. The person commented, ""It's a shame Rob Kardashian is a member of the family and he is NEVER mentioned!!!""  Khloé's reply? ""my bother is my entire world! He is definitely a king 👑 it is a shame that can respect us for respecting his privacy. You should not comment if you truly aren't informed about our family.""  Instagram  How many times will this happen before trolls learn that you do NOT want to come for Khloé—she will 100% slam you for it."	0
ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1
Fighting back. Renee Zellweger’s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.  The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing “sexual favors” for Weinstien, 65.  “If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit,” a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.  Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: “Mr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It’s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It’s simply not true.”  As previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expośes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy. The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood.  Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6.  “Georgina is doing very well. She’s an amazing mother. She’s an amazing woman,” the Charmed alum, 44, said. “I think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She’s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to. She’s a good woman.”  Chapman shares two children, India, 7, and Dashiell, 4, with Weinstein, who she wed in 2007.

Actor calls former co-star’s remarks about ‘spectrum of behaviour’ in sexual misconduct ‘Orwellian’ and questions defence of disgraced comedian Louis CK  The actor Minnie Driver has told the Guardian that men “simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level” and should not therefore attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women.    Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill to spearhead fight against harassment in Hollywood Read more  Driver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”.  Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”    He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’”  In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously?    “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.”  Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.”  On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape.  Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response.  “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ”  Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon.  “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.”  The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP  “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.”  Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.  “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.”  She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other.  “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.  Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more  “How about: it’s all fucking wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.”  Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein.  “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.”  Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women.  “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question.  “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse.

ABC has renewed “Modern Family” for two more seasons of 22 episodes each, TheWrap has learned.  The hit family comedy has officially been renewed through Season 10, which will air in the 2018-19 season. The order will bring the series to a staggering total of 232 episodes.  The news comes after months of negotiations between the network, producers 20th Century Fox Television and the cast, whose previous deals expired at the end of Season 8, though a renewal was likely always in the cards given the show’s success in the ratings.  Also Read: 'Scandal' to End After Season 7  “Modern Family has been the centerpiece of our comedy brand for eight seasons and we are thrilled to have it on our schedule for two more years. Steve and Chris have created such endearing characters, and the cast is second-to-none,” said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey in a statement.  “We are beyond thrilled that we get to spend more time with these characters, these amazing actors, our ridiculously-talented writers and our incredible crew – all of whom are like family to us. And the good kind of family, not the kind that argues with you all the time,” added co-creator and executive producer Steve Levitan.  Also Read: ABC Closes Deal to Revive 'American Idol'  “Modern Family” joins the Shondaland dramas “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder” and the long-running comedy “The Middle” as the five ABC shows already renewed.

The news comes as the broadcast networks begin to finalize their fall programming slates ahead of the upfront presentations next week. ABC also recently announced that it will revive the Fox reality singing competition series “American Idol” next season.	0
"Pauley Perrette is leaving ""NCIS"" after 16 years and 15 seasons. The actress, who played forensic specialist Abby Sciuto, will sign off after the current season wraps.  On Wednesday, she cleared the air about her departure on Twitter and emphasized that there is no drama behind her decision.  She wrote: ""There has been all kinds of false stories as to why (NO I DON'T HAVE A SKIN CARE LINE AND NO MY NETWORK AND SHOW ARE NOT MAD AT ME!) It was a decision made last year.

“I love romantic comedies. I feel almost sheepish writing that, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years or so that admitting that you like these movies is a form of mild stupidity… I enjoy watching people fall in love on-screen so much that I can suspend my disbelief for the contrived situations that only happen in the heightened world of romantic comedies.” —Mindy Kaling, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?  At the end of its second season, The Mindy Project has become one of those shows that inspires strong reactions on either side, and very few in the middle. If you scout out Mindy Project reviews (wait, I’ve done it for you!), you’ll find both total pans (“The Mindy Project fails at everything it attempts”) and complete raves (“Why only an idiot would miss out on TV’s funniest comedy”). I fall closer to the latter on the scale, but I understand the former. I don’t really care if Mindy’s likable or not, as long as she’s entertaining, but some of her actions are insane (tracing her one-night stand to his workplace, a first-grade classroom) or ignorant (a medical doctor who doesn’t know what “condo” stands for?) enough to take the viewer out of the actual show to ponder, “Why am I watching this person?” When the show does stumble (“L.A.,” or the recent ill-scheduling of “Girl Crush”), it takes at least a week or so to right itself.  Advertisement  But when it realigns, The Mindy Project becomes one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV. Todd VanDerWerff points out that although the show seems to be in a constant state of transition, at least its trajectory is skewing upward, with a big leap forward between this season and last. I would probably watch it for the one-liners and absurdist asides (like the stalker raccoon) alone, but I also appreciate Mindy Kaling’s overall mission: To draft her own brand of romantic comedy. From the show’s first episodes, it established that Dr. Mindy Lahiri only wants to be Meg Ryan in a movie with Tom Hanks, as idealistic and unrealistic as that sounds. Her real-life counterpart has studied these rom-com tropes as well, so nods to the Nora Ephron canon (like “You’ve Got Sext”) abound in her scripts. She’s writing within the mold while redefining it: The saga of Mindy and Danny has contained some of the show’s finest work, as a hot in-air kiss led to a short yet delightful relationship, a too-quick and devastating breakup, and a hesitant walk toward each other again.  Heading into the finale, I fully expected Mindy and Danny to end up together (the episode title is a dead giveaway), but wondered how Kaling would make it memorable, meaningful, and most of all, funny. Fortunately, she pulled off this particular hat-trick. The episode features an absolute treasure trove of hilarious lines (I could list them all in stray observations, but that would be this entire review) strewn throughout the plot that finally brings Mindy and Danny together. This storyline not only utilizes the entire supporting cast for once (Zoe Jarman, we hardly knew ye), but it also uses Kaling’s rom-com curation as an actual plotting device. Pile on devastating performances by Kaling and Chris Messina, especially, and you have one of my favorite episodes of the year.  Danny pretending to be Mindy’s mysterious train admirer honors You’ve Got Mail, but also The Shop Around The Corner, the movie on which it was based. He knows her well enough to know that the promise of perfect romance will be enough to make her dump her real relationship with Detective Charlie. Danny suggests they meet on the top of the Empire State Building—add An Affair To Remember by way of Sleepless In Seattle—where he will reveal that he has loved her all along. After a slight derail, he visits her when she’s sick (You’ve Got Mail again), while offering to watch the ultimate film study in friendship-leading-to-romance: When Harry Met Sally (He: “I’ll order whatever gave her an orgasm!” She: “You paraphrased one of the most famous lines pretty well!”). Then, in a Danny voiceover, he takes her all over New York, “visiting any place that Meg Ryan ever laugh-cried.”  Advertisement  I cite Messina’s performance because although he tells Morgan and Tamra and Mindy his true feelings this episode, he has not voiced them since the breakup. But for the last four or five episodes, we still have known—by his frequent smoldering looks, attempts to work his way back into Mindy’s life, and just his ready acceptance to go get breakfast with her and be late for work.  When the entire office staff gets pulled in to lead Mindy and Danny back to each other, it works so well I wish they’d been used more throughout the entire season. Morgan has always been the office’s unsung MVP, as he figures out Danny’s secret plan (Danny asks, “How did you figure it out?”, then realizes he’s talking to Morgan: “How did you figure it out?”). Jeremy was awesome with his waivers, as was Peter with his final pep talk this season as he proves to Mindy that Danny still loves her.  So Mindy and Danny both race to the Empire State, and in one of my favorite bits of the episode, Danny gets hit by a car, yet still hobbles off. This is a hilarious nod to An Affair To Remember (which I will not spoil in case you haven’t seen it, but really, you should see it). Danny and Mindy reunite, and all is right with the sitcom world.  Advertisement  It’s such a perfect finale, I almost wish the show hadn’t been renewed. But then there would be no more Mindy Project, which would be a real disappointment. That’s the thing about rom-coms: The ending is always the same. But Mindy and Danny’s journey to get there was such an enjoyable trip. The challenge for season three will be to keep the momentum going into Danny and Mindy’s actual relationship, without contrived breakups or third-party romantic obstacles. This finale points to the possibility that The Mindy Project could pull it off.  Finale grade: A  Season grade: B  Stray observations:  On the train, Mindy’s coworkers are having a boring conversation about street mimes: “Mimes don’t even talk!”  For the record, Katie Holmes is six months older than Mindy Kaling.  I fervently hope Tim Daly is on the list for Emmy-nominated guest stars this year. Even his final scene is killer: He chastises Mindy for describing herself as a prostitute again (she shakes her head and agrees, “I know, I know”), then walks out of their breakup like a boss without ever acknowledging that he may have any flaws. I miss him already.  Loved Morgan’s dawning look of realization about Mindy’s “Mindy2ndaccount@hotmail” email address. And his sarcastic nods to Danny about honesty.  Also, Beverly covering her ears so she won’t have to hear Jeremy’s catfish story about the man with no torso again.  The title of Danny’s fake emails to Mindy: “what if… ,” “hello,” “today,” “coffee,” “good times.”  Morgan explains why Mindy should know Danny loves her: “He laughs at all of your jokes, and let’s face it, comedy is not your strong suit.”  The elevator guy sends Mindy up 104 floors seconds before the elevators start working again.  “You’re killing me, Bradley Cooper! What is this, a 20-piece suit?”  “Danny, who did I mail my underwear to?”  I starting reviewing The Mindy Project about midway through this season; I was not a huge fan of the show’s early episodes, but by the time Adam Pally showed up, it began to win me over. It was a lot of fun to write about; thanks for reading!	0

"Karrueche Tran Judge Grants 5 Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  Karrueche Tran Granted Five Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  EXCLUSIVE  12:01 PM PT -- The judge just sided with Tran ... ordering the restraining order stay in place for the next 5 years. Chris Brown threatened violence against his ex-GF after they broke up, demanding she give back money and gifts he had given her during their relationship ... this according to Karrueche Tran's in-person testimony in court.  Karrueche took the stand Thursday in her restraining order case against Chris, telling a judge after she broke up with the singer ... he demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned. When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.  Karrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.""  She claims he also texted her more violent threats like ...

Karrueche told Gammill she never planned to return the rings because they were hers. Gammill also brought up the point of Karrueche never reporting any of the alleged behavior to authorities.  Karrueche insists she fears for her safety and needs permanent protection. Chris wasn't in court today and the judge refused to let him join the hearing via phone."	1
"Let's face it. The franchise just hasn't been the same since fan favorite NeNe Leakes departed The Real Housewives Of Atlanta after Season 7. But alas the OG peach is returning to the reality series for Season 10 with more fierceness and shadiness than ever before. But after two seasons have come and gone without her, you may be wondering: why is NeNe coming back to RHOA now?  The explanation for her return is quite simple. NeNe says that she's rejoining the cast for the benefit of her loyal fans. After the network made the official announcement in June 2017 that she was returning to the hit series, NeNe took to Bravo's The Daily Dish in praise of what all of the RHOA love has meant to her over the years. ""I just want to be the person to finally say to my fans who have supported me for so many years... I'm back and ready for Season 10. Let the shade begin, hunni!"" she said.  Fans first met the outspoken NeNe in the very first season of RHOA. With her blonde hair and dramatic personality she turned heads whenever she entered a room. From the beginning of the series she was a favorite, as she never hesitated to say exactly what was on her mind. She provided the utmost entertainment through her many witty quotes, comebacks, and side-eye before letting fans know that she sadly wouldn't return for season 8. Though, many fans have continued using her dramatic GIFS, memes, and one-liners in her absence. So she was gone, but not forgotten.  In 2015 she told People that leaving the show felt like a weight had ""been lifted off of [her] shoulders."" That's no surprise being that most of the drama and arguments centered around NeNe. But in her defense she didn't start all of them. Nonetheless, NeNe officially traded in her peach in 2015.  “This was definitely a hard decision for me,” Leakes told People at the time. “Me and my husband [Gregg Leakes] have been going back and forth on it for weeks now. But my contract is up and I just think this is the right time. This is my opportunity to spread my wings and do different things.” The announcement for her departure came on the heels of news that Leakes would be focusing on other projects. She had previously guest starred on the hit FOX series Glee and NBC's The New Normal. Soon after leaving RHOA she made her Broadway debut as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella, alongside actress Keke Palmer.  But regardless of why she originally left the reality series, longtime RHOA viewers are super excited to see NeNe back in the group. She'll be reuniting with fellow Housewives Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Shereé Whitfield, and Porsha Williams. Also returning to the show, both in a part-time capacity, are Kim Zolciak-Biermann and newcomer model-actor Eva Marcille. Kim was an original Housewife along with NeNe, but unlike Kim, NeNe will resume her place as a full-time Housewife when the series returns on Sunday, Nov. 5.  NBC/Bravo  ""I am back and of course the haters know I'm here,"" NeNe says in Season 10 trailer, which means Atlanta (and particularly Porsha) better watch out. In an exclusive sneak peek on Entertainment Tonight, NeNe wastes no time inserting herself back into the drama when she candidly confronts Porsha over some nasty comments and bad blood at Cynthia's 50th birthday party. And anyone who remembers NeNe's previous seasons on the show knows that she's not one to back down from a (verbal) fight.  So how will this crew of Southern Belles get along with NeNe back in the building? Find out when RHOA returns for Season 10."	0

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  They’ll take part in a number of traditions. Guests usually arrive in the early afternoon on Christmas Eve and exchange gifts. After their church outing on the big day, the royal family heads back to Sandringham House for a lunch of Norfolk turkey and other festivities.  Can’t get enough of PEOPLE’s Royals coverage? Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!  Meghan Markle at Christmas 2017 Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  Meghan joined the royal family for their Christmas celebrations last year, despite it being unusual for non-married partners of senior members of the family to join the Queen for Christmas Day celebrations. Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. — and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fiancée by his side.  Despite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate’s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family. They will stay at their nearby home of Anmer Hall with children Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and 8-month-old Prince Louis.  Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at Christmas 2017 Chris Jackson/Getty  RELATED: Christmas with the Royals! Every Photo You Need to See of the Royal Family Getting Festive  Claims have swirled about tension between brothers William and Harry and their wives, Kate and Meghan. But contrary to those reports, a source tells PEOPLE that the couples enjoyed a memorable first Christmas together last year, when Meghan made her debut walk to church with the royal family on Christmas Day.  “They really loved Christmas and all had a wonderful time,” the source says. “I think the two women got on — they are definitely not best friends, but it was a really special time for them all to spend together.”  Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Doria Ragland BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty  One person who won’t be joining in the festivities? Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland.  Despite previous reports that Doria was invited to spend Christmas with the royal family, PEOPLE confirms that the Los-Angeles based yoga instructor and social worker will not be in Norfolk.  The Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Kate and William decided to skip spending Christmas at Sandringham in 2016. Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate’s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.  The news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year. Doria may have rooms set aside for her in the cottage, located close to the house where Harry and Meghan’s evening wedding party was held and where their engagement photos were taken about a year ago, but she’s not making a permanent move there.	0
"Bruce Jenner is reportedly upset that American reality television star Kim Kardashian is treating her daughter North West like an ""accessory.""  According to Hollywood Life, the 65-year-old former Olympian is against the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taking the 19-month-old toddler around the world, including in the front row at fashion shows.  ""He wants North to be a kid. To go to kid things,"" an insider said. ""She has no business being at a fashion show and he's appalled that Kim sometimes drags her around like some sort of an accessory.""  ""He doesn't appreciate how every time he turns around he sees his granddaughter's face plastered on magazines and websites. He hates it and doesn't want her to be exploited the way she is,"" the source added.  This comes after North threw tantrums twice during the New York Fashion Week.  The tiny tot burst into tears at father Kanye West's show with Adidas and the toddler also cried at the Alexander Wang runway show.  Meanwhile, it was previously reported that Kardashian feels North should not be banned from attending high profile events just ""because she's a baby""."	1
All bittersweet things must come to an end.  FXX announced that Stephen Falk's relationship comedy, You're the Worst, will be granted a fifth and final season to air in 2018. The announcement came November 15 - the same day as You're the Worst season 4's finale  FX co-President of Original programming Nick Grad said in a statement:  “Stephen Falk has been an extraordinary creative partner to work with over the past four years, and it is in that spirit that we came to the mutual decision to end You’re the Worst with its fifth season. Stephen’s singular vision for the series has been its guiding force from the start and our decision, while difficult, will allow the series to end on its own terms and in a way most satisfying to its devoted fans. We want to thank Stephen, the cast and the crew for everything they’ve done to make You’re the Worst one of the best comedies on TV.”  It may be a bit early to eulogoize You're the Worst (seasons tend to run in the Fall so we're about a year away from the series finale in all likelihood) but while we have the time, Gad is right: this was one of the better comedies on TV. What initially seemed to be a comedy about shitty people falling into something approximating love, You're the Worst evolved into a sophisticated exploration of mental illness, self-destruction, and general human imperfection.  Chris Geere and Aya Cash excelled as star-crossed lovers Jimmy and Gretchen and Desmin Borges, Kether Donohue, and Janet Varney round out the cast as Angelenos all damaged in their own way.  “Making You’re The Worst has been an incredible experience and FX Networks have been dream partners,” creator Stephen Falk said. “I am thankful to have the opportunity to be thoroughly judged whether or not we ‘stick the landing’ -- which is a thing people say now that stupid Breaking Bad had to end so damn perfectly.”  You know what that means. Jimmy and Gretchen are returning to Albuquerque for bloody revenge. Get ready!  You're the Worst Season 5 Release Date  FXX has announced the premiere date for You're the Worst's final season. You're the Worst Season 5 will premiere Wednesday, January 9 at 10 p.m. ET.  You're the Worst Season 5 Trailer  And here's the trailer!	0
"Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, and former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is an American-born member of the British royal family and a former film and television actress.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed-race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best-known role, Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.  Early life and education  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her ""dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.""[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Proctor & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a ""briefcase girl"" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: ""Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.""[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and ""actively re-positioned"" her character from ingenue to ""the show's moral conscience"" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her ""desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings"".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was ""Tig Talk"", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked ""everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years"".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as ""aspirational girl next door"", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and separated through a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55]  Markle was in a relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello for almost two years.[56] They lived together in their residence in Toronto.[57] Their relationship ended in May 2016.[56]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[58][59] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[60] Markle and Prince Harry met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] The press began to report on the relationship in October 2016.[62] On November 8, 2016, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[63] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[64][65][66] During a September 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke in public for the first time about her love for Prince Harry.[67] Later that month, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[68][69]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, where the show is filmed.[70] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[71]  Markle has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd named Bogart and a beagle named Guy, whom she adopted in 2012 and 2015 respectively.[72][73]  Royal marriage  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017.[58][74] By then, she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's paternal grandmother, several times.[75] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[76] The ring Harry gave Markle consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[77] Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[78][79] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[80]  In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[81] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[81] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[82] The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[83]  Public life  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[84][85] in connection with World AIDS Day.[86] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[87] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[86] Cardiff,[88] Goldsmiths' Hall,[89] and Edinburgh.[90] On February 28, 2018, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, ""Making a Difference Together"" with the prince.[91] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[92] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[93] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12, 2018.[94] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23, 2018.[95] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[96]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband attended Prince Charles' 70th birthday garden party to celebrate his charity work.[97] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018.[98][99] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[100] In June 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess would tour Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand around the time of the Invictus Games which will be held in Sydney in October 2018.[101][102]  Fashion and style  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored ""that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up"".[103] In her youth, Markle's ""sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style"" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers ""streamlined dresses"" with ""neutral colors"" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes ""monochromatic and tonal dressing"".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by many fashion designers.[103] The media takes note of the brands she uses.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108]  Charity work  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[112] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[113] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[114][115][116]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[117][118][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[119] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[120] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[117][121] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[122]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list 100 Most Influential People in the World.[123][124] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[125]  Titles, styles, and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[126][127] She is styled as ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"",[128] and she is the first person to hold that title.[129]  Arms  Ancestry  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[132] and on her father's side from German,[133] English,[134] and Irish settlers.[135] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[133] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[136][137]  Filmography  Television  Film  References"	1

If you always wanted to go shoe shopping with Sarah Jessica Parker (and who doesn’t?), you’re out of luck. The Sex & the City star launched a shopping excursion with Airbnb on Monday, September 25, and it already sold out in just two hours.  The $400 price tag for the “Sole in the City with SJP” experience scores you a chance to have the shoe designer help you handpick a pair of shoes from her SJP Collection at Bloomingdale’s, a post-shopping snack of fro yo and a ticket to the New York City Ballet show, along with facetime with SJP herself.  “What better way to meet than at Bloomingdale’s 59th Street, an iconic NYC landmark, for what I hope is an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience,” Parker, 52, explains on the Airbnb site. “I’ll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look. As we peruse the shoe department, I’ll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it. Next we’ll head to Forty Carrots for what some may say is the best frozen yogurt in NYC and we’ll chat about my city and why I’ve called it home for so many years. After that, I’ll send you off in your new SJP shoes to a special evening at the exquisite and incomparable New York City Ballet. You’ll have some of the best seats in the house, plus some VIP surprises. It’ll be a night you won’t soon forget.”  Considering a pair of her shoes retail for between $295-$545 alone, this is actually a great deal! The bad news is there were only four spots available and they’re already booked. The good news that all proceeds from the experience go to help fund the New York City Ballet.  Going shoe shopping with a celebrity while giving back to the arts is something Stylish can totally get behind. Fingers crossed SJP does more of these in the future!

Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz Kevin Winter/Getty  RELATED: Pregnant Rachel Weisz Jokes Her Baby Bump Is Really Just “Too Much Pizza”  Weisz and Craig, 50, married in 2011, just six months after they began dating. Both have children from previous relationships: Weisz has a 12-year-old son, Henry, with director Darren Aronofsky, while the James Bond star has an adult daughter named Ella, whom he welcomed in 1992 with ex Fiona Loudon.  The then-pregnant star also opened up about the pair’s relationship to the Times, saying, “I’m very happy being married, very, very happy.” She mused of the couple’s reserved nature when it comes to their romance, “We’re just really crap at talking about our private lives.”  Of her pregnancy, the actress said she was “feeling very dodgy for about four months, but now the good bit’s kicked in” during an April interview on Good Morning America.  Rachel Weisz  RELATED VIDEO: Rachel Weisz Reveals She’s Expecting First Child with Husband Daniel Craig  A film source told PEOPLE in April the couple’s decision to have children together seemed like a no-brainer.  “It’s not surprising that they want a child together,” the insider said. “They are both smart and secure and having a child is a natural next step even though both have children from other relationships.”  The source added, “They admire each other and want to keep their marriage alive and exciting. She is independent and their marriage is solid. Having a child is a natural desire. They have been married long enough to know each other which is a mature step to be sure nothing goes wrong.”  Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig Paul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan via Getty  RELATED GALLERY: Brigitte Nielsen, Rachel Weisz and More Celebs Who Welcomed (and Are Expecting!) Children After 45  The notoriously private couple largely keeps their relationship out of the spotlight.  “He’s just too famous,” Weisz told More for its the December/January 2016 cover story when asked why she’s decidedly secretive about their marriage. “It would be a betrayal. You have to protect your marriage.”  “When you’re young, you tell your girlfriends everything,” the star added. “One of the great pleasures of not being an adolescent is that you don’t have to share everything. When you’re married, that door closes. The audience goes, and you’re in your own life.”	0
"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you."""	1

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Aliyah Frumin  Mandy Moore is as confident as ever — and she says a large part of it is due to overcoming the struggles of divorce.  The 33-year-old actress opened up about her 2015 split from husband Ryan Adams, in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan. Moore noted she’s developed a thick skin due to a “combination of getting older and wiser and going through the hard knocks of divorce. You realize, I’m not going to take anyone’s sh--.”  Frederick M. Brown / Getty Images  Moore, who is now engaged to musician Taylor Goldsmith, added, “It emboldened me. There is power in saying no and in asking for what you deserve. There is power in knowing your value.”  And although her NBC show, “This Is Us,” is a now roaring success, there were many bumps along the way in her professional life as well, including three failed pilot seasons.  The cast of ""This Is Us"" during the 24th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on Jan. 21, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. Frazer Harrison / Getty Images  ""Before I got the part, I was making massive changes in my personal life and was looking to echo that in my work,"" she said. ""I was waiting for something different that would allow me to dig deep. I knew I was capable, but I couldn't get any momentum, and I had just been crushed by three failed pilot seasons.""  During the interview, Moore also weighed in on the growing number of women who have been speaking up about systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood.  “We’re having a real cultural reckoning — one that’s definitely past due,” Moore told the magazine. “Men have been using their positions of power to take advantage of women, and it’s so prevalent…I can only hope that what’s happening encourages more women [to speak out] and it serves to put women in more powerful positions across the spectrum.”"	0
The saga from Beyoncé’s album Lemonade continues.  Since the 34-year-old dropped her visual masterpiece some members of her loyal and often relentless fan base, the Beehive, have been up in arms about one particular lyric. In the single “Sorry”, which features a cameo from Serena Williams in the video, she sings: “He only want me when I’m not there, He better call Becky with the good hair.” With themes in the album revolving around relationships, infidelity and reconciliation, the rumour mill went into overdrive.  The Beyhive flooded New York designer Rachel Roy’s Instagram with bee and lemon emojis on Sunday after some accused her of being “Becky” following an Instagram post referencing “good hair”. A day later they turned their attention to Rita Ora who is signed to Jay Z’s record label, yet currently involved in a legal battle with the label.  Shape Created with Sketch.

The video made it clear that Spears isn't herself when she's hungry.  Britney Spears and her boyfriend Sam Asghari posted a video on Wednesday night which gave fans a hilarious glimpse at what the singer is really like when she’s hungry. In the Instagram clip, Spears and Asghari start off walking hand in hand down a hallway. As they walk, you can hear Asghari complimenting Spears on her outfit. But then she interrupts him and asks where they’ll be eating. When he says “steakhouse,” she gets a goofy expression on her face and runs off, to which Asghari replies, “I think she’s really hungry.”  Spears confirmed that in the caption of her video.  “I was freaking hungry.” she wrote.  Britney Spears and Sam Asghari have often given fans behind the scenes peeks into their relationship via posts on Instagram. They’ve become known for their couples workout videos which show off their physical fitness and affection for each other. Britney also regularly shares heartwarming photos of them looking very much in love.  In the past, Asghari has said that he believes that they were brought together by fate. He was cast in her “Slumber Party” video in 2016 and he told Men’s Health that his inclusion in the taping was a last minute decision as they had already hired most of the other people who were in it.  “I got a call at midnight,” Asghari told Men’s Health in July.  “It went through so much to get to me. I don’t know if it’s some sort of a blessing or just meant to be.”  The Iranian-born model added that he tried to be funny with her after she introduced herself by pretending that he didn’t hear her name. It looks like the joke worked though because shortly after the video was released, the two were photographed together by paparazzi. Based on what Asghari said to Men’s Health, it looks like they started dating very soon after they met because, at one point, he reveals they never had any intention of being friends.  During the interview, Asghari raved about his popstar girlfriend, praising her for her humble nature and expressing gratitude for her presence in his life.  “She motivates me more than anyone,” Asghari continued.	0
The Avengers really are one big, happy family.  On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the cast of Avengers: Infinity War proved they were Earth’s Mightiest Heroes by doing double duty, showing off their musical chops and explaining the origin of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  The song began at the beginning, and in the beginning, there was Robert Downey Jr. “Here’s the story of a playboy genius who was gearing up to form some sort of crew,” he sang. Downey was joined by a former Russian spy (Scarlett Johansson), a God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth), and one who “fought in World War II,” (Chris Evans).  In comes Chris Pratt, claiming Star-Lord as “the greatest to ever walk the Earth, by far.” Anthony Mackie and Benedict Cumberbatch sang their own introductions — a falcon and a magic doctor, respectively — while Chadwick Boseman kept it sweet and simple, singing, “Wakanda Forever.”  “So then one day all the heroes were assembled, to fight a villain who packed much more than a punch,” the cast chorused. “And this group was labeled the Avengers, that’s the way we all became the Marvel Bunch.”  The super crew got a last minute addition from the one and only Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who punctuated the song with a signature “Hello, brother,” thrown Hemsworth’s way. “Shut up!” Hemsworth pitched back from his own Brady Bunch box.  Watch the Avengers croon their new theme song above.	0

"Nick Cannon showed up to the finale of America's Got Turbans—excuse me, America's Got Talent, wearing a glamorous headdress and a bejeweled brooch, and I am...puzzled.  Getty Images Steve Granitz  I mean, I know it's the last show of the season, but Cannon seems to be taking the phrase ""That's a wrap"" literally.  Getty Images Steve Granitz  He is giving us ""Grandmother of the Church on Easter Sunday all dressed up for dinner at Golden Corral"" with just a hint of ""Punjab from the movie Annie but not really because although we love Geoffrey Holder we recognize there are some issues with this character."" It's...a lot. And, like Sally Field at the end of Steel Magnolias, I want to know why.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  You might think, Oh, this is just a wacky one-off. Some rogue stylist made a bold choice and Nick is just trying to downplay it. Out here like Daniel Bedingfield, muttering ""Gotta get through this..."" to himself. But, the gag is, he seems to be aware he's wearing a turban. And he wants you to know about it, too.  Getty Images Steve Granitz  First of all, Mother Cannon, I'm unclear about why you are pointing to the turban, as if our attention could be anywhere else. It is literally being held together by the North Star; we noticed.  Of course, Cannon has a propensity for pointing, even when it's not necessary. Take this photo from Red Nose Day:  Getty Images NBC  Photographer: Can you wear the nose, please?  Mother Cannon: I am wearing it.  Photographer: Yes, but it's supposed to go on your face. Like an actual nose.  Mother Cannon: I know. But this here is a nose finger. It's comedy. Ask about it. And I'm pointing to it so people know that this here is the joke. The nose finger. Scratch and sniff? Finger nose. Finger Cannon! I'm workshopping here. Is this too on the...what's the word I'm looking for?  Photographer: Nose?  Mother Cannon: Finger.  So, if you're taking notes at home for your Nick Cannon fashion journal, he sniffs at red noses but will turn up for a turban. And it's not a new development.  Here he is at the VMAs, in a sleeveless look giving you Aunt Joanne at the Labor Day cookout:  Getty Images Dimitrios Kambouris  This look says, ""My macaroni and cheese recipe may be suspect, but my bank account is on point.""  And here he is in a black turban, giving you Aunt Joanne in mourning for recently deceased president of the church usher board. Yes, he will be bringing a dish to the funeral. Why do you ask?  Getty Images GVK  Now, I watched Real Husbands of Hollywood, so I know that Nick is a shrewd business person who is rolling in cash, so he can do whatever he wants. He probably has a stack of hundreds shoved up in that turban right next to his Werther's Originals and his spare handkerchief. But I'm going to need some backup testimony before I can accept this turban ministry.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Right now he's giving me ""Glenn Close but no cigar"":  Like, is this the look? Is Nick Cannon slowly turning into Norma Desmond right before our eyes?  I mean, I would not mind that at all. It sounds hilarious.  But I suspect Mother Cannon has his sights on another grand dame of the screen.  This latest lewk is 100 percent Dominique Deveraux and if this is what Nick Cannon is trying to give us, I am here for it!  Getty Images ABC Archives  Here for this!  Here for that Professor Quirrell realness!  Getty Images ABC Archives  Here for this casual day look!  Not everyone will be on board Nick's slow but heady transformation into Diahann Carroll.  But I say ignore the haters.  I salute you, Nick Cannon. Live your ""matriarch of the family,"" ""it's too hot out here to be wearing a wig anyway"" truth. You keep that head held high!

"By Abigail Malbon 4 months ago  The public has well and truly fallen in love with royal bride-to-be Meghan Markle. Which must, by default, mean that Kate Middleton is jealous of her rising star. Right?  Short answer: no.  But, if the public speculation is anything to go by, you’d be forgiven for thinking so.  The Hollywood Gossip recently ran an article titled ‘Kate Middleton: Jealous of Meghan Markle?‘ in which they claimed that the Duchess’ upcoming third baby and lack of involvement in the royal wedding could mean “potential for resentment”.  Similarly, the Daily Beast wrote, ‘Step Aside, Kate. Meghan Is the New People’s Princess’.  But it’s not just the media. Millions of Twitter fan accounts are dedicated to Meghan, many of which seem to be focused on tearing down Kate Middleton in their wake.  The reality of royal life is very different.  9Honey’s royal correspondent Victoria Arbiter says there’s no truth in the rumours that there’s tension between the two.  “It’s interesting isn’t it? Society loves to pit women against women… so clearly because Meghan is suddenly so popular Kate must be cowering in the corner feeling sorry for herself,” she said.  “But I simply don’t think that’s how Kate operates.  RELATED: The biggest pressure Meghan Markle will face as a royal (post continues)  “She’s been in the royal fold since 2011, she’s done an incredibly good job...and I think Kate is very content with her role. She loves being a mother.  “I think she’s quite happy to let Harry and Meghan have the limelight at the moment, because it is a lot when you’re front and centre all the time, when you’re dealing with the press intrusion, public intrusion. And of course, in this day and age, when everyone has a camera phone, you really can’t ever escape it.”  The intrusion Victoria mentions was all new to Kate when she was introduced to the world as William’s fiancee in 2010, but flashing cameras and screaming fans are rather more familiar to former Suits actress Meghan.  (Getty)  While Kate had a family-orientated upper middle class upbringing in the UK, Meghan’s divorced - but loving - parents raised her in the USA. Kate went on to study at a prestigious British university, where she met William, while Meghan established her career in Hollywood. Kate married the man she met when she was a young woman, whereas Meghan is a divorcee.    But while their lives have been very different, the two women appear to be forming a close bond - one which, Victoria believes will be built on their unusual circumstances.  “I definitely think Kate will have been a tower of strength for Meghan,” she said. “And I think Kate will be offering Meghan everything which was perhaps lacking when she married into the royal family.”  Victoria believes that the public outpouring of love for Harry and Meghan might just be something of a welcome relief for the Duke and Duchess, who are about to become parents for the third time.  “I actually think William and Kate are going to be quite happy to take a bit of a step back, but also share the limelight with Meghan and Harry,” she explained.  The ""Fab Four"" - as they have already been coined by some - may have a world of pressure on their shoulders, but it seems more than likely that both Meghan and Kate are simply happy to have a friend to understand their unusual life path."	1

View Sample Sign Up Now  Many royal wedding enthusiasts had their sights set on Markle’s future sister-in-law Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge as the Maid of Honor. Others speculated that if the maid of honor title didn’t fall on Kate Middleton, it would have gone to Markle’s friend Jessica Mulroney. According to Vanity Fair, Mulroney is Meghan Markle’s “secret wedding planner” and one of her best friends.  Although Markle will not have a Maid of Honor, Prince William and Kate Middleton’s children Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have official roles during the ceremony. George and Charlotte were a page boy and bridesmaid at Aunt Pippa Middleton’s wedding in 2017. Newborn royal baby Prince Louis Arthur Charles is probably too young to be a page boy.

Keanu Reeves Shook The World With Another POWERFUL Message	1
Are Halle Berry and Keanu Reeves dating?  The two stars were photographed looking pretty chummy on the set of their new film “John Wick: Chapter 3,” sparking rumors they were seeing each other.  The Mega Agency  Gossip Cop, however, reached out to a Berry source, who shut down the reports. The site also points out that Halle has only been on the NYC set for one day so far, which isn’t much time to strike up a romance.  Meanwhile, Berry recently teased the movie’s opening date on Instagram. She posted a note scrawled on paper from The Continental in NYC. The message said, “See you in a year, Mr. Wick,” and included the caption, “It's a date. 5.17.19.”  It's a date. 5.17.19 A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry) on May 21, 2018 at 8:59am PDT  In the movie, John Wick (Reeves) is on the run with a $14-million bounty on his head.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are getting married one month from today.  Sorry, let us try that again, this time with the proper level of enthusiasm one should muster for such an announcement:  MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY ARE GETTING MARRIED ONE MONTH FROM TODAY! EEEEEEK!!!!  That's better, don't you think?  But even though one month is a very small period of time until the Royal Wedding bells ring, those close to Markle reportedly think it's not small enough.  They wish the wedding were taking place tomorrow.  Because then they'd only have 24 hour left to deal what one source is describing as the ultimate Bridezilla.  Yes, this source is looking at you, Meghan Markle.  “Meghan’s driving everyone crazy with her diva demands,” an insider tells Life & Style, adding of the bride-to-be:  “She’s a perfectionist, and she’s trying to control everything going on around her.”  This is the first time we've heard of Markle being described as basically anything other than kind, generous, loyal, lovely and loving.  Aside from those racist trolls who gave Meghan and Harry problems early on in their romance due to the former's mixed heritage, Markle has received nothing but positive reviews for over a year now.  Everyone seems to adore her!  But weddings do have a way of causing such stress and tension for those prominently involved that it's nearly impossible not to snap on occasion.  And those are just regular weddings; with, like 75 to 100 guests.  Markle and Harry will be getting married in front of thousands of people lining the London streets, as well as millions more watching from home.  According to this tabloid source, the former Suits actress feels a lot of pressure to follow “the rules of royal etiquette” on her big day, but is also “worried about her family being on their best behavior.”  This last part is a bit unusual, however, because we're under the impression that almost no one from Markle's family is invited.  Just last week, Markle's controversial half-sister spoke out and complained about her lack of a wedding invite.  ""Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to Family,"" Samanha Grant Tweeted about her snub, attempting to shame Markle into extending the invite.  So far, though, it has failed to work.  It is expected that Markle's parents will be in attendance, with her mom actually walking her down the aisle instead of her dad.  This is because Thomas Markle is famously shy.  He and Meghan's mother split a long time ago and Thomas now lives a very quiet life in Mexico. Sources have told The Sun that he's afraid to face the ""world’s glare"" on May 19.  But face it he will, at least in some capacity.  Just like those complaining about Markle's recent behavior, we're guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.  What about YOU?  Are you sick of all this Royal coverage?  Or do you wish there was even more of it?"	1
EXCLUSIVE: In a very competitive situation, Netflix has landed The Politician, a new hourlong comedy series from longtime collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow’s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt’s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan’s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox’s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  “I haven’t made a decision of where I’m going to go, I’m going to sit back and wait,” Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney. A mega deal at merged Disney-Fox or a streaming giant like Netflix, a production venture, possibly with Walden, are just a few of many possibilities as the uber producer plots the next chapter in his career.  Platt is known for originating the role of the title character in the Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen, which earned him the 2017 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. His credits also include the role of Elder Arnold Cunningham in The Book of Mormon, as well as Benji Applebaum in the musical films Pitch Perfect and Pitch Perfect 2.	0
Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Meghan Markle‘s dad is having a change in heart.  The 73-year-old announced Tuesday that he was going to try and walk his daughter down the aisle, despite his staged photo controversy — but was then forced to walk the statement back after learning from doctors that he needed heart surgery.  “They will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,” Thomas Markle told TMZ.  The former television lighting director has been recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which left him with a “seriously damaged” heart. Thomas was reportedly back in the hospital on Tuesday undergoing a series of tests.  He had come forward on Monday and said he wasn’t going to be a part of Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials because he didn’t want to embarrass her following the paparazzi photo controversy. But Thomas reportedly slept on it and changed his mind Tuesday morning.  “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle,” he told TMZ. “This is a historic moment.”  While Thomas initially thought the surgery wouldn’t complicate things, he said he now realizes how hard it would be to make the trip across the Pond.  In response to her father not making it, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released a statement late Monday saying: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas told TMZ that his daughter called him on Monday, but he missed the call. She reportedly texted him and said she loved him, was concerned about his health, and didn’t blame him for the staged photos.  The Daily Mail revealed Sunday that Thomas secretly collaborated with a paparazzi agency to set up the pics, which showed him reading stories about his daughter’s wedding and getting fitted for a suit.  Sources told The Post that he was “set up” by the LA-based company, identified as the Coleman-Rayner News Picture Agency.  They apparently took pics of Thomas drinking and entering a fleabag hotel — and threatened to release them if he didn’t agree to pose for them.  “They told him if he posed, they wouldn’t put out the other pictures,” a source explained. “They told him they’d make him look good. They also gave him a few bucks for his trouble.”  Coleman-Rayner did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment about the alleged setup.  While Queen Elizabeth II was reportedly “very angry” about the photo controversy, Thomas told TMZ he didn’t think she really cared at all.  “I don’t think the queen is thinking about what I’m doing,” he said.	0
"[This story contains major spoilers from the entire sixth season, including the finale, of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black.]  Orange Is the New Black had a lot to say about freedom, time and the current climate with its supersized finale — aptly titled ""Be Free.""  Jenji Kohan's prison dramedy ended its sixth season (which bowed Friday on Netflix) with a game-changing twist for the show's most dedicated viewers: leading inmate Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) was let out of prison on early release. Despite having eight months left on her prison sentence, Piper was pushed to the top of Litchfield's inmate release pile and she gained her freedom back in the final moments of the 84-minute finale.  Her season-six ending stood in stark contrast to the devastating sentences handed down to two non-white, less privileged inmates: Taystee Jefferson (Danielle Brooks) was convicted for the murder of corrections officer Desi Piscatella (Brad William Henke) — one she didn't commit — and will now be serving a life sentence; and Blanca Flores (Laura Gomez) is being transferred to an immigration detention center after mistakenly believing that she, too, was getting out on early release.  Executive producer Tara Herrmann tells The Hollywood Reporter that Piper's release has long been on the writers' minds, since Orange Is the New Black is based on the story and memoir of the same name by Piper Kerman, who served 13 months of her 15-month sentence in a minimum security prison.  ""Of course the thought of releasing Piper has come up in previous seasons because the real Piper's sentence was 15 months and we want to make sure that we can fully tell the story of what it’s like for Piper on the outside,"" Herrmann tells THR of what's to come. Orange has long been renewed for a seventh season, and will begin production later this summer. ""We just want to make sure we didn’t do it too soon in her complete arc as a series, but it seemed like the time was right. It felt like we had sort of seen her full time in accordance to what the real story was for the real Piper.""  Indeed, the real Piper wrote a memoir, inspired a TV show and now serves as an advocate for prison reform; she is also a show consultant on Orange. Herrmann says the prison dramedy plans to follow its Piper on the outside just as much as it did on the inside, and that season seven will track Piper's post-prison journey. ""She's the grounding force of the show,"" Herrmann adds of Schilling's Piper staying put.  Despite the early release surprise, Piper exhibited mixed feelings about her freedom. Not only does the idea of assimilation on the outside loom, but she's leaving her new wife Alex Vause (Laura Prepon) behind. To celebrate her release, Alex threw Piper a surprise prison wedding, officiated by fellow inmate Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne). ""As we were thinking of Piper on the outside, having them be married creates a lot more stories for us and possible conflict,"" says Herrmann about the relationship at the center of the show.  Brian Chamberlayne, who wrote the finale, said the wedding was emotional for the cast to film, since it doubled as both Piper's goodbye and the end of Schilling's on-set prison stint. (The episode was directed by castmember Nick Sandow.) ""There was a weird mix of emotion that day for Taylor’s last day shooting in the prison — realizing that she’s really getting out of this place,"" Chamberlayne tells THR. ""There’s excitement but there’s also a sense of loss, and I think that Piper is feeling that as well. That’s something I was trying to portray: the excitement of getting her freedom, but then also leaving Alex and this place behind that she’s become accustomed to.""  Alex, after all, still has four years left on her sentence. ""What's significant to come out of the wedding is that, in the way that weddings are for most people, it was a statement to each other and to the people around them that they’re going to try their hardest,"" says Chamberlayne of Piper and Alex's future. ""It might not be legal, but it was a big deal that they got to do that. Especially given how long it’s going to be before they see each other again, physically, and have physical contact.""  Piper's mixed feelings were evident as she watched the kickball game between the inmates of C-block and D-block play out, an activity she fought for in her final days inside — only now, she watched from the other side of the fence. When her brother, Cal Chapman (Michael Chernus), asks her what she is going to do next, she offers no answer and the screen fades to orange.  ""There’s that moment before Piper's release where she’s scanning the cell block and kind of just taking everyone in, and it’s a little bit like how you don’t fully get the understanding of a place until it’s about to go away,"" he explains. ""That’s when you take it all in, and Piper has that moment as well.""  Chamberlayne joined the Orange writers room in season six and, after writing the second episode of the season, ""Sh*tstorm Coming,"" he was given the momentous finale. Not only did the episode need to properly send off Piper, her ending also had to play out parallel to the devastating developments for Taystee and Blanca, two topical story arcs that feel personal in the writers room.  ""This is a huge episode for Piper,"" Chamberlayne says. ""That was really important to me, to Jenji and to the room that we did her a service by portraying her final moments in prison properly. Piper’s story in the finale, especially, and over the course of the season was the one that we honed the most in on to make sure that we were doing justice to her time in prison and showing exactly what she learned and how she’s grown — that she’s not that same person that walked in those prison doors.""  One of the scenes that both shows Piper's growth as well as how her story parallels to Taystee's was in the 11th episode, ""Well This Took a Dark Turn"" (which was directed by Prepon), when Taystee and Piper have a conversation about Piper's privilege in the prison hair salon ahead of Taystee's trial.  ""That was, as a room, something we leaned into as one of the most important moments of the season,"" says Chamberlayne. ""Especially for Piper’s arc in prison, to come out of it with this understanding that she got it hard in prison and people didn’t let up on her, but so many of these women have it hard on the outside and that’s part of the reason they went after Piper in prison.""  He adds, ""This contrast of her fish-out-of-water story, which is for minorities and people who are underprivileged classes, that’s constant. That’s the world that they inhabit every day. It was important to all of us to make sure that we highlighted that.""  Despite having the backing of the ACLU and Black Lives Matter, Taystee is convicted for second-degree murder in the death of Piscatella only moments after she explains to former warden Joe Caputo (Sandow) that there is no justice for inmates like her or the late Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley). As a former lawyer who worked on appeals for inmates who had received unjust sentences, writing Taystee's verdict was personal for Chamberlayne.  ""It's important to us for all the characters that we do justice to the people who are going through this experience, who are currently incarcerated or who are dealing with the aftermath of incarceration and what its effect is on their life, so the examination really is of the system,"" says Chamberlayne of reflecting reality through Taystee. ""We’re hoping that, through these stories, we can talk about the issues we have with the system and then also tell the human stories of these peoples’ lives and the struggles that they face.""  For three seasons now, the once-lively Taystee has been through a series of heartbreaking endings. ""Danielle is an amazing actress and we like to see her be fun — because she’s so funny as well as being great about the dramatic stuff — but you want to tell the story that’s true to that character and true to the world we live in. We talk about this a lot but you don’t have a choice but to get a little heartbreaking at times,"" he says.  Herrmann adds of the breakout character: ""We’re craving old Taystee but the reality is that this is what happens. It’s out of their control; it’s out of her control. She’s such a light — the character and the actress — so we always hope to show light and darkness. I’m confident that we’ll get to that place again, but for now, this is the reality that she’s living in. Just awful.""  And the same goes for Blanca's storyline, which opens the door for Orange to tackle the U.S. immigration crisis in season seven. The announcement that MCC, now rebranded as PolyCon, was moving into the business of immigration detention centers is a prescient punch — though it was written months ago, the new season dropped only one day after the court-ordered deadline to reunite separated migrant children under the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy.  ""Jenji came in at the beginning of season six stating that one of the clear things she wanted to do was address immigration detention centers — that’s something she was adamant about,"" says Chamberlayne of plotting the timely deportation storyline. ""We had spoken to some immigration attorneys and the way that Blanca’s story has worked out, it was a perfect opportunity to start to tell that story.""  For Chamberlayne, the ending came full circle. His first episode of the season, ""Sh*tstorm Coming,"" provided the first hint that viewers should be worried about Blanca's fate. ""The FBI agent is looking at her case file and saying, 'Wait a second,'"" he recalls. ""Then having this moment, it was absolutely heart-wrenching to write. The actors had really delivered in the way they play Blanca and Diablo's (Miguel Izaguirre) relationship, and I think it’s an important story to be telling, especially now. Very significant. I’m really glad that Jenji came in with that and allowed me to see it through.""  Herrmann says that Blanca's transfer gives Orange the opportunity to tackle more immigration-related storylines, especially since the show threw out its own timeline so it could play out in the year 2018. ""Things change every day, every minute, in terms of what’s going on with the policies,"" she says. ""So we hope to tell some of those stories in the next season, but because it’s ever-changing, we don’t want to get too detailed in true hopes that by the time our next season airs it’s a whole different thing. We look to be able to organically find these things within the characters and the stories that we’ve already created."" She adds, ""But immigration has been an issue here in the country since it was born.""  In addition to unjust sentences and the immigration crisis, Orange continued to shed light on the country's opioid epidemic with Daya Diaz (Dascha Polanco) developing a heroin addiction now that she, too, is serving out a life sentence for the death of C.O. Humphrey (who viewers will recall, was actually killed by Kukudio, who is now dead). Daya, in a devastating turn, now values drugs and her power relationship with her supplier, new inmate Daddy (Vicci Martinez), over that of any family members on the outside, including her daughter and mother, Aleida (Elizabeth Rodriguez).  Along with Daya, Alex, Taystee and Nicky, the following inmates are alive and ready to continue serving out their time in max come season seven: Frieda Berlin (Dale Soules), Suzanne Warren (Uzo Aduba), Pennsatucky (Taryn Manning), Cindy Hayes (Adrienne C. Moore), Flaca Gonzales (Jackie Cruz), Maria Ruiz (Jessica Pimentel), Zirconia (Daniella De Jesus) and new villain Badison (Amanda Fuller). Red (Kate Mulgrew) and Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva) are in SHU at the season's end, and Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox) gets out on early release.  Meanwhile, Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) has gone into a worrisome early labor and the villainous Denning sisters, Barb (Mackenzie Phillips) and Carol (Henny Russell), murdered each other, effectively saving the kickball game from turning into a deadly prison gang war. The season also provided glimpses at Lolly Whitehall (Lori Petty) in the max psych ward and a retired Sam Healy (Michael Harney). Caputo, who quit his job, is left morally grappling with Taystee's verdict and leans on new girlfriend Fig (Alysia Reiner), who provided an unexpected foil to MCC's Linda Ferguson (Beth Dover) throughout the season.  A handful of Orange characters, however, were still missing-in-action by the season's end. The season very briefly showed some of the inmates from the other bus from the fifth season finale — Big Boo (Lea DeLaria), Ouija (Rosal Colon) and Helen Van Maele (Francesca Curran) were sent off to a prison facility in Ohio.  But a handful of memorable inmates never appeared. Most notably, Janae Watson (Vicky Jeudy) and Alison Abdullah (Amanda Stephen), Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn), Yoga Jones (Constance Shulman), Leanne Taylor (Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (Julie Lake), Kasey Sankey (Kelly Karbacz) and Brandy Epps (Asia Kate Dillon), and, most obvious of all, Maritza Ramos (Danielle Guerrero). Chang's (Lori Tan Chinn) absence signals that the inmate who walked through the hole in the fence during the riot remains an unaccounted-for fugitive.  Both Herrmann and Chamberlayne spoke about the cast trimming that had been predicted ahead of the season, explaining why it was time to refocus on a core group of characters.  ""The change of location provided the opportunity, in that the first season is Piper being a fish-out-of-water in the prison,"" says Chamberlayne. ""We get to know all these characters around her, so it’s only fitting that when we’re coming to the end of her story in prison that we see those same characters that we met in season one in this new location where they’re all fish-out-of-water. They’re having to make new friendships and bonds and also learn how to survive in a different way. That was another thing that Jenji came in and said at the beginning of the season. She knew that she wanted to do that and I’m really grateful to her for giving us the groundwork.""  Herrmann has explained the Orange storytelling process of not leaving any extra ideas untold by season's end. Whether or not some of the missing characters will return for season seven will largely depend on what fits with the ideas that come out of the writers room for season seven.  ""If the story takes us there, it has to be organic for us,"" she says. ""We never want to suddenly be in a world that we haven’t set up. But we love those characters and miss them as storytellers for sure, so we hope to always see them.""  The 13-episode sixth season of Orange Is the New Black is streaming now on Netflix.

Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married — and they may be that way for a while if they don’t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family. We’re doing really well,” Garner said previously. “It has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.”  Reps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.

"Ivanka Trump is on the cover of the newest issue of Us Weekly with a story titled, ""Ivanka Takes a Stand: Why I Disagree with My Dad."" The subtitle elaborates: ""Balancing her personal ideals with love and loyalty to her father, the president's daughter will always fight for what she believes in.""  Interesting.

She reportedly even ""openly tried to sway him"" to remain in the Paris Agreement (which President Trump withdrew from last week).

"He reportedly hasn't seen her in over four years.  Tom Cruise supposedly hasn't seen his daughter in over four years — and that didn't change when she turned 12 last week.  Suri Cruise is now apparently desperate to connect with her dad and is tired of her mom Katie Holmes' excuses.  Tom, 55, has missed ""one milestone after another.""  “Like any little girl, her greatest wish is for her father to be there, and now she’s been disappointed again,” an insider told Star magazine. ""That would be painful for any child, and you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it’s taking on Suri.""  Though a recent report from Hollywood Life revealed that Tom did send Suri a birthday gift, he didn't show up for her birthday party on April 18.  And this isn't the first time.  “Tom hasn’t been there to watch Suri blow out the candles since she turned 7,” another source said. “It’s so sad!”  As Suri gets older, she's questioning Holmes, 39, more and more why her father doesn't come around. They haven't been photographed together since 2012.  ""Suri has to be wondering why Tom doesn’t come and visit. It seems like the older she gets, the more desperate she must be to see him,” the insider said. “Now that Suri’s older, [the excuses] may not fly anymore.”  Want to feel old? Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's daughter Suri Cruise is 12 today. — Alexis Benveniste (@apbenven) April 18, 2018  Reports suggest that the reason for Tom's absence from his daughter's life is his religion, Scientology.  When family members leave the church, people related to them who decide to stay are known for distancing themselves. So when Holmes decided to leave the church, Tom was expected by his fellow church members to stop talking to Suri as well.  Though he doesn't see her in person, supposedly, he does come through with a gift for every birthday and holiday.  Suri gets a gift from Tom on her birthday every year and this year was no exception,” a source claimed. “It’s not something Katie talks about though, beyond saying that Tom does always come through with gifts for things like birthdays and Christmas, she’s very tight-lipped.”  Emily Blackwood is an editor at YourTango who covers pop culture, true crime, dating, relationships and everything in between.

"AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me.PELOSI: My pleasure.AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan.Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.PlayPELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.PlayAMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.PELOSI: No.AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.PELOSI: Right.AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.PlayAMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?Is it worth it?AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it?PELOSI: Yes.AMANPOUR: Is it worth it?PELOSI: That's the question.AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you.PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year.AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you?PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely.Secondly, governance and ending corruption.....AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, ""Time"" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban.You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again?PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest.When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women.And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption.So what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governanceAMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forcesBIDEN SOT--- ""it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition""Does that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops?PELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops.AMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel.How does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.?PELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that.AMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House?PELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will andAMANPOUR: No matter what happens?PELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority.You had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen?PELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. And --(CROSSTALK)from outsiders perspective....AMANPOUR: -- because many people are asking that --PELOSI: Yes.AMANPOUR: ... how did you get to this place where, perhaps, you might lose your majority?PELOSI: We don't see it that way. We are very proud of the agenda that we have put forth to the American people. our recovery package, as the economists have said, we've had twice as many people unemployed as there are now if we had not moved forward. These actions are all controversial because we were digging our way out of a deep ditch.so we've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents.AMANPOUR: Are you nervous about November?PELOSI: No, I'm not nervous at all --AMANPOUR: Not at all?PELOSI: No. I'm -- I'm --AMANPOUR: Because people say I know you're putting on a great face --has you have toPELOSI: -- that's not.AMANPOUR: -- going into an election. But people say there's been considerable worry about what will happen in November.PELOSI: Well, let me say this. I never take anything for granted. And our agenda now is we're not going forward -- we're not going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration. We're going forward.AMANPOUR: So what does it make you feel, then, when the president's own spokesman said that you might lose the majority?PELOSI: Well, I -- you know, I --AMANPOUR: well how do you feel about itPELOSI: -- with all due respect -- I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another.AMANPOUR: But it directly impacts --PELOSI: Well, the -- they must realize that.But you know what, I'm speaker of the House. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilize -- mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two to one advantage money-wiseSo we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the tax cuts.Are you going to take that issue to -- to a fight before the elections, letting the tax cuts for the -- for the two -- 250,000 expire and then keep them on for the middle class?PELOSI: Well, the -- the tax cuts for the wealthiest -- of the $250,000 and above -- were the -- the Bush initiative. I dont see any reason why we should renew a tax cut that only gives a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America, increases the deficit and doesn't create jobs.That doesn't make any sense.AMANPOUR: But I know that's your position, butPELOSI: YesAMANPOUR: -- to the middle class --PELOSI: But to keep the middle class tax cuts--AMANPOUR: Would you take this to a vote before the electionPELOSI: It would be my hope. But let me just say, on The Recovery Act, nearly $300 billion of The Recovery Act were tax cuts for the middle class. most people dont realize thatThe Republicans want to have the tax cut and they want it unpaid for -- $700 billion added to the deficit for an initiative that does not create jobs.AMANPOUR: Can I show you something?PELOSI: Sure.AMANPOUR: there's so much polarization, so much partisanship, so much -- not just amongst the politicians, but in the press, amongst the people. You talked a little bit about what, you know, us and them, in your view. I want to show you this, which is a Republican commercial.TV AD//RIGHTCHANGE.COM (TAKE VIDEO CLIP FULL) AD NATSAMANPOUR: Oh, you haven't seen it?PELOSI: I have not seen that, but I have seen that in campaigns there isAMANPOUR: So what do you think --AMANPOUR: -- you being the -- the bogeyman?PELOSI: Well,-- what I know about that is that they tried this. This is their campaign in Pennsylvania 12, the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Their whole campaign was an attack on the president and on -- on Pelosi.AMANPOUR but it was youPELOSI: ...... and I said to to the president i think they may have gotten more focus here than you for this one time. And they fully expected to win the race and we won by 8.5 points. Because this is funny, it attracts attention, but they have nothing to say about what they want to go for, what they want to do is privatize Social Security. And as they have said, their agenda, if they win, is to go to the exact agenda of the previous administration and people will look with fondness on the Bush administration....we welcome that campaignAMANPOUR: -- for me, looking in from outside, it just seems -- that's seems to be a never-ending partisanship. What is it you can do for the people in this highly polarized situation.PELOSI well first of all, what you define as, you describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion. The Republicans are here for the special interests, we're here for the people's interests. The president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by America's working families. That is our priority. That is not their priority.This isn't about inter-party bickering. This is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side you're on. You don't like to think that. We come here to find our common ground. That's our responsibility. But if we can't find it, we still have to move. I've never voted for a perfect bill in my life. I don't think anyone has I wish it were not so stark. I wish the elections weren't so necessary for us to win. I really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground. Are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like? Well, we were digging out of a very deep hole. But we will continue to fight.AMANPOUR: Speaker Pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.PELOSI: Well, I look forward to welcoming you back soon again. And congratulations to you and much success.AMANPOUR: Thank you.AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to ""This Week"".GATES: Thank you.AMANPOUR: Let's start with WikiLeaks.How can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to Lady Gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing?GATES: It's -- it's an -- it's an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the U.S., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it. But one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission.So -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible. And so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in Afghanistan or Iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the U.S.AMANPOUR: So do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases?GATES: I think we have to look at it, although I must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that. I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have.And so we're going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information.AMANPOUR: How angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it?GATES: Well, I'm not sure anger is the right word. I just -- I think mortified, appalled. And -- and if -- if I'm angry, it is -- it is because I believe that this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk. It puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents. And so I think that's what puts our soldiers at risk.And -- and then, as I say, our sources. And, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct. And -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it.AMANPOUR: You know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a Taliban spokesman has told a British news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people.Are you worried?I mean Admiral Mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands?GATES: Well, I mean given the Taliban's statement, I think it -- it basically proves the point. And my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability. One is legal culpability. And that's up to the Justice Department and others. That's not my arena. But there's also a moral culpability. And that's where I think the verdict is guilty on WikiLeaks. They have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences.AMANPOUR: So let me ask you about a couple of things that came out. One is the possibility that the Taliban may have Stinger missiles.Do they, do you think?GATES: I don't think so.AMANPOUR: At all?GATES: I don't think so.AMANPOUR: The other is about Pakistan. Again raising the notion that Pakistan, no matter how much you say they're, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the Taliban and against al Qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in Pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the Taliban and what they're doing in Afghanistan.How much of a problem is that for you?GATES: Well, it -- it is a concern, there's no question about it. But -- but I would say that, again, we walked out on Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag. And -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again. And I believe that's the reason there's a certain hedge.But what I see is a change in the strategic calculus in Pakistan. As they see these groups attacking Pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in Northwestern Pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are.AMANPOUR: Right. But they're basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them. They haven't gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, Northern Waziristan. And General Jones, the national security adviser, has told ""The Washington Post"" that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate.So unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in Afghanistan?GATES: Well, I think we can but --AMANPOUR: Even if the safe havens --GATES: -- but we clearly --AMANPOUR: -- exist?GATES: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens. But they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in South Waziristan and Swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed the Pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily.And so the Pakistanis going after any of these groups, I believe, overall, helps us in what we're trying to accomplish, both with respect to Afghanistan and with respect to al Qaeda.AMANPOUR: But given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the Taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the Pakistanis to -- to move on into Northern Waziristan?GATES: I think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the Pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border. We are increasing our forces in Eastern Afghanistan that will help us do this. So I think that -- I think we're moving in the right direction here.AMANPOUR: But you don't have an open-ended period of time. The president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition. And many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know.The Taliban is clearly running out the clock -- it's trying to run out the clock.Let me put something up that David Kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to General Petraeus, said about the timetable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID KILCULLEN: They believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. And they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the Americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then. What are you doing on the 19th month? Who are you backing? Because we'll still be there and they won't be.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: So that question is out there. So many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011.But my question to you is this, what can General Petraeus do to defeat the Taliban at their own game?What can he do now in Afghanistan to avoid this deadline that they're setting for themselves?GATES: Well, first of all, I think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. We are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground. The president has been very clear about that. And if the Taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, I welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops. So I think that --AMANPOUR: But what is a lot of troops?GATES: Well, first of all, I think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers. And as we are successful, we'll probably accelerate. But, again, it's -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground.AMANPOUR: Is there any way now -- between now and December, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that you're serious and to change the dynamic? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we're already seeing that. We're already seeing it in Central Helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning. We are seeing it in places like Nad Ali. We're actually seeing it in places like Marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but it's getting better every day. And we're seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around Kandahar. It's going to take some time. It's going to be tough. We're going to take casualties. We have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us. But I think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working. But the key thing to remember is the full surge isn't even all I Afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of August. So this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect. AMANPOUR: What I think a lot of people maybe don't get is that the Afghan people still want the American forces there. In the latest ABC poll, it shows that 68 percent of the Afghan people actually want the American forces still there.Do you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the American people more about -- about Afghanistan, about the strategy, about why it's important?GATES: Well, first of all, I'm here. And I think the president has been out and has spoken about this. He talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated General Petraeus, about where we were headed.Probably we can do more. But Secretary Clinton and I and the president and the vice president and General Jones have all been out and -- and talking about this. And -- and I think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that I find frustrating is that I think that the president's strategy is really quite clear. I hear -- I hear all the stories that say what's the strategy, what's the goal here?I think it's quite clear. It's to -- it's to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time we're building up the Afghan security forces, so that the Afghan security forces can deny the Taliban and al Qaeda a base from which to attack the United States and the West.AMANPOUR: All right.GATES: It's pretty straightforward.AMANPOUR: OK. Then let me -- since you brought that up, I want to bring up what Vice President Biden told NBC earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, I think the American people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now?Let me put that up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in Afghanistan for one express purpose -- al Qaeda. The threat to the United States -- al Qaeda that exists in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not there to nation-build.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Is that it?GATES: That's good.AMANPOUR: Is that the war?GATES: I agree with that. We are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in Afghanistan. What we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective.We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in Afghanistan.But doing things to improve governance, to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the Afghan government in the security arena, that's what we're going to do.AMANPOUR: A final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the Taliban?GATES: I think that the -- I think that the way out is to improve the security situation in Afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government -- detaching themselves from al Qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the Afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons. I think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here. But it must take place on the terms of the Afghan government.AMANPOUR: And you think that can happen in -- in a year?GATES: Well, we're not limited to a year. I think that it can happen in the time frame that we're looking at ahead. Again, July 2011 is not the end. It is the beginning of a transition.AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you so much for joining us.GATES: Thanks a lot.AMANPOUR: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): Wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, has published 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak in history.GIBBS: There are names. There are operations. There's logistics. It poses a very real and potential threat.(UNKNOWN): I'm a combative person, so I wanted (inaudible)MULLEN: The truth is, they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Highlights from the Wikileaks story that's really shaken up Washington and capitals around the world. We'll talk about that and more on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, and in Madrid this morning, Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani journalist who is the world authority on the Taliban.Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me go to you first, George. What about this leak? How bad is it for the war effort? And how bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it does with state secrets?WILL: Well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in the sense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sources themselves. Not helping, in the sense that they're not a bit like the Pentagon Papers, which showed in the Vietnam War that the government internally had a very different understanding of what was going on in Vietnam than it was saying publicly.That's not the case here. These are redundant anecdotes about what we all knew from good journalism and honest government about this.What we're left with now is still the question of the mission. In your interview with Secretary Gates, he said the following: ""We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan."" Notice the preposition. We weren't attacked by Afghanistan, in the sense that we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor. We were attacked from there.And National Security Adviser James Jones has said that we have to be there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plot and train.AMANPOUR: Exactly.WILL: We were attacked from Hamburg, in a sense. You can plot in this kind of war anywhere.AMANPOUR: Well, yes, but the real ground war is in Afghanistan.And let me go to Ahmed Rashid, who is the authority on the Taliban. Ahmed, what is your assessment of how Wikileaks and all the material and information that came out of that could affect the war?RASHID: Well, again, I don't think that there has been any really major new information given in these Wikileaks. The impact has been quite extraordinary in America, in Europe, and other places simply because this war has not really been properly followed by the public.The media has not followed it. And as a result, I think people are being quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that have come out. But I don't think anything drastically new has come out. Now there is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the Taliban are going to follow up on.AMANPOUR: Precisely. And I wanted to ask you about that. You know already they have said that they're going to be searching and scouring this treasure trove. Do you -- do you foresee that there are going to be bodies turning up in Afghanistan amongst people who've really been helping the United States?RASHID: Well, I hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaks are quite old, and people have moved on. A lot of the names may be false names. I hope we're not going to see bodies, but certainly this is something -- the Taliban are extremely good at following debates in the West, the Western media, debates in parliaments in Europe, in the Congress. They will have seen this new vote just now, where so many of the Democrats seem to be voting against the war.They are expert now at following up. And if there are people to be followed up upon, they will do so.AMANPOUR: Well, let me put that to Donna Brazile and to Paul Krugman. The idea that they are really smart, they read the Western press, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to think that or not, media operation.BRAZILE: Well, it put the Afghanistan war back on the front page, the longest war in United States' history. Voters are weary of this war right now. Congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy.I think this will give the administration an opportunity to once again talk about the mission, before December, when the president has announced that he intends to reassess what they're doing.I also think it raises a serious question about Pakistan's involvement with the Taliban and also whether or not Mr. Karzai is still up to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing the police and the army. It raises a serious question about going forward and the timetable.KRUGMAN: You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, we can't abandon Afghanistan, all that. I'm surprised that people aren't pointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead.And now you're asking us to -- you're asking Obama to recover from a situation where we've spent eight years losing credibility.AMANPOUR: But the thing is, he is trying to recover. He's had this big strategy. He's made a surge in Afghanistan. And right now, for instance, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard has written a memo to President Obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011 deadline. What do you think has to happen to make this war winnable for the United States?WILL: Well, first of all, in his remarks to you, Secretary Gates semi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in July '11 -- 2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal. That's making it a fairly elastic deadline.But look what -- and our friend in Madrid can comment on this. Secretary Gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government. Now, that, A, sounds like surrender, and, B, the normal Afghan would say, ""Give me a third choice, because I don't like the Afghan government, either.""AMANPOUR: Right. Ahmed Rashid, how did you read that, that the Taliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on the terms of the Karzai government?RASHID: Well, I think this is going to be the very big debate that takes place within the Obama administration come December, when the policy review takes place, because the other position to this is that, in fact, the U.S. should start talks with the Taliban as soon as possible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try and bring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks.The Taliban, with all their interlocutors that they've been talking to so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the Americans directly. Now, any such talks can't be based on conditions set by America, as Gates has just done. They would have to be free and open talks, and they would have to continue for some time.So I think once you have a dialogue going with the Taliban, then you, I think, can go to the Pakistanis and the ISI and tell them, ""Now, look, we're talking to the Taliban. This is the end game now. The surges will continue. Talks will continue. But you now have to give a deadline for the end of these safe havens for the Taliban leaders.""In other words, the Taliban leaders should know that their safe havens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will also have a limited timeframe.AMANPOUR: Well, lots and lots to talk about on this particular issue, but let's move on a little bit. I actually asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote in the House, and whether she thought that the president needed to come out and speak more to the country about Afghanistan. This is what she said to me. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: They're worried about their economic security, and that's what they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase -- create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: So there you have it. Economic security, obviously, is the number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there is these huge problems of unemployment. There is a huge debate right now, all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effect stimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy. Is it deficit reduction austerity? Is it more stimulus? Where do we go and what does it mean to people?KRUGMAN: Well, what it means to people, I think, is a lot of confusion, which is -- which is a problem, right? They're not hearing any clear message.You know, the way I look at it is that there are two sides in this debate -- I call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were -- one side, the inflationistas, have said, ""Oh, god, we have this -- we have budget deficits. The Fed is printing money. We're going to have inflation. Interest rates are going to go sky-high.""The deflationistas have said, you know, that we've had a major financial crisis. In the fact of that, the Obama stimulus plan is too small, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants to spend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation.So far, the deflationistas have been totally right. What's interesting is that the political debate is being dominated by the people who've been wrong about everything up to this point, who said, well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower. They just hit a -- more than a year low just now.But they keep on saying, oh, but it's any day now. We've got to be afraid of those people who aren't visible in the markets and so on.But this is a -- there is this problem that people have got this austerity notion in their mind, not based on anything that's actually happening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because it appeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to make people suffer even more.AMANPOUR: Let me put up this graphic, talking about the gross domestic product of the second quarter. Growth is happening, but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.You're shaking your head.WILL: Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it. It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons.First of all, the stimulus is running out. Paul's right about this. Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone.Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent.So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift.KRUGMAN: Exactly.WILL: It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue.BRAZILE: Well, I'm not the resident economist on the panel, clearly, but what's happening, Christiane, is that we're not creating jobs. The economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs. Unemployment remains high. The Democrats will have to campaign on the promise that the policies that they've put forward thus far has averted the Great Depression 2.0.And going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past, going back to Bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economic growth, which brings us back to the Bush tax cuts and -- and whether or not the -- the Congress will -- will just let them expire in January or let some of them stay on the table.AMANPOUR: Well, you heard what I asked Speaker Pelosi, and she said she hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before the midterms. Is that likely?BRAZILE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, look, Congress on the House side, they're away for six weeks. They're going out. They're going to campaign on what they've accomplished.But I think when they return, they're going to have to turn back toward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince the voters out there that they've done something to provide economic growth for the future.KRUGMAN: Just wanted to say, George, it's exactly what I would have done in describing it. The forces for growth are fading out. We're not looking good going forward. This is very difficult. It's very hard for an administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, ""It could have been worse,"" and that is essentially -- and it's true. It actually could have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesn't sell very well.AMANPOUR: Can I...WILL: Lest it be thought that Paul and I agree on something, let me...AMANPOUR: Well, you might. Maybe this is a rarity today.WILL: No, this is not the case, because Paul thinks the government is dangerously frugal at this point, and I do not think so. I side with people like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard who say there is time for austerity, and this is it.KRUGMAN: Well, you know, we can...AMANPOUR: That's happening in Europe, as you know...(CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: That's -- yes, I think Ken Rogoff is doing some damage here with some pretty bad statistics. But...AMANPOUR: Can I -- can I move over to Madrid again and ask Ahmed about this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts what's happening in -- in America's foreign policy, as well. What do people in Pakistan, who've been promised so much aid by the United States -- does this even figure in their debates when they look at the U.S., the fact that the money is shorter?RASHID: Oh, it does very much. I mean, I think really people are fully aware that the continuation of the American presence in Afghanistan and the aid to Pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if you like, to whether the American economy picks up or not, especially in the autumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will be completed, a very critical moment will appear when Obama has to decide what his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policy review.And all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effective or uneffective the American economy is doing. I mean, we've seen the vote in Congress now. I mean, what happens in three months' time if the vote in Congress is even more lopsided and more Democrats turn against the war?AMANPOUR: That is indeed a big question. Let us move on, though, right now -- and I want to move on to something else that the Democrats made a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have an ethical Congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many people said. This is what President Obama said just in the last couple of days over the travails of Representative Charlie Rangel.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 years old. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity, and my hope is, is that happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRAZILE: It would be politically expedient for Mr. Rangel to just step down and resign, but he's not the kind of lawmaker that would do that. These are serious allegations, and Mr. Rangel would like to have his day up on the Hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answer to some of these charges.Again, it's easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of Drano, but it's clogged up, and I think Mr. Rangel and others would like to have their day to clear their names.AMANPOUR: What about the president making that pretty...KRUGMAN: Yes, well, they...AMANPOUR: ... dismissive statement?KRUGMAN: No, I think it's fair enough. But, you know, let me ask -- there's something I don't understand about this whole thing. There are actually two major investigations of members of Congress underway right now. There's Charlie Rangel, who's accused of some fairly petty, although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and there's Senator John Ensign, who's facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- it's even a story that involves sex. And you get no publicity whatsoever on the Ensign investigation.Why is Rangel getting all this attention?AMANPOUR: Is that fair, George?WILL: Well, Rangel is much more important, because he's chairman of an important committee. And in fact, Rangel's misfortune is a national misfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficit commission reports in December, we might have had -- serious tax reform in this country. That requires a cooperative member leading that committee in the House.(CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: Nothing's -- nothing's going to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)KRUGMAN: If there's actually anything to come out of the deficit commission, it would matter, but it's not.WILL: ... as Rostenkowski was with Ronald Reagan's tax reform. Now, Rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strong position. His strong position is the president and everyone wants this thing over with so the Democrats won't be tarred with this, and therefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, a reprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here.KRUGMAN: In a way, he's sort of the Hamid Karzai of the U.S. Congress.AMANPOUR: Well, I was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, but I was going to ask Ahmed Rashid what they make of all of this, given so much corruption charges over there. Ahmed, we're out of time, but thank you all so much for joining us.And the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks.

"Jamie Foxx walked away from a live interview during a celebrity basketball game when the presenter asked him about Katie Holmes.  Reports that the pair were dating emerged in 2013, but the couple only went public in September last year. Holmes divorced ex-husband Tom Cruise in June 2012.  Foxx was taking part in the ""NBA All-Star Celebrity Game"" on 16 February when host Michael Smith brought up photos of Holmes playing basketball on Valentine’s Day, during a live broadcast.  “I know you’ve prepared and I saw pictures,” Smith says in the interview. “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day? Like some real ‘Love and Basketball’?”  Foxx can be seen smiling as he takes his headphones and mic off and walks away. An assistant unclips the equipment and throws some side-eye at the camera.  “Uh oh, did we lose him?” Smith asks, as the camera shows Foxx warming up on the court. “Oh, he ready to go, he ready to hoop.”  Also taking part in the game were Justin Bieber, Black Panther star Michael B Jordan, Stranger Things actor Caleb McLaughlin, Black-ish stars Anthony Anderson and Miles Brown, and Olympic sprinter Andre de Grasse.

"Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  ""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""  She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f--- Kanye up.”  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up."" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  ""Kim hopes people won’t hold Kanye’s actions against her,"" says the source, ""but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems."" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye’s out of town. ""It’s way less stressful,"" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he’s working. ""She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she’s doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye’s opinions are NOT hers.""  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her — and she’s got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have ""a third failed marriage under her belt,"" says the insider, ""there’s no coming back from Kanye’s latest meltdown. It’s time for Kim to not only distance herself from Kanye, but to make it offcial and divorce him.""  For more on this, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on stands now!

"Ever since his breakup with Anna Faris last summer, many have been wondering who the next woman in Chris Pratt’s life is going to be. The guy is hot as hell, not to mention he could make you laugh in under a minute. He’s one of the most eligible bachelors out there and we are dying to know who he’s going to date next. It’s been a year since his separation with Faris and it doesn’t seem like those two are rekindling things anytime soon.  He was recently seen out for a coffee with a “mystery blonde,” and the rumor mills are going about who she can be. Pratt has had many blondes in his life so it could be anyone. Whether he’s meeting a friend for coffee or if it’s something more, the gossips are out circling like wolves. Could Pratt be taking himself off the market? He doesn’t have a whole lot of time to date these days, now that he became an Avenger, he’s going to be busier than ever. Avengers: Infinity War is coming out in April and that is sure to keep him busy while he’s on the movie tour. Two months after that, we will see the much-anticipated Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. With two summer hits coming his way, he'll probably reach a whole new level of fame. Does he have time for his new mystery blonde? Let’s check out 15 celebs Chris Pratt should date instead of the “mystery blonde.”  advertising  15 Pratt Should Take On The Black Widow  Scarlett Johansson is one of the most eligible females in the industry right now and one of the foxiest women in Hollywood. How hot would it be if these two started dating? Now that Pratt has instated himself in the Avengers, he’s on a whole new level and could certainly score a date with this beauty.  There was certainly a time that he would not have been considered in the same league as Johansson. However, she just got divorced again, so she may be looking for some fresh meat.  She is the Black Widow after all. She doesn’t have the best track record for relationships whereas Pratt really has only had two major relationships since he's been in Hollywood and one was his marriage to Faris. But the two would definitely steam up things in Hollywood together for sure.  14 Haley Bennett Is More Than Magnificent  advertising  Haley Bennett is certainly one blonde who is cute as a button. She would make a great addition to Pratt’s life.  He does have a history of liking petite blondes, so she would fit right in.  The two were costars together for the movie The Magnificent Seven. Pratt was definitely impressed with his costar when they were shooting the movie because she could handle a rifle better than anyone else on set. She did have one mishap though: ""My bullets flew up and fell into my cleavage,"" she said. ""They burn you. You could just smell the flesh burning,"" Bennett said. ""When I was riding the horses, I would get chaffing. We had mosquito bites and my hands were raw from the reigns and my legs were raw from the stirrups because I was wearing a dress."" Maybe working together wasn’t that hot.  13 Love On The Set Of Jurassic World  Bryce Howard was another gorgeous celebrity that had rumor mills booming when he split from Anna Faris. The two worked together on Jurassic World and became super close. Howard cried when filming ended and the two were recently reunited for the making of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Howard is (un)fortunately happily married and has been since 2006, so we’re not likely to see her with Pratt anytime soon. She does tend to stalk the men that she’s interested in, or at least that’s how she got her husband.  “I had an enormous crush on him — he was gorgeous, and it was love at first sight, but not for him.  I basically stalked him, there was no interest, and then I called him at a really inappropriate hour in the middle of the night and asked him out for coffee.”  12 Jennifer Lawrence Is His Best Female Friend  advertising  Anytime that there is news about Chris Pratt with a blonde, we have to automatically check to see if it’s Jennifer Lawrence. We’ve all been dying to know if the rumors of a fling between them were really true. Of course, when Pratt and Faris first split, all eyes were on Lawrence because let’s be honest, when Pratt and Lawrence were in the movie Passengers together, their Instagram posts were insane.  The pictures alone, never mind their intense chemistry, would have had most wives filing for a divorce. You can’t fake chemistry like that.  Of course, we all assumed the two would come out and make things official just like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt eventually did. Alas, we are still waiting, but we feel that she is still in the running to be the next blonde in his life.  11 Aubrey Plaza Could Give Pratt A Run For His Money  Before Chris Pratt got insanely hot, he was on the TV show Parks and Recreation with Aubrey Plaza. She played his girlfriend on the show and the two had the natural chemistry of two people who just get each other. Pratt obviously cares about his costar and considers her a friend because he went to see his former costar at the premiere of her movie release, Ingrid Goes West, last year. The two would certainly make a cute couple and they have a lot of history together, so we wouldn't be surprised if they dated.  She was there before he got ripped, so he would know that she would still stick by him if he decided to give up the abs.  The two have a great sense of humor, so that’s an easy match right there.  10 Chris Pratt And The Foxy Olivia Munn  advertising  Recently, Chris Pratt and Olivia Munn were linked together and the two would definitely make a smoking hot couple. Many believe there was some weird love triangle going on between Anna Faris, Pratt, and Munn. There were rumors going around that Munn and Pratt were “secretly dating” and we’re all for that. Many believed that Faris would have been angry about the union because Faris had once told Munn how much she loved Pratt. Munn crushed all our hopes when she made this Instagram story about how she and Pratt were not dating.  ""Hello! 1. Not every woman is scorned and upset after a breakup. 2. Not every woman is ""furious"" at another woman for dating her ex.  3. So even if I was dating @prattprattpratt, some tabloids got me and @annafaris all wrong. 4. Women respect and love each other a lot more than some people like to think. 5. Chris and I would have a horrible celebrity name."" We still think they would be good together.  9 Anna Kendrick Would Make A Cute Girlfriend  Let’s be honest, Chris Pratt loves petite girls that can make him laugh and Anna Kendrick totally fits that category. They would be adorable together.  Kendrick is a little spitfire who would never let Pratt get the last word in and according to Ryan Reynolds, she’s a heck of a kisser, so that’s one extra point for her.  Kendrick also happens to know Aubrey Plaza really well, so maybe Plaza should set it all up if she’s not going to sweep Pratt off his feet. We all know that Pratt should be with a funny girl, that’s just his taste. He was with Faris for a long time and we bet it lasted that long because they could laugh away their problems for a long time.  advertising  8 Emily Vancamp Is A Blast From His Past  advertising  Emily Vancamp and Chris Pratt dated a long time ago before he was famous. Pratt has only had two major relationships while in Hollywood and one of them was with Faris while the other was Vancamp. The two actually played brother and sister on the TV show Everwood which is actually kind of weird since the two were dating at the time.  ""Yeah, we've pretty much gotten used to the response of, 'Ew, that's weird. That's creepy,'"" Pratt said of their relationship in an interview with TV Guide in 2006.  ""The people who know us are happy, and probably expected it to happen eventually. But yeah, every once in a while, we get that one person that's like, 'That's really creepy. You just kissed your sister.'"" The two dated for three years before they broke up.  7 Sarah Hyland Would Be A Great Match  Why didn’t we think of this one before? It’s perfect! Sarah Hyland is a total babe and she would definitely be Chris Pratt’s type of girl. If you have ever checked out her Instagram page, then you know that she can be silly, geeky, funny, and foxy all rolled into one. Some of her pics are very original. She also knows comedy since she's been on the TV show Modern Family. She would be the perfect girl to help Pratt move on from Anna Faris and also forget this new “mystery blonde.” However, since November of last year, Hyland has been linked with Wells Adams, so Pratt may have just missed his chance.  6 Karen Gillan And Pratt Are Promoting Movies Together  advertising  Karen Gillan and Chris Pratt have been in not one, but three movies together. It’s kismet, we swear. Gillan and Pratt first met on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy. Gillian returned for the sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and was reunited with Pratt once again in the new Avengers: Infinity War as well. She will also be starring in the next Avengers movie for 2019. That’s a lot of screen time for the both of them. She’s definitely cute and that seems to be the theme of all the girls he is connected with. Plus, they wouldn’t have to worry about being separated for long periods of time for filming. They seem to do a lot of movies together. We think they would make a great match.  5 Elizabeth Olsen Is Totally A Badass  Elizabeth Olsen plays a lot of badass characters, especially in the Avengers movies. The little sister to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen has paved her own way in Hollywood and Pratt would certainly make a good match for her. Pratt knows what it’s like to play badass characters since he’s been doing it in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. These two would have met on the set of the new movie Avengers: Infinity War and we think they would be hot together. She’s clearly a beautiful woman and already has a successful career in Hollywood, so there should be no jealousy between them when it comes to their careers. Sorry, Anna Faris! There are a few costars that Pratt has been connected with that would make great partners for him. Only problem is, it looks like she's kind of friends with Faris since they worked together.  4 The Emma Stone Connection  advertising  Maybe Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are just friends. Sure, why not — those pictures could have been just two buddies just enjoying time alone together. In that case, Lawrence should be helping her best friend Emma Stone out and hooking her up with an amazing guy. We all know that deep down Pratt is a great guy. And did we mention that he has abs? The fact that Lawrence and Stone get along so well because they're weird, it would make her a shoo-in for Pratt.  Stone is hilarious on and off camera, so she would make a perfect girlfriend for Pratt because he likes a girl with a sense of humor.  The two are both currently single, so Lawrence should make the effort and set them up. Unless there’s something holding her back…  3 Elizabeth Debicki Is A Foxy Costar  Elizabeth Debicki is another actress that has been part of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. She worked with Chris Pratt on the first two movies.  Elizabeth Debicki is without a doubt a complete fox and she could give Pratt a run for his money. He better snatch her up because she gets too famous for him.  She is not as well known in the industry as he is, but neither was Anna Faris. Debicki is certainly doing a good job of paving her way in the biz. She was also in The Great Gatsby with Leonardo DiCaprio and she has four movies coming out in 2018, so that’s pretty impressive. She would definitely be a partner that Pratt could stand beside proudly.  2 Emma Watson Is A Force To Be Reckoned With  advertising  Emma Watson would be an amazing partner for Chris Pratt for one reason — she’s a powerful woman in the industry. She’s been in it for a while now thanks to the Harry Potter movies, so she knows how to deal with fame. She also knows how to speak her mind so she can handle paparazzi with the best of them. She’s someone that could handle a powerhouse boyfriend like Pratt and support him right back. She’s a gorgeous actress who is making her way in Hollywood now that she’s no longer a kid anymore. They would be adorable together because we know that Pratt deserves the best when it comes to a girlfriend. Whoever the “mystery blonde” is, we think that Pratt should definitely check out our list before he makes any final decisions.  1 A Rekindling Affair With Anna Faris  Sure, why not? It would be great news all around if Chris Pratt were to reunite with his ex-wife. There are so many reasons why the two should try to make it work. They are awesome together, they are each other’s number-one fan, and they have a cute little boy together. A girl can dream, right?  There was a rumor that Chris Pratt and Anna Faris would get back together.  After all, for the longest time, they were #relationshipgoals. Keep that in mind Blake Lively. You never can tell sometimes what celebrity couples are going to call it quits because we definitely didn’t see this one coming. It’s obvious these two are unlikely to get back together, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some pretty great options out there for him.  advertising  Give TheRichest a Thumbs up!"	1

President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN’s Chris Cuomo looks like a “chained lunatic” on television. CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting” and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a “no-talent guy” who talks “filthy.”  Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.  “I’ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I’ve been able not to watch or read things that aren’t pleasant,” he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. “And it keeps you young.”  There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.  “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really dishonest,” he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. “You people are quite dishonest in all fairness.” He said he used to watch MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.  The one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.  Spokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president’s criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, “His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.” Trump’s claims about CNN’s Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  Here’s an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:  For instance I don’t watch CNN. I don’t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don’t do interviews and stuff and want to … He went the other way. Which is fine. He’s got some problems. But I don’t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don’t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I’m watching Fox. But they’re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don’t mean they – if I do something wrong. But it’s really, honestly it’s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he’s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He’s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who’s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it’s like – sometimes they’ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they’ll start screaming, we’re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I’ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They’re all doing well because of me. But it’s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It’s just bad. It’s an ability I never thought I’d have. I never thought I’d have the ability to say, they’re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won’t watch it. And it’s amazing, it doesn’t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They’re really dishonest. I mean they’re really dishonest.  Trump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert’s blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:	1
"For Suri Cruise, seeing Dad has been a mission impossible. Multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that Tom Cruise has had essentially ""no contact"" with the 10-year-old daughter he shares with ex-wife Katie Holmes.  ""Tom hasn't seen or even called Suri in about three years,"" claims a family source. Alleges another insider, ""Tom has no relationship with Suri.""  In fact, the last time Cruise, 54, and his youngest daughter were photographed publicly was in August 2012, when he took her to Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Cruise has two older children, Connor, 21, and Isabella, 23, with his second ex-wife, Nicole Kidman.)  Holmes, 37, and Cruise, a devout Scientologist, began dating in the spring of 2005 and announced their engagement that June. They welcomed Suri the following April, and tied the knot in front of more than 150 guests at a lavish wedding at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, on November 18, 2006.  Six years later, in June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce. At the time, an insider told Us Holmes didn't want her daughter raised in Scientology and homeschooled by church teachers: ""She wanted Suri to go to a normal school with regular kids."" In the years since, NYC-based Holmes and Suri have since been “excommunicated” from Cruise's life because of his religion, according to the family source. (The insider adds that Cruise ""still sees"" Connor and Isabella, who are both church members.)  Many ex-Scientologists have claimed leaders force members to shun anyone who leaves the church. But a rep for the Church of Scientology tells Us, ""We never comment on individual parishioners' lives. On the issue of Church religious practices, we do not know who your anonymous sources are, but they got it all wrong. The answer to your question is no. Scientologists respect the faith of others, associate with and befriend members of every religion. Scientologists do not cut ties with non-Scientologist friends or family members because they have chosen another religion. Given that Scientology is a new religion, Scientologists often have family members and friends who are not Scientologists and who may practice another faith or no faith at all. This causes no conflict for Scientologists.""  Cruise’s rep had no comment.

Don’t worry, Teen Mom 2 fans, there will still be plenty of Jenelle Evans, despite what she may claim to want. During last week’s episode of the MTV reality series, the 26-year-old North Carolina native threatened to quit the show because her husband, David Eason, had been fired.  Jenelle has stayed mostly quiet on social media about her recent drama, but over the weekend, she clarified that she will be back on Teen Mom 2, whether she wants to be or not.  “Have lots of offers from many different people, but you have to turn them down when you’re locked in a contract. #Annoying,” she tweeted on Sunday.  Have lots of offers from many different people, but you have to turn them down when you’re locked in a contract. 😑🙄 #Annoying — Jenelle Eason (@PBandJenelley_1) August 5, 2018  She told one fan that she was “just clarifying rumors” and added to another that she’s “still butting heads” with the show.  On Monday, she retweeted the news that she is skipping the main reunion taping and instead filming her own segment separately. Jenelle was very vocal about her frustrations with this season of the show after David was fired for his insensitive tweets about the LGBT community earlier this year.  “I will go do my own thing and I will get out of my contract,” she told producers during last week’s episode. “Best believe, mark my f**king words. I’m not doing it. I’ll go do my own thing. I have people offering me stuff for Netflix and Amazon right f**king now.”  Jenelle has faced her fair share of controversy this season. In a recent episode, she was involved in a road rage incident in which she allegedly pulled a gun on a man after following him to his house. Jenelle denied the claims, though her 9-year-old son, Jace, who was in the car at the time, told her mother and his legal guardian, Barbara, that Jenelle did pull out the gun.  Following the incident, Barabara was seen talking to Nathan Griffith, Jenelle’s ex and the father of her son, Kaiser, about trying to get custody of all of her daughter's children.  Here's more on the drama:  RELATED CONTENT:	0
"The estate of Tony winner Jonathan Larson will exec produce the live musical of the HIV/AIDS-themed play. Marc Platt is also on board.  Fox has found its follow-up to Grease Live.  Following prolonged negotiations, Jonathan Larson's Tony-winning HIV/AIDS-themed musical Rent is set as the network's next live musical, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Larson's estate is on board to executive produce alongside Marc Platt (La La Land, Wicked). Rent marks Platt's latest live project for following NBC's Jesus Christ Superstar and Fox's newly announced A Christmas Story and last year's Grease. Additional auspices, as well as a premiere date and casting, will be announced later.  The rock musical, loosely based on La Boheme, tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York's East Village in the days of the Bohemian Alphabet City and under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning play was created by Larson, who died suddenly before Rent opened off-Broadway in 1996 and then moved to Broadway. Rent won Tony Awards for best musical, book of a musical and original score — all for Larson — and scored co-lead Wilson Jermaine Heredia a win for featured actor for his performance as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen drummer with HIV/AIDS.  ""Rent​​ was Jonathan’s dream of sharing the ​theater and the passion he had for it with a whole new generation,” Julie and Al Larson said in a statement. “None of us could have imagined the massive impact that the messages and themes in Rent would have on the ​theater​ community or the world ... except for Jonathan. We are absolutely thrilled to be continuing Jonathan’s legacy and ​the still-relevant ​themes of ​the show in this way.”    The original Broadway cast also included Adam Pascal, Daphne-Rubin-Vega and Idina Menzel, who all collected Tony nominations, as well as Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs.    ""We are so honored to partner with the estate of the brilliant Jonathan Larson and producer Marc Platt on one of the great musicals of our time,"" said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. ""The title is so iconic, the music is so beloved, and the themes are as meaningful today as they were when the show first premiered on Broadway. With Marc overseeing this project, we are sure it will have a profound impact on the legions of fans who know and love this musical.""  The production was adapted for the big screen in 2005 with Chris Columbus directing and produced by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan. Stephen Chbosky adapted Larson's book, with nearly all of the original Broadway cast returning to reprise their roles. With a $40 million budget, the pic grossed a disappointing $31.6 million. The play marked its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a tour.  Fox's production will be exec produced by Platt, Adam Siegel, Julie Larson, Al Larson and Revolution Studios' Vince Totino, Scott Hemming and Marla Levine. The original production was produced by the New York Theatre Workshop and on Broadway by Jeffrey Seller, Kevin McCollum, Allan S. Gordon and the NYTW. Larson, for his part, also earned a Pulitzer Prize for the production.  Speaking with THR at the Emmys, Walden said Rent ""would be a dream — a dream your biggest dream"" to land as the network's next live production. ""That would be a title that's perfect for Fox and something that we could do in a meaningful way. Our network is distinguished by cutting-edge programming and being able to take subject matter — whether it was Glee or Shots Fired — I think our brand is perfect for that title. I would love it.""  Rent, with a legion of loyal and diehard fans, has big shoes to fill. Grease Live ranked third this year at the Emmys, collecting a total of five statuettes including for outstanding special class program and directing for Tony winner Thomas Kail (Hamilton).  The news comes after Fox announced A Christmas Story would air in December, opposite NBC and Jennifer Lopez with Bye Bye Birdie. NBC also noted this week that it would tackle Jesus Christ Superstar for Easter 2018. (There remains no word on NBC's A Few Good Men live production.)  Paradigm and Carol Contes of the Guzman Law Group brokered the deal."	0
"Real Housewives of New Jersey star Caroline Manzo wants justice to be served after her sister, Dina, was brutally beaten during a home invasion this past weekend.  Even though the two had their issues in the past, Dina's sister Caroline has spoken out in support of her sibling.  ""I hope the police get to the bottom of this and whoever is responsible for this gets what's coming to them,"" Caroline said.  Dina Manzo, 46, and her millionaire boyfriend, David Cantin, were viciously beaten by two burglars upon entering their Holmdel, New Jersey, townhouse on Saturday. The couple was returning home from a celebration for Teresa Giudice’s daughter, Audriana’s first communion.  The Holmdel police report says the pair arrived home after the festivities on Saturday night and opened their front door to find two masked individuals inside the house. The robbers then rushed towards the two and struck Cantin with a baseball bat several times. Manzo was punched multiple times.

The two were able to free themselves and call the police. They were taken to the hospital for treatment with both of them suffering facial injuries.  Two days after the incident, Chris Laurita, the 47-year-old brother to Dina and Caroline, also addressed the issue.  ""[Dina] is obviously shaken by the whole thing. She's back in California now and seems to be OK,"" he said. ""It's unfortunate what happened. Hopefully they'll get to the bottom of it.""  ""Dina and David are obviously shaken up from the traumatic and violent home invasion and robbery,"" the attorney representing the couple said in a statement on Monday. ""No one should ever have to go through what they did. They are grateful to law enforcement and the other emergency responders and appreciate everyone's concern and well-wishes.""

"20 December 2018  Just when you thought the celebrations were over, Nick and Priyanka attended their second wedding reception in Mumbai on Wednesday - two weeks after they tied-the-knot at a palace in Jodhpur.  Priyanka wore a a royal blue and gold gown paired with a dazzling diamond necklace. Nick chose a slightly more casual grey suit for the occasion.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images SOPA Images  Addressing their guests, the bride said in a speech (via E!): ""It means so much to us that all of you came tonight. This has been an extremely special chapter in my life and I wanted my husband to meet all of the special people that have contributed to it. So thank you so much for being here, friends of my parents, my mom, who's hosting this wonderful evening, my dad, who I know is here.

Justin Bieber’s reputation as a party-loving house-trasher and terrible neighbor is biting him in the butt. Page Six reports that Beverly Hills landowners have banded together to reject Bieber from renting a house in the neighborhood.  An unnamed real estate agent told Page Six that Bieber “wants to rent a big estate, but many of the owners of the big Beverly Hills properties, which are for rent, have clubbed together to agree that nobody should rent to Justin.”  The Canadian pop star is better known for upsetting his neighbors with dangerous driving and random eggings than for his house-destroying parties, but whatever the reason, Beverly Hills residents really don’t want him in their ‘hood. Bieber is reportedly offering well over the asking rent—up to $100,000 a month—and still no one has rented him any of the places he’s interested in.  Cast out of the Bev Hills rental market, poor Bieber has been forced to move into an unidentified posh hotel in the neighborhood. He’s rented quarters in the hotel “for up to a year,” says Page Six.  Bieber has rented in Beverly Hills before, taking up residence in a $59,000-a-month glass house that looks a bit like a glamorous salad spinner. (It was a short-term lease.)	1

He explained to reporters at the Warriors’ Media Day, “The things that he’s said and the things that he hasn’t said at the right times… we won’t stand for it. By acting and not going, hopefully that will inspire some change when it comes to what we tolerate in this country, what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye toward.”  The tweet made “Stephen Curry” a trending topic on Twitter, and actually prompted rival LeBron James to tweet, “U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain’t going! So therefore ain’t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!” Andy Cohen replied “HAHAHAHHA AMEN,” while Chrissy Teigen laughed over the “U bum” line. Cohen also pointed out, “HOUSEWIVES PLAYBOOK: rescind invitations liberally! (See: Bethenny re LuAnn, Mexico; Bethenny & Ramona, Mexico.)” Seth Meyers also quipped about Trump, “Somebody’s got their laid back weekend vibe working!”  “Perhaps it’s not a great honor while your stench is there,” slammed John Legend. Don Cheadle sarcastically replied to Trump, “I’m sure he’s crushed.” Jeffrey Wright praised, “Well done @StephenCurry30.” Joked Trevor Noah, “‘You’re not breaking up with me, I’m breaking up with you!'” George Takei said to he president, “And just when you thought he couldn’t get any more petty…” Ava DuVernay also wrote to him, “Man, nobody with any sense or self-respect considers it an honor to be within a 10 mile radius of you. It is known.” Karrueche Tran exclaimed, “HE WAS NEVER GOING IDIOT! PUERTO RICO IS WITHOUT POWER!! PUERTO RICO IS A PART OF THE US. YOU DO KNOW THAT RIGHT?!!”  Jesse Tyler Ferguson noted, “It’s an honor when the president is honorable.” And Jemele Hill, who earned Trump’s ire on Twitter earlier this month for calling the president a white supremacist, tweeting with a laughing emoji, “Hey @StephenCurry30, welcome to the club bro.” Meanwhile, Curry’s wife, Ayesha, shared an eye-roll emoji in response to the president’s tweet, and wrote, ""Okay… Donate to earthquake relief here!!!” She included a link to UNICEF.

After being courted for several months, Leonardo DiCaprio will star in Quentin Tarantino’s untitled Charles Manson movie, sources confirmed to Variety.  DiCaprio will play an aging, out-of-work actor in the film. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, is being eyed for the role of Sharon Tate.  This will mark DiCaprio’s first film since winning the Oscar in 2016 for his performance in Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “The Revenant.” DiCaprio and Tarantino last collaborated on 2012’s “Django Unchained.”  He is repped by LBI Entertainment.  As previously reported, Tom Cruise is also being pursued to star in the director’s ninth feature. Sources now tell Variety that Tarantino is interested in casting Al Pacino in the film as well. Sony is handling distribution.  The movie will hit theaters on Aug. 9, 2019, Variety has learned. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against “Artemis Fowl,” Disney’s adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.  Sony beat out several bidders, including Warner Bros. and Paramount, for rights to the film. The movie — shrouded in secrecy — is set in 1969 and is believed to involve Charles Manson and the Manson family murders. The director has told media outlets that it’s not a biopic, but is an ensemble film set during the tumultuous time period. It’s the first pic that Tarantino is releasing without the Weinstein Company. A group of investors led by Maria Contreras-Sweet is in a strong position to buy the Weinstein Company following sexual misconduct allegations against its disgraced founder Harvey Weinstein.  Deadline Hollywood first reported the news.	0
Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones is opening up about life after his anti-bullying video, revealing that he hasn’t returned to school since the footage spread across the Internet.  The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they said they aren’t sure when Keaton will return to Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I actually haven’t been to school,” he said. He added of his bullies: “Why do you bully? What’s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.  Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video  “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”	0
Star Jones recently confirmed she’s happily engaged to her boyfriend, but RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal the former The View co-host’s ex-husband Al Reynolds has some big news of his own to share.  Jones, 55, and Chicago-based Ricardo Lugo, an Illinois assistant state’s attorney, began dating in the summer of 2016 — eight years after she and Wall Street executive Reynolds called it quits on their marriage.  Now, in a revealing tell-all exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, Reynolds confirms all those rumors that have long swirled around his sexuality, opens up about his past struggles with drugs and alcohol, and explains how he finally plans to move forward with his life. “Today,” he told Radar, “I accept myself as a bisexual man.”  Ever since I have been in the public eye, people have been speculating on my sexuality. And ‘speculating’ is a kind word for how it actually played out. With anger and disdain, people have been calling me out as gay, closeted, a sham and even nastier; much nastier.  PHOTOS: Bella Thorne Comes Out As Bisexual  I have come to a point in my life where I am ready to discuss my truth. I wasn’t ready to do this then — I wasn’t even ready to think about it, let alone process it. To understand my journey and how I got to this point, you need to understand a little about me.  I am the youngest of six children in a Southern Baptist family. We grew up in a three-bedroom mobile home in Horsepasture, Virginia. We were deeply religious; when we weren’t in church we were in school or an after-school activity. My life was filled with vacation bible school, missionary meetings, Sunday school, choir practice and youth ministry.  Life was not nuanced or frivolous, nor did it allow any time for introspection. It was clear and proscribed, black and white, angels or sinners. And people who were intimate with others of their own gender were the worst of all with no chance of redemption, or the glorious afterlife that I was taught awaited us all.  As a black man, that message and the hate and homophobia were multiplied to the nth degree. I saw no path out that would resolve my personal feelings with my deeply held and ingrained religious beliefs.  PHOTOS: Will Smith Responds To $2M ‘Gay’ Cover-Up Scandal  This internal dissonance was a powerful thing, like a cancer eating at one’s soul. This resulted in some tough times — homelessness, unemployment, dependence on drugs and alcohol, public assistance, and, at the center of it all, a deep, deep shame and a feeling of unworthiness of the love of God. I didn’t believe I deserved to live a good life, and I clearly didn’t.  My journey to the light was not a quick one nor an easy one. I threw myself into getting the best education I could, getting three degrees, and working harder than anyone else. I was a classic overachiever, suppressing the real issues of my life. I became a workaholic and have been on Wall Street, a banker, an academic and a consultant.  I was not only getting educated about business and the professional life, I was getting exposed to a far different life than I had known growing up. “I saw people from all walks of life, with multi-dimensional points of views and lifestyles I could only imagine.  Their ability to navigate the business world and have a fulfilling personal life was a revelation to me — you can have it all. So, I sought out my own happiness and the life that would fulfill me — not the life that I had been taught was my destiny.  PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Gay & Bisexual Community  Along the way there have been speed bumps and sinkholes. And at the same time, I have met presidents, kings, top athletes and great entertainers. I have hit the highest of high notes and had the lowest of moments. But I have learned gratitude for the lessons my merciful Savior has allowed me to experience and process. And I have become tougher, more empathetic, more open-minded and able to love greater, deeper and better, especially myself.  Today I accept myself as a bisexual man. I have learned that sexual orientation is not binary, at least for me. I am capable of loving both sexes, and I have done both. My relationships, all of them, have been honest and based on my attraction to the other person. When I am in love I don’t equivocate, nor do I waver.  I tell this story to both encourage my personal path, as well as give some small measure of hope to others that no matter your beginnings, no matter the obstacles, there is nothing so fulfilling and Godlike as living the life that was destined.  I will not live in fear or shame any longer. I will revel in the light of my truth and bask in the light of my Savior Jesus Christ who loves me and accepts me exactly as He created me.

Luann de Lesseps has been sued by her ex-husband and two children.  The Real Housewives of New York City star’s first husband, Alexandre de Lesseps, her daughter, Victoria de Lesseps, and son, Noel de Lesseps, have filed a lawsuit against Luann, 53, over a judgement in her divorce that they allege she didn’t follow through on.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Luann breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust “for the benefit of her two children.”  “This action arises from Defendant’s breach of a Stipulation of Settlement and related Judgment of Divorce by her failure to create a trust for the benefit of her children, her conversion of the trust’s corpus and her present threat to abscond with money derived from the potential sale of the trust corpus and use it to purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York,” the documents read.  The judgment in her divorce required Alexandre to give the deed of the former couple’s marital residence in Bridgehampton, New York, to Luann, who agreed to create a trust for her two children. Luann was also required to “fund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence,” according to the documents.  Now, Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are claiming Luann “never created” the trust and instead sold the residence in November 2014 for $8 million and used the earnings to purchase a home in Southampton, New York for $3.1 million.  According to the settlement, if the marital home was sold, “the entire net proceeds of the sale may at any time prior to the termination of the Trust, be reinvested by [Luann] to purchase another residence, provided that the children shall continue to be the owners, in Trust, of an undivided one-half interest in said property.”  But the documents allege that Luann “has never, since her purchase of the Premises, created the Trust or conveyed to her children, in Trust, an undivided one-half interest in the Premises.”  According to the documents, Luann has threatened to sell her home “for more than fifty percent its present value and leave Suffolk County with the proceeds … so that she may purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York.”  Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are seeking for Luann to abide by the judgment and to prevent her from listing or selling the home.  A rep for de Lesseps did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.	0
"Image Courtesy Universal Music GroupSam Hunt's debut album, Montevallo, is now in stores featuring his breakthrough hit ""Leave the Night On.""  The album title comes from the name of a city in Alabama about 25 minutes south of Birmingham. Sam played football at the University of Alabama at Birmingham before moving to Nashville. Once he got to Music City, Sam ended up dating a girl who lived down in Montevallo. Though that relationship is now over, that girl is the main inspiration for the songs Sam wrote and recorded for his debut project.  He tells ABC News Radio, ""I spent a lot of time talking to her about songs. I probably should have included her as a co-writer on a lot of these songs because I spent a lot of time chatting with her.""  Spending so much time with that girl made Sam tap into a vulnerable side of himself he hadn't been able to display on the football field.  ""I got a lot of insight into females in general from being in a close relationship with her,"" Sam says. ""I used a lot of that when writing on the songs, because a lot of the songs are relationship-based. I didn't want it to be just extra-macho.""  While Sam shows his sensitive side on songs like ""Break Up in a Small Town"" and ""Take Your Time,"" he also comes off as a very confident guy on other tracks such as ""House Party,"" ""Speakers"" and ""Leave the Night On.""  Sam explains, ""You know, I think there is a side of me personally that can be vulnerable, and there's also a side that can be the opposite of that.""  He adds, ""I think it takes a strength to be vulnerable, so it is a weird paradox there that I think sort of happens on the album.""  Look for Sam to perform a song from Montevallo on ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday and Live with Kelly & Michael on Thursday.  Follow @ABCNewsRadio  Copyright 2014 ABC News Radio"	0

The ‘I Kissed a Girl’ singer is currently promoting her new single which is called Bon Appetite with this veggie-infuse photo.  Together this funny picture the 32-year-old wrote “late night snack.”  late night snack ??? #bonappetit [email protected] A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on May 27, 2017 at 6:25pm PDT  It has been quite a busy week full of ups and down for the pop star as she appeared on the season finale of Saturday Night Live in NYC, and she had some amazing performances.  Last Thursday night she also played an intimate show at London’s Water Rats club, in which she referred to the horrible bombing in Manchester that took place earlier during the week.  ABS News reported that at the end of the singer’s 20-minute set, a set that was streamed live on Twitter, she addressed the tragic event.  “It was hard. It was hard for you guys, it was hard for me because we all love music,” Perry told the concert goer.  “And you think about it, and you think that’s my friend, that’s my sister, that’s my brother, that’s the person that loves music, you know.

She confessed that she is currently much more grounded than she was before.	0
ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1
Taylor Swift‘s music video director Joseph Kahn is doubling down on his defenses of the singer and himself following the release of her buzzy and seemingly revenge-themed “Look What You Made Me Do” music video.  While Kahn earlier called out what he saw as a gendered double standard following critiques of Swift and himself after the video’s release, this time he’s calling out Beyoncé, showing apparently no fear of her avid fan base, the Bey Hive.  In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kahn addressed online critics that he’s been sparring with many on Twitter who found visual similarities between “Look What You Made Me Do” and Beyoncé’s groundbreaking “Formation” video.  “It’s not ‘Formation’ at all,” Kahn said. “They try to say she’s wearing a black crop top and Beyoncé wore a black crop top. But they don’t realize in 2015 in ‘Bad Blood,’ Taylor Swift was wearing a black crop top. I really do think, by the way, that Beyoncé copied ‘Bad Blood.’”  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  It’s a bold statement from a man who’s already felt the fire of the Lemonade singer’s fans, but Kahn is no stranger to controversy when it comes to his collaborations with Swift.  He came to Swift’s defense in a statement in 2015, explaining his creative vision with Swift after the “Wildest Dreams” video was widely criticized for glamorizing African colonialism.

Ruler Elizabeth Says: “Muslim Refugees Are Dividing Nationality, I Fully Agree With Donald Trump We Should Deport Them To Avoid Bloody Terrorist Attacks.” Do you Agree Her?This end of the week the BBC is communicating a journalistic irregularity: A full, sit-down discussion with Queen Elizabeth II.The venture, a review on her royal celebration function in 1953, was 22 years really taking shape, and a media overthrow given the Queen’s memorable hesitance to connect specifically with the press in any capacity.Her Majesty has allowed off camera access to imperial life previously.

Be that as it may, “The Coronation,” which affectation on BBC1 at 8 p.m. on Sunday, will be one of her initially broadcast trades with a columnist.It likewise demonstrates her connecting with different crowns engaged with the service, and giving a distinctive portrayal of the experience of being introduced as leader of gigantic swathes of the world (when she took the honored position expansive parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean were as yet British settlements).	1
"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you."""	1
Laura Dern in a still from Twin Peaks. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME  A few steps in to “Part Six”, we’re finally given some sweet relief. Not only is a cliffhanger from “Part Four” resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von’s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch’s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of “Part Four”, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper’s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, “No, but I know where she drinks,” which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper’s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let’s back up a bit, because there’s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we’ll certainly touch upon..  “Part Six” opens where “Part Five” closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer’s badge as if he’s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it’s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband’s full name — “That’s my husband, Dougie Jones” — is a bit odd, but the officers don’t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he’s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie.    It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny.  Following this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who’s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he’s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, “You have to wake up! You have to wake up!” and then, after a beat, he insists: “Don’t die! Don’t die!” The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper’s evil doppelgänger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he’s doing this, pin points of green laser light — yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore’s character in “Part Five” — appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it’s guiding what he’s doing.  Now, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von’s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. (By the way, I’ll now take a few personal liberties in saying that I really wish other recaps of this new season would stop referring to the Roadhouse as the Bang Bang Bar. Have you ever heard a character from the show refer to it as such? No. Then you shouldn’t either.) As previously discussed, it’s Diane, sitting with her back to the camera for maximum effect, with a flapper-esque white blonde bob that slowly turns to greet Albert after he says her name. Everything about this is perfect and it will be very interesting to see what happens when they get her in front of Evil Cooper.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch that is Twin Peaks, Richard Horne (Eamon Farren) is doing drug business with Red (Balthazar Getty) in an empty warehouse riddled with bullet holes. The character Red is one of many seemingly obvious tributes to Dennis Hopper’s Frank Booth from Blue Velvet and his mix of humor and malevolence is very effective. “Have you ever studied your hand,” Red asks Richard while twitching around and performing a series of Elvis-like karate moves. He flips a dime into the air that seems to spin there forever before impossibly appearing in Richard’s mouth, and then back in Red’s hand. This isn’t the last instance of a coin being used as a thematic marker for an important event in “Part Six”. We’ll come across another one with Deputy Hawk later on.  For the first time since Fire Walk With Me, we make our way back to the Fat Trout Trailer Park and see Carl Rodd (Harry Dean Stanton) taking his daily car ride into town. For what purpose, we don’t know yet. A neighbor (played by Jeremy Lindholm) asks if he can ride along and while they sit together, Carl asks him about his wife Linda. It’s hard to not recall “Part One” here, specifically when the Giant told Cooper in the black and white lodge to “remember 430, Richard, and Linda.” Already, we’ve met a Richard of obvious importance (Richard Horne), but no Linda yet. Could this be her? Let’s keep it in mind for later. True to Stanton’s style, Carl lights up a cigarette in the car and, seeing his neighbor eyeing it, offers him one, which he doesn’t take because he quit a year ago. Carl laughs at this and tells him he’s been smoking every day for 75 years, and then flashes his veneers, which, as a person currently trying to quit, enables me to quit quitting myself. Eventually, Carl makes his way to what must be his favorite park bench, where he enjoys another cigarette and a cup of coffee while staring up at the trees. Nearby, a young mom (Lisa Coronado) and her son engage in a strange game of tag and he watches them with a smile.  A short distance away, however, Richard is ramming around in his truck, still enraged from his meeting with Red, and in an intersection that looks exactly like the one where MIKE confronted Leland Palmer in Fire Walk With Me, runs a stop sign and mows the little boy down. He races away and a teacher (Sarah Jean Long), who we earlier saw enjoying two pieces of cherry pie at the RR Diner (in a snarky meta jab at the fans), gets a clear view of his face as he speeds past her. Carl goes over to comfort the mom of the dead boy and sees the boy’s spirit rise into the sky in the form of a yellow ball of light. From here, there’s a cut to a wood pole with the number 6 on it, which is located near his trailer and was previously highlighted in Fire Walk With Me. What’s the significance of spending so much time showing this particular numbered sign? Well, if you read your Secret History of Twin Peaks, you’d know there’s more to Carl than we think (keyword: abduction).  From here, we’re back in the high-rise building, where Duncan Todd (Patrick Fischler), a man presumably hired by Evil Cooper, sits at his desk typing on a laptop. As he’s typing, a red square appears on his screen and he clicks it away and then uses a tissue to retrieve a file from his safe. The file, which he places on the desk like it’s a disgusting turd, has a black dot on it. We briefly flash from here to Rancho Rosa to see the cops investigating Dougie’s burnt up car, and then back to the folder with the dot on it, which a creepy short man in a hotel has now received. Before receiving the file he’s playing some manner of dice game and then marking things down in a notebook, as though he’s calculating the many number of ways the dice can land. Slowly, he removes a picture of Lorraine (Tammie Baird) from “Part Five” and another of Dougie, using an ice pick to stab both in an obscene matter. Of course, it’s a classic case of foreshadowing, as we soon watch the man use that same ice on Lorraine and her co-workers in what’s arguably one of the most violent scenes in the revival so far.  Once again, over at the Lucky 7 Insurance building, the elevator doors open to Cooper, only now he’s in his trademark black suit. Sadly, he’s not back to his true form just yet, but seeing this suit again gives us hope that maybe the days of blubbering Dougie will soon be behind us. As expected, he gets called into his boss’ office, where he’s initially yelled at for scribbling all over his claim forms like a child, but then, after going through them for awhile, the scribbles seem to take on some meaning and his boss actually winds up thanking him. The two end their meeting by “agreeing” to keep this discovery between them and with what might be the weirdest and most awkward hand shake of all time.  Back at the Twin Peaks Sheriff Department, Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) is using the restroom when a coin falls from his pocket and rolls into a stall next to him. He goes to retrieve it and sees that it’s an Indian head nickel. Remember how the Log Lady told him that his heritage will help him piece all this together? Well, he also hasn’t forgotten and he holds onto this nickel for dear life while, at the exact same moment, he sees an Indian on a manufacturer’s plaque on the bathroom stall door (specifically, his family tribe, the Nez Perce) and knows right then and there that he’s being led to something by the cosmic forces overseeing so many of that town’s many mysteries. He goes and gets a ladder and a tool to pry the top layer of metal off the stall door and reaches down to pull out a couple pages of folded paper. Are these the missing pages from Laura’s diary that are mentioned many times in the original series, as well as Fire Walk With Me? Many signs point to yes, but we’ve been pointed to yes and arrived at no before. So, we’ll just have to wait and see.

"“The Bachelorette” star Rachel Lindsay is engaged to Bryan Abasolo.  Interested in The Bachelorette? Add The Bachelorette as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Bachelorette news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  After weeks of narrowing down her suitors from 31 men, the 32-year-old trial attorney from Dallas chose the 37-year-old Colombian chiropractor living in Miami.  Abasolo had sparks with Lindsay from the very first episode of the show’s latest season, even passionately kissing her before the competition. The bold move not only helped him secure the first impression rose, but also, it seems, solidified a permanent place in Lindsay's heart.  Lindsay chose her fiancé over finalists Peter Kraus, the 31-year-old business owner from Madison, Wisconsin, and Eric Bigger, the 29-year-old Baltimore native.  Big thanks to @therachlindsay for taking me on one of the greatest dates of my life! #thebachelorette A post shared by Dr. Bryan Abasolo (@thebryanabasolo) on Jun 26, 2017 at 7:26pm PDT  The bride-to-be chose Abasolo after a romantic date on a hot air ballon in Spain. It was also after Lindsay had a tearful goodbye with Kraus because he just wasn't ready to propose.  The bachelorette admitted that because of her emotional goodbye to Kraus, who was emphatic about only proposing if he was absolutely sure and not because the show's season finale was set to air, she wasn't as prepared as she could've been at the final rose ceremony.  ""I’ve never been more confused than I have this week,"" she told Abasolo. ""I was trying to find cracks in what seemed like the perfect foundation.""  But Lindsay said she couldn't find any. ""I see my forever,"" she told him. ""I see my future.""  That meant Abasolo was left to do one thing: propose.  ""I am the best version of myself when I'm with you,"" he said. ""You are so easy and effortless to love and I just want to love you for the rest of your life. Will you be my cariña [sweetheart] forever?""  Lindsay jumped up and down, saying yes.  It was clear from the very first episode that Lindsay, the first African-American bachelorette in the 13-season history of the franchise, was serious about finding love.  On the season premiere, she explained why she turned to the reality show to help her find a life partner and husband.  ""I have neglected other areas of my life,"" Lindsay explained. ""It's hard to take off that lawyer hat and put on the other one [to find love].""  Lindsay and Abasolo said they're not rushing to plan a wedding. Right now, ""we just want to bring our lives together,"" the future groom said.  But the two have agreed on one thing: a winter wedding.  “I’m from Texas ... obviously,"" Lindsay said explaining her preference,"" but we’re not rushing anything."""	0

Who’s who in Pippa Middleton's young bridal party Your guide to newlyweds Pippa and James’ bridesmaids and pageboys  Prince George and Princess Charlotte looked adorable at the wedding of their aunt Pippa Middleton on Saturday, as she married her fiancé James Matthews.

Former president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest.

"(CNN) -- It may be a case of wishful thinking, but a British tabloid is reporting that Kim Kardashian may be pursuing a music career again.  According to The Sun, the newlywed has enlisted the help of husband Kanye West as well as vocal and songwriting coaches to help her break into the industry.  Now, we say wishful thinking because embarking on such a venture would just give folks the opportunity to write even more about Kardashian (raising our hands over here, too). That's the whole point, isn't it?  Still, it's not that she hasn't tried before.  Remember the reality star's single, ""Jam (Turn It Up),"" from 2011? Most people probably don't. The song gained practically no traction.  In 2012 Kardashian was quoted as saying that she would never try to launch a singing career. ""No, I'd never (make another single), that was just for fun, and for charity,"" she said at the time.  Proceeds from her single, which failed to make the charts, reportedly went to fund St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital."	1
Kathy Griffin is said to feel betrayed by friend and CNN host Anderson Cooper after she was axed from the network over the Trump severed head photo scandal.  The comedian had expected Cooper to stand by her as she was hit with a wave of criticism after posting an image earlier this week in which she appeared to be holding Donald Trump's severed head, sources told Page Six.  Instead, Griffin was fired from her post as Cooper's New Year's Eve co-host on CNN - which she has done for the last 10 years - about 24 hours after he publicly condemned her actions.  Cooper wrote on his personal account Tuesday: 'For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.'  A source told Page Six: 'Kathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.'  Scroll down for video  Kathy Griffin gave a tearful press conference on Friday after being hit with a wave of criticism for posting an image in which she appeared to be holding Donald Trump's severed head  Kathy Griffin is said to feel betrayed by friend and CNN host Anderson Cooper after she was axed from the network over the Trump severed head photo scandal  Griffin broke down in tears during a press conference with her lawyer Lisa Bloom on Friday when she was asked to comment on Cooper's criticism of her.  'That hurt, that's all,' she said tearfully.  The 56-year-old had already apologized for the photo on Tuesday before deciding to hold the press conference, during which she accused Trump and his family of launching a campaign to destroy her life.  A top Hollywood publicist told The Wrap that Griffin's news conference only made things worse.  'If she were my client, I'd tell her to shut the f*** up,' the unnamed publicist said.  'You're not talking to anyone and you're certainly not talking to Lisa Bloom anymore.'  On Friday, Griffin tearfully detailed the torrent of abuse she has been receiving online and the constant death threats.  She stated however that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully.'  Griffin said her career was likely over now as a result of the incident, and that President Trump had 'broke' her, moments after she declared: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!'  She said at one point that this would not be happening to her if she was a 'white man.'  Breaking it down: Griffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate'  Griffin's long-time co-host Anderson Cooper also criticized her on Twitter  Response: First lady Melania Trump (above on election night with Barron and Donald) rushed to protect her son, saying' 'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing.'  Her lawyer Lisa Bloom also suggested during the press conference that despite reports, Barron was likely not that upset after seeing the image of Griffin with the decapitated head by stating the child was 'allegedly' traumatized.  'We don't know that. You're assuming that everything that Trump says is true, and in fact, we know that everything Trump says is false,' said Bloom.  It was also confirmed at the press conference that the Secret Service is investigating Griffin over the image, with the comedian saying: 'Yeah I might get arrested today. I don't care.'  Griffin's criminal lawyer Dimitry Goran also joined her Friday.  'I am really nervous, I have never done a press conference,' said Griffin after she was introduced by her lawyer.  After making a few jokes and stating that she stands by the apology she released earlier this week, Griffin said: 'The president and his grown children and the first lady are personally trying to ruin my life forever.'  She then went back to that notion a few moments later, speaking in disbelief as she reiterated her claim that 'this president of all people is going to come after' an 'obnoxious comedian.'  Griffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate.'  Tough day: Kathy Griffin broke down in tears speaking about the constant attacks from the public and members of the Trump family over the past few days  She added that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully'  Aggressors: Griffin declared at one point: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!' (Griffin and Trump together in 2010 on the season finale of The Apprentice with Brandy Kuentzel and Stephanie Castagnier)  Back in the day: Griffin and President Trump first met in 1995 she revealed in a recent interview, and he guest starred on her sitcom 'Suddenly Susan' in 1997 (above)  'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin of President Trump  That became clear soon after when she announced that she would not stop attacking President Trump just because he had targeted her.  'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin.  She then made a point of adding: 'I am not going to threaten him, I have no desire to harm him.'  Griffin was also ready with some thoughts on why President Trump had elected to attack her while his son Don Jr. called for her to be fired from her jobs.  'They are using me as the shining object so no one talks about his FBI investigation,' said Griffin.  She then revealed that all she wanted to do was get back to work, something that is becoming difficult with five venues cancelling her show in the wake of the incident.  'I'm not for everybody,. I am barely an acquired taste frankly,' admitted Griffin.  'I've had everybody turn on me. And I just want to make people laugh.'  That being said, Griffin declared: 'I am not laying down for this guy.'  She later added towards the end of the press conference: 'It's a good time to be a comedian but a scary time to be a citizen.'  The comedian did not however say anything about her relationship with President Trump, who she has known for 20 years.  She also worked with him multiple times over the course of her career, most recently in the 2010 finale of 'The Apprentice,' where she also appeared alongside Ivanka and Don Jr.  Calm before the storm: Griffin was seen arriving to the press conference on Friday morning (above)  Team: Griffin arrived with a group of three men including boyfriend Randy Bick (left) and a man who appeared to be a bodyguard (right)  Griffin also said that it was Megyn Kelly who inspired her to take the image, saying: 'I started thinking of that Megyn Kelly thing. By the way, I'm sure Megyn Kelly can't stand me. I thought of that blood coming out of her eyes blood or coming out of her wherever.'  The comedian and Kelly previously had a run-in this past December at a Women In Hollywood breakfast.  Kelly was the emcee of the event, and when she began to speak about President Trump things took a turn.  'I have high hopes for him. Despite the tweets and all the rest of it, there is much to admire about Donald Trump,' said Kelly, which immediately elicited booing from a few people, the loudest being comedian Kathy Griffin.  'There is. Stop that, stop that. There's room for the loyal opposition in this country,' said Kelly at that point, a comment which resulted in Griffin screaming, 'F*** him.'  Kelly then responded: 'Guess who that is? Kathy Griffin.'  Griffin later explained how things went down the day of the shoot.  'Let's make this really obvious that I'm making an absurdist, artsy thing,' said Griffin.  'For a few photos, I was holding up this wig head and we kept making the hair crazier.'  She went on to explain: ' We just took these pictures, it was interesting. There were a few people in the house. I didn't do anything for money.'  Griffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'  It was an emotional appearance for Griffin, who most difficult moment came when she began to wail while saying of President Trump: 'He broke me. He broke me. He broke me.'  That was when Griffin said she realized that 'this isn't right.'  'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin.  'I had learned over the years that sometimes when you do standup, people want a joke that's out there and a little crazy.'  She went on to say: 'I feel horrible. I have performed in war zones. Trust me, if we could redo the whole thing I'd have a blowup doll and ketchup. If you don't stand up you get run over.'  Thus far, Griffin had had five tour dates cancelled, lost her endorsement deal with Squatty Potty and been fired by CNN.  Griffin also found some time for humor, joking about President Trump at one point by saying: 'If you meet him he wants to call you The Donald. I said I am The Kathy, and that went over his nest.'  She also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson.'  Her lawyer Lisa Bloom meanwhile seemed to dismiss the idea that Barron Trump, 11, was disturbed by the image, saying he was 'allegedly traumatized'  Photoshop protest: A man rushed the podium at one point holding an image of Griffin with Bloom's decapitated head (above)  A little mystery to figure out: Griffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'  Been around the block: 'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin.  Smile through the tears: She also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson'  Griffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December  Griffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December in an interview with Vulture.  'Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,' said Griffin.  'For me, that's Trump and all things Trump. It's not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It's his turn.'  She continued: 'So I'm happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump - and also to Barron. You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I'll go direct for Barron. I'm going to get in ahead of the game.'  That comment spurred Don Jr. to comment after Griffin's interview, writing on Twitter: 'To put everything into perspective this is a must read from Dec 16 even states it's ok to go after Barron an 11 y/o.'  Most would take issue with an adult targeting a child for ridicule, but Griffin's lawyer said on Friday that she should not have lost any jobs over this image.  The only reason she did lose those jobs however explained Bloom, was because of the Trump family.  'As a result of the first family bullying her, she has been vilified, getting death threats, fired from multiple jobs and had multiple events canceled,' said Bloom.  Those death threats are more serious than the loss of work for Griffin, who said: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed.'  Griffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you.'  Bloom also stressed her client's impeccable record and the fact that she has never committed an act of violence or assault before, stating: 'Kathy never imagined it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended.'  The victim's rights lawyer, who also represented a number of former employees who are suing Fox News, also noted of the photo shoot: 'This was clearly a parody of Trump's own sexist remarks, taken to an extreme, edgy visual.'  She used her introduction to explain why President Trump's actions against Griffin were such a problem.  'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom.  'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented.'  Griffin also pointed out what she claimed was another difference between herself and President Trump, saying: 'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what.'  Comparisons: 'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom  Truce: Bloom added: 'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented'  Inconsolable: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed,' said Griffin (above)  Warning shot: Griffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you'  'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what,' said Griffin  Griffin thinks that ultimately she was targeted because of her sex and her level of fame.  'It's quite clear they're trying to use me as a distraction and I'm not going to be collateral damage for this fool,' said Griffin.  'I'm the easiest target. I'm D-list comedian Kathy Griffin.'  And while she wanted to stay quiet, she was afraid about others suffering a fate similar to her own she explained on Friday.  'He broke me and then I was like 'No, this isn't right,'' said Griffin.  'I apologized because was the right thing to do. Then it became a mob mentality pile-on.'  Griffin, who said she is '110 pounds when wet,' went on to explain: 'He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, having a celebrity feud He's using the power of the government.'  Bloom made a similar comment, stating: 'The message was clear: Criticize the president, lose your job.'  She also noted: 'Ted Nugent threatened to kill President Obama. President Trump invited him to the White House.'  The lawyer's anger towards President Trump also turned a but personal at one point it seemed, when she shouted out at one reporter: 'There's a lot of disgusting stuff on the news every day, like the fact that [President Trump is] making us the laughing stock of the world.'  Getaway: Griffin was seen being driven home by her longtime boyfriend Bick after her press conference on Friday  Pricey ride: The couple were riding in a Maserati Quattroporte, which start at over $100,000  Eyes forward: Griffin did not look at the photographers as she made her exit out of her attorney's office  Safe and sound: The comedian's bodyguard could be seen sitting in the backseat of the car  Griffin spoke about President Trump at length in an interview this past March with CityBeat Cincinnati, revealing that the two had known one another for two decades.  'I've known him off and on since 1995,' said Griffin.  'I feel very privileged to be able to bring my own personal run-ins with 'The Cheeto' to audiences all over, but most importantly to Cincinnati. The Taft Theatre audience needs to hear from someone who has met him several times'  Griffin admitted in the interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of President Trump.  'I found him to always be a buffoon,' she explained.  'But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless.'  She then revealed that President Trump would often ask her to not go after him during her stand-up routines.  'Almost every time I've run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, 'Uh, oh, don't be too hard on me. I know you're going to be funny, but you can be tough,'' said Griffin.  'I find that fascinating.'  She also mentioned that one of her best friends, the late Joan Rivers, was also incredibly close to President Trump.  'I think she got a kick out of him, but I don't think she knew this side of him,' said Griffin.  'I don't know if anybody knew he was this racist and stupid, because I think you assume that people who have done well in one area or another have a certain acumen or certain talents.'  Rough week: She said that she has been receiving constant death threats, which she described as detailed and specific  Not a fan: Griffin admitted in a March interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of Trump  Explanation: 'I found him to always be a buffoon. But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless,' said Griffin  Plea: 'Almost every time I've run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, 'Uh, oh, don't be too hard on me. I know you're going to be funny, but you can be tough,'' said Griffin  Griffin was roundly criticized after posting the photo earlier this week, with everyone from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton to her good friend Anderson Cooper publicly stating that the photo and accompanying video was 'appalling' and 'disgusting.'  President Trump also spoke out after seeing the photo, as did his son Don Jr., daughter-in-law Lara and the First Lady.  Meanwhile, the harsh words keep coming for Griffin, with Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey the latest to take aim at the entertainer, saying at a news conference on Thursday: 'She's disgusting. And it's completely outrageous. I don't think anybody should hire her again for anything.'  Bloom has also been receiving her fair share of negative notes, with the lawyer Tweeting Friday morning: 'To all you sending me hate mail today for my representation of Kathy Griffin, I have this message for you. XO Lisa'  She then included an image of an affirmation that read: 'The Devil whispered in my ear, 'You're not strong enough to withstand the storm.'  'Today I whispered in the Devil's ear, 'I am the storm.''  The four Trumps who denounced Griffin all stressed the fact that there are young children in the family who were traumatized by the image.  Don Jr. was the first to speak out, with the oldest Trump child taking to Twitter soon after the image was posted on Tuesday.  He posted twelve tweets in the span of 24 hours, with many calling for CNN to fire Griffin.  'Dear @CNN, I must have missed your statement banning your commentator #KathyGriffin from future shows. Please resend. Thx,' wrote Don Jr. in one tweet.  He also responded to tweets from CNN anchors Jake Taper and Cooper after they reprimanded Griffin on the social media site, asking why she still had not been fired and if they would work with the comedian in the future.  The men did not engage Don Jr., and on Wednesday it was announced that CNN had terminated Griffin from their annual New Year's Eve show.  Don Jr. also brought up his two oldest children, daughter Kai and son Don III in one tweet, writing: 'And I'm counting down having to explain it to my 8 and 10 year olds who I'm sure will see/hear about it at school.'  Loud and proud: 'I got no comment. The thing is, when you make art you go to stand by it,' Shields said while out shopping, hours after Griffin lost her CNN job (pair above in early May)  Commander-in-chief: President Trump tweeted to say the comedian should 'be ashamed of herself'  Nonstop: Don Jr. repeatedly called for Griffin to be fired from her job at CNN< which she was on Wednesday  That was the line President Trump took that same day, writing on Twitter:'Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!'  The most damning statement however came from the First Lady, who has done her best to stay out of the many controversies that have mired her husband's presidency.  'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,' said Melania just hours after a report emerged claiming that her son Barron initially thought that his father had been decapitated when he saw the image on TV.  'When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.'  Lara was the last to speak out, and targeted the photographer Tyler Shields.  The daughter-in-law of President Trump expressed how appalled she was during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night, before going on to state that Griffin is not the only person who should be getting heat for the incident.  'She has many people around her. There was a photographer involved. I'm sure she has a publicist that works with her,' said Lara.  'There were a lot of people around that could have said, 'You know what, this crosses a line.''  The publicists who represent Griffin at PMK•BNC told DailyMail.com that they were not involved in the photo shoot.  Lara also said during her Fox News appearance that the family was doing their best to take this latest incident in stride, but struggling in the wake of reports which revealed that Barron was terrified after seeing the image of his father on television.  'I'd love to say that it gets easier. It doesn't get easier, but we can handle it' explained Lara.  'We've taken it for almost two years and we understand that this is the world we live in and we've accepted it, in a way.'  'It tells you the society that we live in today and what some people deem acceptable,' Lara, who is expecting her first child with husband Eric, later said in the interview.  'Had this happened to President Obama, I can only imagine what people would be saying right now.'  Shields meanwhile continues to stand by the image.  'I got no comment. The thing is, when you make art you go to stand by it,' Shields said during the exchange outside Gelson's supermarket, which was posted by TMZ.  When asked if he would do it again, maybe with another politician, Shield simply said: 'I cant censor myself'  Lashing out: Lara Trump (above) criticized Kathy Griffin during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night  Even former first daughter Chelsea Clinton was quick to express her outrage at Griffin tweeting: 'This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president  As for Griffin, Sheilds said he had spoken to his friend and subject and that the two were good in the wake of the photo shoot.  He then wrapped things up by stating: 'I'm just going to go home and eat my ice cream.'  In footage of the shoot, Griffin is seen joking that she and Shields will have to flee the country once it gets out.  'We have to move to Mexico today,' she said, 'because we're gonna go to prison. Federal prison.  'Call your dad, apologize, then let's you [and me] go to Mexico because we're not surviving this.'  She's seen in the footage lifting the grisly 'head' out of a metal bowl, then rotating it towards the camera until it hits a spot that Shields likes.  Finally, at Shields' demand, she drops it to the ground.  In the video, Griffin also joked: 'Tyler and I are not afraid to do images that make noise. And also he often lights me to the point where I look about 15.  'But first I'm an artist. But really it's good lighting.'  Griffin apologized on Tuesday for posting the video following a furious backlash and a hint at an investigation by Secret Service, which has now been confirmed.  The controversial entertainer tweeted: 'I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.'	1
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)	0
"We're still processing the season two finale of Stranger Things . Sure, things ended on—spoiler warning—a positive note at the Snow Ball , but we have a feeling the crew isn't finished with the mysteries of the Upside Down just yet. (Um, remember that haunting last shot of the Mind Flayer?) And then there are the blossoming romances: Eleven and Mike! Max and Lucas! Puppy love has honestly never looked cuter. There's also Nancy's love triangle with Jonathan and Steve to think about, not to mention the adorable, and unexpected, friendship between Dustin and Steve. Plus, what the hell is going to happen between Joyce and Sheriff Hopper? It's only a matter of time before they get together, right?  Like we said, there's a lot to think about—and it looks like our questions will be answered sooner rather than later. Netflix confirmed in December 2017 that a third season of Stranger Things is officially happening. The streaming platform posted a poll on its Twitter page asking if another season of the show should happen, and shortly after we received an answer: ""FOR THE LOVE OF STEVE, DUH! So hold tight baby darts—season three is officially happening."" See the tweet for yourself, below:  Excited? So are we. Granted, season three is in development, but here's what we know so far (some spoilers from seasons one and two ahead):  1. Writers are still bouncing around ideas. At the time of the second-season premiere in late October, cocreator Matt Duffer revealed the third season had been in the writers' room for only about two days. In other words, even the showrunners don't know much about the plot right now.  2. Season three will start off with a ""clean slate."" That's what the Duffer brothers told The Hollywood Reporter. And this makes sense: Remember, the Upside Down has been closed, so that danger isn't looming over them anymore. Of course, there's the issue of that pesky Mind Flayer hovering over the school, which is certainly going to cause some trouble. ""[The Mind Flayer is still out there],"" Ross Duffer also told THR. ""They've shut the door on the Mind Flayer, but not only is it still there in the Upside Down, it's very much aware of the kids, and particularly Eleven.""  3. There are more like Eleven and Eight. We were introduced to Kali, another child experimented on at the Hawkins Lab, this season on Stranger Things. Her nickname is Eight, like Jane's is Eleven, and the Duffer brothers told E! there are more siblings out there who we don't know about. ""I think we've clearly implied there are other numbers, and I can't imagine that the world will only ever know Eleven and Eight,"" Matt Duffer said.  4. There's no more Hawkins Lab. It's closed up shop for good, according to this article from Collider.  5. Expect to see more of Erica, Lucas' iconic little sister. ""We were able to integrate more of her in [season two], but not as much you want because the story [was] already going. ‘We got to use more Erica’—that was one of the first things we said in the writers room [for three],” Ross told Yahoo .  6. Max and Eleven won't be enemies. Why the showrunners decided to make these two young girls hate each other in season two is a mystery. However, Ross contends they won't be adversaries for long. ""They won’t be enemies,"" he told HelloGiggles . ""They won’t be enemies forever. We’re excited [to] spend more time with Max and develop her in a way…we’re sort of scratching the surface on this season of what I think she’s capable of.”  7. There will be another time jump. The Duffer brothers confirmed this to THR as well, but how many years or months exactly is still unknown. Our money's on exactly one year, just like season two.  8. You'll see a new side of Karen Wheeler. One of the funniest scenes of season two involved a flirtatious moment between Mike and Nancy's mom and bad boy Billy. Turns out, that's not a onetime thing. ""You will see that side of her explored,"" executive producer Shawn Levy told us . ""We have much more story for Karen that is linked to her discontent and her dissatisfied sexuality. In the end, there wasn’t room [in season two] to service all the ideas. Some ideas got punted to next season and maybe beyond, but we’re not done with Karen Wheeler and her failing marriage.”  9. The ""Starcourt Mall"" will be a central location. The show teased this new set on Twitter in July 2018.  10. We have the episode names. They are, in order: ""Suzie, Do You Copy?"", ""The Mall Rats,"" ""The Case of the Missing Lifeguard,"" ""The Sauna Test,"" ""The Source,"" ""The Birthday,"" ""The Bite,"" and ""The Battle of Starcourt.""

Rosanna Arquette is spilling the beans on the one who got away.  The actress, 58, was on Thursday’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen where she was asked by a fan if she’d ever turned down a Hollywood star when her own was rising in the ’80s thanks to films like Desperately Seeking Susan and The Big Blue.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Warren Beatty,” she answered, to a surprised-looking Cohen. The night’s other guest, Laverne Cox, asked Arquette the question on everyone’s mind: “Why did you say no to Warren Beatty, girl?”  “He’s very handsome, beautiful, but it just didn’t feel like it was for me,” she explained. “But that was in the old, old days.”  Beatty is of course now married to Annette Bening, who Arquette described as “the greatest.” The two wed in 1992 and share four children — Stephen Ira, 25, Benjamin, 23, Isabel, 20, and Ella, 17.  RELATED: How Annette Bening Tamed Hollywood Bachelor Warren Beatty: ‘Every Day She Surprises Me’  During her visit, Arquette also revealed her family is suffering “PTSD” over her sister Alexis’ death almost two years ago. “It’s been fractured and hard since Alexis passed. It’s been really painful for all of us. We’re in PTSD,” the actress said.  RELATED VIDEO: Sideswiped’ Star Rosanna Arquette Reveals Why the Film Came at Such a Crucial Time in Her Life  Alexis passed away at 47 years old from complications stemming from HIV, which she had contracted almost 30 years earlier. She was one of the first transgender activists in Hollywood.	0
Mario Anzuoni/Reuters/Splash When it comes to Hollywood, there are certain questions people can't help but ask -- like what's up with the hot celeb guys named Chris? And who is Brad Pitt dating? This Hollywood heartthrob has been in the public eyes for many years, which means his relationships have, too. Although fans know all the details about Brad Pitt and his marriages to Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston, he actually did quite a bit of dating in his former years (think '80s and '90s). And some of the women he's reportedly been with might cause a shock!  Advertisement  Brad Pitt's dating history shows that he has had his fair share of costar romances, one-off dates (including a somewhat long list of singers, actresses, and models, possibly even a professor), and many serious relationships that led up to engagements -- four of them to be exact! And though the status of his relationships isn't always clear, we know that Brad does not exactly have a lot of trouble when it comes to finding someone new to spend his time with.  The famous single dad of six has always been a good-looking guy, with many of his exes calling him sweet and nice. (After all, he is Brad Pitt.) This man has definitely had a lot of love in his life, so here is a guide to Brad Pitt's complicated dating history.	1
Sixth’s time’s the charm for Laura Dern: The actress took home her first Primetime Emmy Award for her supporting role in the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies at the 69th annual ceremony Sunday night in Los Angeles.  “I share this with my tribe of four ladies,” said Dern, referring to costars Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. “I feel very proud to be reflecting fierce women and mothers finding their voice.  “I’m just incredibly blessed and I feel so stoked to be here with you.”  Dern won for her portrayal of Renata Klein, a bigwig working mother who finds herself locked in battle with the other mom of Monterey when her daughter is the victim of bullying. Dern costarred with Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspooon, and Shailene Woodley in the adaptation of Liane Moriarty’s best-selling novel.  Dern’s previous Emmy nominations have spanned the gamut, from her nod for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama series in 1994’s Fallen Angels to her 2013 nomination for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Enlightened.  Dern beat out Woodley as well as fellow nominees Regina King (American Crime), Michelle Pfeiffer (The Wizard of Lies), and Judy Davis and Jackie Hoffman (Feud: Bette and Joan).

"It has been seven years since Jennifer Aniston and John Mayer called it quits.  But according to Andy Cohen, the iciness between the actress, 47, and the singer, 39, still hasn't thawed.  According to an excerpt from his new book Superficial, which was obtained by Radar Online, the pair had an extremely 'awkward' run-in earlier this year.  'Awkward': Andy Cohen has revealed that exes John Mayer and Jennifer Aniston had a run-in earlier this year. They are seen here in 2009 at the hotel where they bumped into each other  Andy revealed that he was meeting his close friend John for a drink at the popular Sunset Tower hotel in West Hollywood and found Jennifer sitting with her Friends co-stars Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox at the only other table there.  The 48-year-old said he 'began asking John when was the last time he saw Aniston, how awkward this was, and if there were ways I could make it more awkward'.  Andy added: 'We realized they had to walk by our table to leave and that would be a ""moment."" We wondered if it was more fun at our table or theirs.'  Snubbed: The Friends star (shown in September) apparently ignored the singer (pictured last month) when they were seated near each other at the Sunset Tower hotel  The Watch What Happens Live host suggested that John join him in going over to say hello, but that John made it very clear this would be a bad idea.  'He told me with a look that the Queen of Smartwater would not be having it,' he wrote.  According to Radar, Andy and John left first and the bitter exes didn't have to come face to face.  Juicy: Andy, who is close friends with John, recalled the encounter in his new book Superficial  John and Jennifer dated on and off for a year from 2008 to 2009.  The Your Body Is A Wonderland hit-maker described his feelings for Jennifer in 2010 during an interview with Playboy.  'We just have a regard for each other’s feelings that is pretty intense,' he said. 'It’s been a deep relationship, and it’s no longer taking place at all. Have you ever loved somebody, loved her completely, but had to end the relationship for life reasons?'  Not so amicable exes: John has discussed ending his relationship with Jen 'for life reasons' in the years following their split in 2009. They are pictured in 2008  He later told Rolling Stone: 'I've never really gotten over it. It was one of the worst times of my life.'  John has also dated the likes of Jessica Simpson and Taylor Swift, most recently ending a relationship with Katy Perry in 2015 after dating on and off for three years.  Meanwhile Jennifer has been in a relationship with Justin Theroux for five years, and they celebrated their first wedding anniversary in August."	1
SHARE this story with your friends!Share Tweet ShareWell, well, well…it looks like Obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them FOR) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards.After a breaking story about the scandal hit Russian news, multiple sources have confirmed the story. The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates on this breaking scoop.	1

I don't know why I chose to watch the Miss Universe Pageant this past Sunday, December 20. I usually don't enjoy those types of shows, but I'm very glad I watched, because I was able to see Steve Harvey make his now-famous mistake in announcing the winner of Miss Universe 2015. My happiness has nothing to do with schadenfreude, though, as I take no pleasure in the suffering of others.  The reason why I felt fortunate to witness this incredibly awkward moment was because it illustrated to me an important lesson both in human frailty and in human resilience. It was one of the worst possible things that could go wrong -- a horrendous faux pas played out in front of an audience of millions, followed by a surprising and excellent recovery which I saw as tremendously reassuring.  When we look at various lists our top fears, the fear of public speaking is always very close to the top, and it's because of of the underlying fear of making a fool of oneself.  Shame is a major source of anxiety for human beings. The sensation of shame is particularly painful because it includes not only feeling bad and stupid, but also small and ridiculous. Public shame is the worst of all. The anguish of being humiliated in front of our peers -- or, worse, those who we're hoping to impress -- can be excruciating.  Many people avoid speaking in public altogether for the express purpose of not allowing themselves to be put in a position that might result in their experiencing shame. Many people would rather do just about anything than speak in public.  So, when Steve Harvey botched the announcement of the winner of Miss Universe 2015, he realized one of our worst fears: he looked really bad in front of the contestants, his bosses and millions of people all around the world.  Mr. Harvey did the thing that we all fear when we contemplate speaking in public. He messed up. But then he turned around and surprised us. He recovered.  We can be so anxious about the possibility of looking foolish in public that our thoughts go no further than to the dreaded possibility of public humiliation.  We can't imagine standing there, as Mr. Harvey did, with egg on our face, having demonstrated our ineptitude to the masses. Equally, we wouldn't have contemplated how we might react if such a situation were to occur. We simply imagine that we'd die, right then and there, or at least wish that we were dead.  What Mr. Harvey showed us -- and why I was so happy to witness his big blunder -- was that we can mess up, look foolish and then we can make things right again.  Mr. Harvey showed us that it's possible for us to fall on our face but then stand up, brush ourselves off and carry on with our dignity intact. He showed us all-too-human fallibility, but also real class, courage and resilience.  I was very impressed by the way Mr. Harvey handled his error. He owned up to it, apologized for it, explained what happened without being defensive, and even begged the audience not to blame his error on the contestants.  He took responsibility for what had happened and he did the right thing. He didn't try to save face, minimize his mistake or laugh it off. He was serious, humble and appropriately contrite. He knew he'd messed up, and he did his best to make things right.  That night, all of us who were watching the pageant collectively cringed as we witnessed Mr. Harvey's mistake. We felt horrible for the young women involved and embarrassed for Mr. Harvey.  But then, as I reflected upon what I'd just seen, I realized that, although it was an incredibly uncomfortable moment, it was also an enormously valuable lesson for all of us to take in.  I really appreciate the way Mr. Harvey handled this situation. In fact, he did millions of people a huge favour. He realized one of our worst fears in as public a forum as one could imagine. And he didn't die. His head didn't explode. He didn't run off the stage and commit ritual suicide.  No, Mr. Harvey messed up, owned up, corrected the situation and survived. And he demonstrated to all of us that we too can mess up and survive, if we're willing to do the right thing, as he did.  So, Steve Harvey, thank you.  I know you weren't planning on being such an excellent role model, but as is often the case when things go sideways, amazing surprises can happen. Amazing choices can be made and powerful lessons can be learned.  The next time I get up on a stage somewhere and I'm about to give a talk, I'll remember Steve Harvey and the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. I'll remember that the worst happened and nobody died. I'll take a deep breath and remind myself that if he could mess up in front of millions of people and survive, I really have nothing to worry about, after all.

"Following speculation earlier this week that Meghan Markle was seen walking her dog outside Kensington Palace in London, it's only natural to wonder how the Duchess goes about her day-to-day life when she's not partaking in royal duties.  According to People, Meghan has a foolproof way for living a low-key life when she isn't working. As a source tells the publication, Meghan apparently ""spends most of her weekends in the Cotswolds with Harry. When she does venture out to Pilates or to get her hair done, she normally goes incognito under a baseball cap."" Just like in the movies, by wearing a cap and sunglasses, Meghan seems to manage going undetected in ordinary life.  Of course, Prince Harry and Meghan signed a two-year lease on a home in the Cotswolds following their May 2018 wedding, per Country Living. Based on the Great Tew Estate, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are able to escape London at the weekend. Notably, as Country Living reports, Soho Farmhouse, where Meghan had her spa-themed bachelorette party, is based nearby, making the Cotswolds a real home away from home for the former actress.  According to the Soho House website, the members' only club attracts mainly those working in ""film, fashion, advertising, music, art and media sectors,"" with Meghan's close friend, Markus Anderson, being a consultant for the brand.  Meghan and Harry are adjusting to their new life as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and it sounds as though they've found the perfect country hideaway to escape the limelight."	0
Corey Feldman has named one of his alleged abusers.  The “Goonies” star told Dr. Mehmet Oz on Thursday’s episode of the show that actor Jon Grissom molested him in the 1980s. Grissom starred with Feldman and the late Corey Haim in two films: “License to Drive” and “Dream a Little Dream.”  Feldman launched a campaign last month to finance a documentary that would expose the alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. He’s seeking $10 million to fund the film, and pay for attorneys and security for his own protection.  “That is him,” Feldman said Thursday on “The Dr. Oz Show” as the host held up a photo of Grissom on his phone. “That’s the guy.”  “This guy, on his Myspace page and his Facebook page has pictures of me and Corey Haim,” Feldman said. “He still taunts it and flaunts it.”  The actor had mentioned the alleged assaulter in his 2013 memoir, “Coreyography,” but changed his name to “Ron Crimson” for legal purposes.  “The lawyers made me change the names,” Feldman added. “They gave me a list of three or four names. I picked the one that sounded closest to his name.”  Oz and Feldman then called the Los Angeles Police Department to report the allegations.  Related Film Review: 'Corbin Nash' Corey Feldman Says He Was Stabbed, Police Investigating Incident  “It seems to me like they are going to take it seriously,” Feldman said. “They are going to do an interview with me when I get back to Los Angeles. However, they did give me the warning that based on the statute of limitations, they can only open an investigation, but they cannot promise that it will be prosecuted.”  The show later released a video saying its attorneys believe Grissom was imprisoned in 2003 for child molestation and is a “fugitive from justice” because he never registered as a sex offender.  Last week on “Megyn Kelly Today,” Feldman named former talent manager and convicted sex offender Marty Weiss, who he had also referred to in his memoir, as another abuser. He then teased a different name, saying, “The second one ran a child’s club in Hollywood … he’s working for the L.A. Dodgers.”	0

But now, it's being reported that they're getting married!  After their close friendship was described as a ""mother and daughter"" relationship, it's now said they've been dating in recent weeks.  And things are getting serious very quickly - despite their 47-year age gap.  If Caitlyn, 68, married 21-year-old transgender student Sophia, it would be her fourth marriage.  Before transitioning in 2015, she tied the knot three times as Bruce - to Chrystie Crownover in 1972, Linda Thompson in 1981, and to Kris Jenner in 1991.  (Image: ITV Picture Desk)  (Image: Getty Images North America)  Caitlyn has six biological children - two with each wife - and was step-father to Kris' kids, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian.  Now, a source close to the star has told Heat magazine: ""Cait really sees herself spending the rest of her life with Sophia.  ""She lost her support system when she fell out with her family and these days, it feels like Sophia's the only person she can count on.""  Earlier this year, it's said that Caitlyn turned to Sophia when her relationship with the Kardashians began to break down.  (Image: Instagram)  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  She's hardly been in touch with the famous family ever since she took a massive swipe at ex Kris in her autobiography, The Secrets Of My Life, released last year.  The source added to the mag: ""Cait is a complete outcast at the moment. She has also lost friends in the LGBT community because of her political views [backing Donald Trump].  ""She was really hoping to reconnect with the Kardashians, especially with Khloe and Kim having had babies, but sadly she hasn't met them, and she hasn't even got to spend much time with her new granddaughter Stormi [Kylie Jenner's baby]. She just wants some companionship and really felt all alone before she met Sophia.""  Caitlyn and Sophia live together and are rarely seen without one another by their sides.  (Image: caitlynjenner/Instagram)  (Image: REUTERS)  They're reportedly planning an intimate ceremony near Caitlyn's home in Malibu.  However, a source close to Caitlyn told Mirror Online that while they could be dating, marriage isn't on the cards just yet.  Back in January, Caitlyn made a number of revelations during her tell-all interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories.  And she said at the time she was open to dating men and women.  She said: ""It could be either. I don't know. It is kind of fun so see the world from the girl's side. You know."""	1

"The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films are an American series of superhero films based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The MCU is the shared universe in which all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007, and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 20 films, with 11 more in various stages of production. It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $17.5 billion at the global box office.  Kevin Feige has produced every film in the series, alongside Avi Arad for the first two releases, Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk, Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films, and Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp. The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson signed contracts to star in numerous films.  The first film in the series was Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008). Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing the films with the 2012 crossover film The Avengers,[1] which concluded Phase One of the franchise. Phase Two includes Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Ant-Man (2015).  Captain America: Civil War (2016) is the first film in the franchise's Phase Three, and is followed by Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), with Captain Marvel (2019) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) still scheduled for the phase. Spider-Man: Far From Home has also been scheduled for 2019, beginning Phase Four. Two untitled films are scheduled for 2020, three for 2021, and three for 2022. Sony Pictures distributes the Spider-Man films, which they continue to own, finance, and have final creative control over.[2]  Phase One  Iron Man (2008)  [15] produced Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. Avi Arad, who helped secure early financing,producedand  Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark builds himself a suit of armor after he is taken captive by a terrorist organization. Free from his captors, he decides to upgrade and don his armor in order to hunt down weapons that were sold under the table.[16]  In April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau to direct Iron Man,[4] with the writing teams of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing competing scripts.[4][17] Favreau consolidated both into one script, which was then polished by John August.[5] Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the title role in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part.[18] Principal photography began on March 12, 2007,[19] with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan,[20] which was filmed in Inyo County, California.[21] Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California,[22] with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base[23] and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[24] Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008,[25] and was released internationally on April 30, and in the United States on May 2.[26][27]  The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who approaches Stark regarding the ""Avenger Initiative"".

Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.[28] Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.[29]  The Incredible Hulk (2008)  After being exposed to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross. Hunted by the military, Banner seeks to cure himself and prevent his condition from being weaponized.[30]  In January 2006,[31] Marvel reclaimed the film rights for the Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk.[32] Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films.[32] Instead of moving forward with a sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot.[6] Leterrier initially turned down the job out of respect for Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on.[6] The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film.[33] In April 2006, Edward Norton entered negotiations to portray Bruce Banner and rewrite Penn's script,[34] although Penn received sole credit for the screenplay.[7] Production began on July 9, 2007 and filming primarily took place in Toronto,[35] with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro.[36] The film premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 8, 2008, and was released on June 13.[37][38]  The film takes place simultaneously with the events of Iron Man 2 and Thor,[39] the former of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Downey said that the filmmakers ""were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. The great thing is he—and I don't want to give too much away—but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really fun seeing him play this really powerful character who's half in the bag.""[41] In addition, Captain America is briefly seen frozen in ice in an alternate opening of the film, included in the DVD release.[42]  Iron Man 2 (2010)  Iron Man and Iron Man 2, helped establish the shared universe concept with his inclusion of Samuel L.

The film is set six months after the events of Iron Man,[40] and takes place simultaneously with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Thor.[39] The filmmakers continued to refer to other Marvel films by again including Captain America's shield. Favreau explained, ""We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. So now it really was in his room, so we had to figure out how to deal with the reality that the shield was in his workshop.""[29] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one pointing toward a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther.[56] A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts.[57][58] The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.[59]  Thor (2011)  Thor, crown prince of Asgard, is banished to Earth and stripped of his powers after he reignites a dormant war.

The film takes place simultaneously with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2,[39] the latter of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, ""Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [had] a very kind of small role in Iron Man.

The film is set two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War and before the events of Avengers: Infinity War.[342][343] In the mid-credits scene, Hank Pym, Hope van Dyne and Janet van Dyne are disintegrated as a result of the events of Avengers: Infinity War.[344]  Timeline  External image The Phase One Timeline infographic released by Marvel in May 2012[345]  During Phase One of the MCU films, Marvel Studios realised that they could line-up some of their films with Easter eggs and references, like having Nick Fury discuss the events of Thor during Iron Man 2. The events of those two films and The Incredible Hulk were ultimately set around the same time,[39] six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] This was not part of Marvel's long-term plans for the shared universe, especially as the studio became busy making more films per year.[39] The official tie-in comic Fury's Big Week confirmed that The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor all took place within a week, a year before the modern-day scenes from Captain America: The First Avenger which lead into the crossover film The Avengers. Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received ""the seal of approval"" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.[346] As promotion ahead of the release of The Avengers, Marvel released an official infographic detailing this timeline in May 2012.[345]  With Marvel no longer trying to complicate their timeline,[39] the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to The Avengers: Iron Man 3 takes place during Christmas about six months after that film,[124][126] Thor: The Dark World is set one year after it,[138] and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is two years after.[126] Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man ended the phase in 2015, with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.[201] For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so Captain America: Civil War begins a year after Age of Ultron,[235] with Avengers: Infinity War set two years after that.[333] However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually ""happen on top of each other"" while being less ""interlocked"" as the Phase One films were,[309] with Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming beginning a week and several months, respectively, after Civil War;[312][284] Thor: Ragnarok beginning four years after The Dark World and two years after Age of Ultron,[307][308] which Winderbaum said was around the same time as Civil War and Homecoming;[309] Doctor Strange taking place over a whole year and ending ""up to date with the rest of the MCU"";[255] Ant-Man and the Wasp also set two years after Civil War and shortly before Infinity War;[342] and both Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel Vol. 2 being explicitly set in 2014,[164][269] which Feige believed would create a four year gap between Vol. 2 and Infinity War, though the other MCU films do not specify years onscreen.[347]  When Spider-Man: Homecoming was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not line-up, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of Homecoming into the previous films, such as connecting it to The Avengers.[348] This was labelled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of The Avengers and the events of Civil War, which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline in which only four years should have passed.[285] Additionally, dialogue in Civil War indicates that eight years pass between the end of Iron Man and the events of that film, which also does not line-up with the established continuity which was closer to five-and-a-half years.[349] Infinity War co-director Joe Russo described the Homecoming eight years time jump as ""very incorrect"",[350] and the mistake was ignored in Infinity War which specified that its events were taking place only six years after The Avengers.[351] The public response to the Homecoming mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,[352] and in November 2018, a timeline specifying dates for the films' events was released as part of the sourcebook Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the MCU.[353]  Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years timeline from November 2018[353] Year(s) Feature films 1943–45 Captain America: The First Avenger 2010 Iron Man 2011 Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor 2012 The Avengers, Iron Man 3 2013 Thor: The Dark World 2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 2016 Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2016–17 Doctor Strange 2017 Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War  This timeline ignores the two ""eight-year"" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of Black Panther and Infinity War by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of Screen Rant described the timeline as ""the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set"", bringing ""some sense of balance to the MCU continuity"".[353] Following Infinity War, the Russo brothers said future films would not necessarily be set according to real time as there are ""a lot of very inventive ways of where the story can go from here"", with both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel set earlier in the timeline.[354]  Recurring cast and characters  List indicator(s) This table only includes characters which have appeared in multiple film franchises within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and have appeared in the billing block for at least two films.

Marvel had previously dated an untitled film for July 31, 2020, before removing it from their schedule in October 2018. In October 2016, Feige said it was a combination of knowing what films would occupy the 2020 dates and allowing some flexibility, saying, ""We know what [films] we'd like them to be for 2020. Over the years, where we're aiming we've been lucky enough that it's usually been the same thing but we always leave ourselves the opportunity to bob and weave and adapt if we have to. But we know where we're headed for 2020 and we have ideas and we're beginning to solidify the years beyond that.""[516] Feige and Marvel have additional storylines planned through 2028,[517] resulting in 20 films ""on the docket that are completely different from anything that's come before—intentionally.""[518]  In October 2014, in terms of Phase Four films, Feige said, for the time being, ""We're not going to talk specifically about the story of any of those films, the plot of any of those films, what happens to any of the characters in any of those films. In fact, even to talk about any of those characters – who will be involved in those movies – will be a bit of a spoiler as to what may or may not happen to them in earlier movies.""[190] In April 2016, Feige added, ""We're only working on what's been announced through the end of 2019. And it is still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond.""[519] A year later, Feige noted, ""We have an idea [of what the MCU looks like post-Infinity War], and it's gonna be very, very different"", but cautioned that Marvel would not be ""actively discussing anything past [Avengers: Endgame]"" besides dating the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and that James Gunn would be working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He also was not sure if Marvel would continue to group the films in phases once Phase Three concluded, that ""it might be a new thing"",[520] but Marvel was said to be using the term Phase Four in December 2018.[491]  Feige noted Marvel hoped to reveal additional films after the release of Avengers: Endgame.[521] A second sequel to Homecoming is planned.[522] Other potential film projects include:  Black Widow : In February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in Age of Ultron , he would like to see it explored further in a solo film.

‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.Frank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.Of Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.It is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.Below you can see the full charges against Mack and Raniere here.	1
Consider the hatchet buried for these two!  Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears have been battling feud rumors for years. The pair shot to fame around the same time and have similar career trajectories, so it’s no surprise that these pop stars have been known to be less than thrilled with each other.  However, on Thursday for International Women’s Day, Christina posted a video celebrating some fellow fierce female musicians, and Britney made the list! Looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship, and maybe even a collaboration in the near future? What other famous musicians are rumored to be feuding?	0
Cindy Crawford’s list of career highlights is miles long, but one of the supermodel’s top memories is filming her iconic 1992 Pepsi commercial.  “This time of year it always gets featured in the roundups of the Best Super Bowl Commercials ever, and every January I revisit my original Pepsi spot that I just love because the music was perfect and the little boys were perfect and it was just one of those commercials that everyone loved and it made people happy,” she tells PEOPLE.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  That sense of family and love is why Crawford is reuniting with the brand once again for the new “This Is The Pepsi” Super Bowl LII spot, which is part of the brand’s 2018 “Pepsi Generations” campaign celebrating all of its pop culture highlights through the decades (from Michael Jackson to Britney Spears!) while featuring its top drinks: Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar.  Cindy Crawford stars in new Pepsi Super Bowl spot  “This spot is a reminder of how much fun Pepsi has created for every generation,” Crawford shares. “It’s a look back at getting people excited for Pepsi now and the future. They’ve spent a long time creating all of these memorable moments and that’s exciting for me to because I really do consider myself part of the Pepsi family.”  For Crawford, this commercial (catch a 6-second teaser above!) was extra meaningful because it also brought together the generations in her own family. Her 18-year-old son Presley Gerber stars alongside her in the spot.  “To include now my next generation, Presley, just makes it that much more familial feeling,” she says. “I hope it gives people that warm, fuzzy feeling.”  Crawford says to work with Presley at this point in his career was “exciting.”  “We drove to work together, we shared a trailer, and just as a mom watching him perform, I was the proud stage mom standing by the monitor,” she says.  Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty  And Crawford’s 16-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber had a little FOMO when she heard about the commercial.  “I was saying to Kaia, ‘Presley and I are doing this commercial’ and she was like, ‘Wait, Presley and you? What about me?,'” Crawford shared. “I said, ‘Your time will come, honey, don’t worry.’ I think it would be fun for her to get to really re-create my original spot.” (The supermodel-in-training has already shared a Versace catwalk with her mom, so we think there’s a good chance that’ll happen.)  Courtesy Pepsi  Speaking about her debut Pepsi commercial, Crawford reveals that she still has those iconic denim cut-offs.  “They were my jeans that I wore that day and when we were doing wardrobe the stylist asked to just cut my jeans off,” she says. “Because your own jeans always fit you better if you’ve worn them awhile, so we just cut off my jeans and I got to keep my own jeans.”  Crawford wore the same cutoffs for the spot 10 years later, which had a cameo from her very young children.  “My kids were little so this actually Presley’s second Pepsi commercial,” she says. “The car in that one is not a Lamborghini, it’s an SUV, and I’ve got my two little kids in the back so they have been part of the Pepsi family really since they were little.”  But this time her look was totally different: a denim shirt, white jeans and boots.  “I don’t know if the shorts would still fit but this time we didn’t want to bring them back because the commercial is about passing onto the next generation, it was a nod to the old commercial without wearing the exact same outfit,” Crawford says. “Time has gone on and I have an 18-year-old son now. I think Kaia will wear them one day.”  So what is Super Bowl Sunday like at the Gerber household?  “It involves chili and some wings and Pepsi of course, and probably at a certain point, margaritas,” Crawford shares. “It’s about the tradition of getting together. Some years I watch less of the football, but I always look forward to the commercials and the halftime show. I think we are all in our busy current lifestyles, and we appreciate those things that bring people together. If you think about it that’s why award shows are fun too because you have a group of people sitting around together doing a shared experience — it’s social. And for me I love the social moment of the Super Bowl.”  See the full reveal of Crawford’s new Pepsi spot during Super Bowl LII on February 4 on NBC.	0
"Chris Rock is opening up about his intense divorce.  The 52-year-old comedian and his ex wife, Malaak Compton-Rock, split in 2014 after 19 years of marriage, and their divorce was finalized last August. They share two daughters together, 12-year-old Zahara and 14-year-old Lola. Rock covers Rolling Stone's latest issue, and in the revealing cover story, talks about his complicated marriage.  The story includes bits of Rock's stand-up routines over the past few months, in which he says he was unfaithful during the relationship.  NEWS: Chris Rock's Daughter's Girl Scout Cookies Brought Us 8 of the Greatest Moments in Oscar History  ""I was a piece of sh**,"" he tells the crowd during one comedy show.  According to the magazine, he later talks about his affairs and ""gets disarmingly specific, describing three women: one famous, one semifamous, and one a member of the retail class."" Now, the actor is clearly jaded to the idea of marriage.  ""Would I ever get married again?"" he says. ""Not if it would cure AIDS.""  Rolling Stone  The Grown Ups 2 star also talks about his fame in the interview, and how it played into the divorce.  ""My faults are magnified,"" he says. ""Your significant other, if they really love you, has a high opinion of you. And you let them down.""  Still, he says he's now toned down talking about his marriage out of respect for his ex-wife.  ""It's not fair,"" he notes. ""I have a mic, she doesn't. God forbid people are bugging her in the supermarket. That's not cool. I'm going to have to see her at weddings and graduations.""  Rock says he's never had a breakdown about his split, though admits he cried once during their custody battle.  ""We live in a world where men are assumed to not have feelings,"" he shares. ""All my friends assume I moved into the city after my divorce, away from my girls. When I say I bought a house around the corner, it blows their minds.""  The Saturday Night Live alum at one point gets candid while talking to the Rolling Stone writer, who is married with a toddler.  ""You got a kid now. You'll be fine. You need each other,"" he notes. ""Need is big. A woman breaks up with you, the first thing she says is 'I don't need this sh**.' She doesn’t say, 'I don't love you,' she says she doesn't need you.""  ""My own daughter has blocked me on Instagram,"" he adds. ""They grow up so quick.""  Now, the comedian says he's in the middle of ""starting over.""  ""Getting divorced, you have to f**king start over,"" he says. ""You get to reset. It's not a breakdown, but something in your life broke down.""  EXCLUSIVE: Kevin Hart Supports Chris Rock  Still, Rock has plenty of A-list friends to help him through. Last December, Amy Schumer Instagrammed a pic of her and Rock alongside Leslie Jones, Michael Che, Sam Morril and Colin Jost, the group enjoying themselves sitting courtside at a New York Knicks game.

Kanye West usually loves having all the attention on him, but sometimes he just doesn’t want his name in the midst of the madness.  The G.O.O.D music CEO is being used by a rapper trying to get his come-up by bashing Donald Trump and forging Kanye’s participation in his music. TMZ reports that King Myers dropped a track called “Propaganda” and put ‘Ye’s name on it as producer. He even used Kanye’s Twitter avatar as his cover art, leading people to believe that the famous rapper had some involvement.  However, Kanye’s team is speaking out about the fraudulent project, saying that West has nothing to do with it, and he’s already put his lawyers on the job to get his name and art removed from the track.  The news of a fake Trump diss by Kanye comes just after reports that ‘Ye deleted all of his pro-Trump tweets from Twitter. Maybe he and President Trump aren’t such long-time friends after all.  Did Kanye West Make A Diss Track About Donald Trump? was originally published on globalgrind.com	1
"CLOSE Actor Brian Dietzen weighs in on the impending departure of his ""NCIS"" co-star, popular actress Pauley Perrette. (Nov. 7) AP  Abby (Pauley Perrette) was seen hospitalized, and in imminent peril, after being shot in a street holdup in last week's 'NCIS' episode. (Photo: CBS)  Spoiler alert: If you haven't watched Tuesday's NCIS episode ""Two Steps Back,"" put your headphones on, crank up some Goth rock, refill your Caf-Pow cup and come back after you've seen it.  Leave it to NCIS forensics genius Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) to solve what first appeared to be her own murder.  Tuesday's ""Two Steps Back,"" which marked the final episode for Perrette after 15 seasons and more than 350 episodes, opened with Abby on the verge of death after a suffering a gunshot wound during a street holdup at the end of last week's episode.  Moments later, it appeared she was dead, as medical examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) approached a covered body on the exam table and spoke about performing an autopsy on a colleague.  But, in a big fakeout, it was Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry), the big-hearted NCIS colleague who was with Abby when she was robbed, who had been killed.  Investigate: The common thread connecting Pauley Perrette's favorite 'NCIS' episodes  More:Perrette says fans will need 'a couple boxes of tissues' for Abby's 'NCIS' exit  As team leader Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), special agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray) and Dr. Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) took turns standing vigil over a comatose Abby, her colleagues searched for the killer.  Blood found on Reeves led Gibbs and agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) to the home of the shooter. They found him murdered, along with evidence that he had been hired to kill Abby.  Since Abby's sleuthing skills had put so many bad guys away, there were many suspects to consider. The hit CBS drama took a trip down its own villainy lane, as agents interrogated embezzler Terry Spooner (from Season 3's ""Bloodbath,"" one of Perrette's favorite episodes) and Alejandro Rivera (seen in several episodes, starting with Season 10's ""Obsession""), a Mexican Justice Department official and brother of a drug lord.  NCIS team leader Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) stands over Abby's hospital bed during Tuesday's episode of 'NCIS.' (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  Finally, the agents tracked down their man, former Marine Corps Sgt. Major Robert King (Peter Jason), who had tricked Abby into developing a bioweapon until she stopped him in 2009's ""Toxic.""  In the meantime, Abby's healing abilities appeared to be even more amazing than her scientific skills: She was out of her coma and back in her cool, Goth-inspired apartment — the first time it had been seen on the show — before the fourth commercial break, ready to help the investigation.  Abby, now working from a computer in her kitchen, figured out that last week's mysterious restaurant invitation, which she shared with Reeves, was planned by her assailant. She tracked King's computer to a public wi-fi system, but pulled a fast one on Gibbs & Co., sending them to the wrong address.  In one of TV's longest-running cliches, which finds the hero refusing backup to face a killer alone, Abby — who had locked special agent Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) in her coffin — went to the real address and confronted King, who had put a hit on her after escaping prison. She told him she was tired of her heroes dying, listing former colleagues Caitlin Todd, Jenny Shepard, Ned Dorneget, Ziva David and Reeves, while villains survived.  A recuperating Abby (Pauley Perrette), left, wearing cool skull-and-crossbones pajamas, and NCIS agent Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) search for the man behind a colleague's death in Abby's very Abby-like apartment. (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  As King prepared to leave, Abby told him she put cyanide in his coffee, offering an antidote if he confessed. It wasn't exactly a move that would stand up in court, but it worked. (It also wasn't cyanide, as Abby gave King crushed Caf-Pow pills to trigger a caffeine jolt.) Gibbs and Torres arrested King.  Later, Abby returned to her lab and surprised her colleagues — minus Gibbs — with news that she was leaving NCIS immediately to oversee the charity that Reeves planned to start in honor of his late mother.  They reluctantly accepted her decision, although Palmer, speaking for his colleagues and many fans, said: ""The thought of you not being here, I just can't imagine it.""  ""You guys are my family and this is my home, but you have to go with your gut and my gut is telling me I have to go,"" she explained. (Perrette announced she was leaving in October.)  Tearful hugs followed, with especially long embraces for McGee and Ducky. She left the tiniest hint of a return but may have been humoring McGee when she said, ""It's not goodbye for good. It's goodbye for now.""  Abby (Pauley Perrette), facing the camera, shares a goodbye hug with NCIS agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) in Abby's and Perrette's final 'NCIS' episode. (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  The episode featured flashbacks focusing on the almost father-daughter bond between Gibbs and Abby, but Harmon and Perrette never appeared together in Abby's finale.  Gibbs was seen solo and from behind in Abby's hospital room, but never face to face , and Abby said a heartfelt goodbye via a letter left at his door. The NCIS leader eventually spotted her from his window standing across the street and the two shared virtual hugs and spoke in sign language as the camera cut back and forth between them. It was an odd and unsatisfying goodbye after such a long, deep relationship.  Abby ended the episode in her true NCIS home, her lab, packing up some dolls and leaving a copy of Abby's Lab for Dummies for the next forensics specialist. Those will be some huge boots to fill.

"Trey Songz can rest a little easier, as he apparently will not be facing felony prosecution for his alleged beating of Andrea Buera in a nightclub over NBA All-Star Weekend.  According to TMZ, the L.A. District attorney wasn't convinced about the validity of the case, leading to the felony charges being dropped against the singer.  Songz's lawyer reportedly presented several eye-witness statements that contradicted the statements given by Buera, as well as other info damaging to Buera's credibility.  The assault was first reported back in February, with Buera giving a press conference with her side of the story in early March, where she claimed that he beat her so badly that she had to be sent to the hospital. She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against Songz. Since then, Songz was forced to turn himself in to police, and was released from jail on a $50,000 bond. In his sole statement on the situation, Songz claimed that he was ""being lied on and falsely accused for someone's personal gain.""  Despite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a ""money play,"" Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women.  However, in this instance it appears he's gotten off easy. Songz still isn't off the hook yet, as his case is now being referred to the L.A. City Attorney, who can still charge him with the lesser crime of misdemeanor domestic violence.  We'll keep you up to date with any more news about the case."	0
"It’s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.  Though the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other’s lives, co-parenting their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 — together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.  Then on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.  “Ben’s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,” a source told ET. “He continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.”  Since their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.  Here’s everything she’s said about Affleck since their split:  July 2018  Garner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, “Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really — I could cry talking about it.”  She added, “What I think I’ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, ‘cause you think that’ll end the, ‘Are they engaged? Are they not?’ And that’s true in reverse, as well. If you are — if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there’s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, ‘Oh, you’ve had to go through this in public.’ The public isn’t what’s hard. What’s hard is going through it.”  June 2018  For Father’s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, “Our kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.”  November 2017  In an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, “I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”  May 2017  After People magazine released a cover story about Garner’s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.  “This isn’t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom’s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,"" she said. ""I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it’s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete.”  October 2016  Garner spoke with ET’s Denny Directo at the Save the Children Illumination Gala about how she and Affleck have chosen to raise their kids.  “It’s so important that you model for your kids how to be a citizen of the world, and I think that’s the best thing you can do,” she told ET, adding that she and Affleck each have special causes that they try to teach their kids about.  “That’s really important at home, to make sure that our kids know that we both have causes that we care so much about… that we dedicate time, resources, and our energy toward making our own little slice of the world a little bit better,” she said.  August 2016  'We are definitely a modern family': #JenniferGarner talks to @nmoralesnbc about family and marriage https://t.co/jJpZAE5BoG — TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 4, 2016  Garner was praised on the Today show for putting her kids first while dealing with the end of her marriage.  “It has to be,” she said. ""You don’t have a choice. It has to be.”  Calling their family unit “definitely a modern family,” she added, “We’re doing really well.”  She also opened up about her decision to take her kids to London for the filming of Justice League, in which Affleck played Batman.  “Ben was working on Justice League, and I thought, ‘Well, the kids should have that experience,'” she explained. “He and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.”"	1
Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.	1

"Chris Pratt And Zoe Saldana Break Silence On James Gunn's Firing From Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend The geek world was rocked late last week when it was announced that James Gunn had been fired from the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In the days since we have heard from a few members of the franchise family, including Dave Bautista, Sean Gunn, and Michael Rooker - but two key names we didn't hear from were Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. Now the two actors have broken their silence and posted mostly vague responses to the news on their respective social media channels: It’s been a challenging weekend I’m not gonna lie. I’m pausing myself to take everything in before I speak out of term. I just want everyone to know I love ALL members of my GOTG family. Always will. — Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) July 22, 2018 Without mentioning James Gunn by name, Zoe Saldana took to her personal Twitter account this afternoon to post a message about everything that has been happening. It seems that she is not yet ready to release a full comment on the situation, and instead simply stated that she loves ""ALL members of [the] GOTG family."" As for Chris Pratt's response to the James Gunn news, his message was even more cryptic. The actor, who saw his entire career change after being cast in Guardians of the Galaxy, chose a Bible verse as his means of communicating his thoughts - notably choosing a quotation from the Epistle of James in the New Testament: “Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters. Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.”    JAMES 1:19  ?????? — chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) July 22, 2018 Dave Bautista also noted in his statement that he would have more to say about this situation - and we can assume that this definitely won't be the last we here on the subject from Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. There are still some key members of the Guardians of the Galaxy cast who have not yet said anything publicly about James Gunn, including Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan and Pom Klementieff. Because all of them do press interviews throughout the year, we surely will hear something from them at least eventually. Right now, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 very much remains up in the air, with the project lacking a director - and it's unknown if Marvel Studios will still use the screenplay that Gunn has written for the trilogy capper. Production has been scheduled to start up in the early months of 2019, with the plan being to have the film in theaters some time in 2020. Neither Disney nor Marvel has officially commented on the status of the movie, or how/if it will be moving forward - but you can be sure that we will be keeping an eye out for updates, so stay tuned here on CinemaBlend."	0
"Caitlyn Jenner is giving the Kardashian family time to cool off after the release of her book, Secrets of My Life.    During her recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Kim Kardashian West admitted that she had not spoken to her former stepparent in several weeks because she felt there were things written about her mother, Kris Jenner, in the memoir that are ""so hurtful.""    WATCH: Caitlyn Jenner 'Ticked Off' at Kris Jenner, Claims She Didn't Get Any Money From KUWTK    On Australia's Today show on Thursday, Caitlyn opened up about being estranged from Kim and other members of the Kardashian family over what was said in her book. ""I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person, but, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down,"" she said. ""I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance.""  ""I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world,"" the 67-year-old reality star added. ""There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family. This is my book about my opinions on things that had happened with me and my family. Any time I express my opinion, you know, with my family, there's always challenges in doing that.""    WATCH: Caitlyn Jenner Says She Hasn't Been on a Date in 2 Years -- 'I Have Never Been Approached'    During a recent interview with Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM radio show, Caitlyn also claimed that she does not speak to Khloe Kardashian, though the two did recently appear in a scene together on Keeping Up With the Kardashians last month. ""She doesn't want to talk to me,"" she said of her former stepdaughter. ""She hasn't talked to me in, like, two years.""

"Sweeney Todd, see This article is about the film. For the song sometimes known as ""Pretty Woman"", see Oh, Pretty Woman . For the song in the musical, see Pretty Women  Not to be confused with Pretty Lady (disambiguation)  Pretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features Hector Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles.[1] The film's story centers on down-on-her-luck Hollywood prostitute Vivian Ward, who is hired by Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of her week-long stay with him.  Originally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and sex work in Los Angeles, the film was reconceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. It was widely successful at the box office and was the third highest-grossing film of 1990. The film saw the highest number of ticket sales in the U.S. ever for a romantic comedy,[2] with Box Office Mojo listing it as the #1 romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets.[3] The film received positive reviews, with Roberts's performance being praised, for which she received a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition, screenwriter J. F. Lawton was nominated for a Writers Guild Award and a BAFTA Award.  Plot [ edit ]  High-powered businessman Edward Lewis has broken up with his girlfriend after an unpleasant phone call wherein he asked her to escort him during his business trip - she is offended that he treats her as his ""beck and call girl"". Edward is a corporate raider, who buys companies that are in financial trouble and tears down the company piece by piece. Leaving a business party in the Hollywood Hills, he takes his lawyer's Lotus Esprit sports car, and accidentally ends up on Hollywood Boulevard in the city's red-light district, where he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. Having difficulties driving the car, he asks her to get in and guide him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where he is staying. It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive. Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate. She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; later, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3,000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as paying for a new, more acceptable wardrobe for her. That evening, visibly moved by her transformation, Edward begins seeing Vivian in a different light. He begins to open up to her, revealing his personal and business lives.  Edward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal. His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met. Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished. Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement. Edward apologizes, and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate to whom Vivian paid attention at the match. Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways. Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see La Traviata at the San Francisco Opera. Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man. Vivian breaks her ""no kissing on the mouth"" rule (which her friend Kit taught her) and they have sex; in the aftermath, Vivian tells Edward she loves him, but he does not respond. Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets. Hurt, she refuses, says this is not the ""fairy tale"" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.  Meeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of ""raiding,"" Edward changes his mind. His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests working together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces. Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, wrestles Philip off her, punches him in the face and throws him out of the room.  With his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him, but because she wants to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. Edward re-thinks his life and has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from out the white limousine's sun roof and ""rescues her."" Edward asks, ""So what happens after he climbed up the tower and rescues her?"" to which Vivian responds, ""She rescues him right back.""  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  The film was initially conceived as a dark drama about sex work in Los Angeles in the 1980s.[4] The relationship between Vivian and Edward also originally involved controversial themes, including Vivian being addicted to drugs; part of the deal was that she had to stay off cocaine for a week. Edward eventually throws her out of his car and drives off. The original script by J.F. Lawton, called 3000,[5] ended with Vivian and her sex-worker friend on the bus to Disneyland.[4] Producer Laura Ziskin considered these elements detrimental to a sympathetic portrayal of Vivian, and they were removed or assigned to Kit. The deleted scenes have been found, and some were included on the DVD released for the film's 15th anniversary.[4] In one, Vivian tells Edward, ""I could just pop ya good and be on my way"", indicating her disinterest in ""pillow talk"". In another, she is confronted by drug dealers, then rescued by Edward.  Though inspired by such films as Wall Street and The Last Detail,[5] the film bears a resemblance to Pygmalion myths: particularly George Bernard Shaw's play of the same name, which also formed the basis for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It was Walt Disney Studios then-president Jeffrey Katzenberg who insisted the film be re-written as a modern-day fairy tale and love story, as opposed to the original dark drama. It was pitched to Touchstone Pictures and re-written as a romantic comedy.[6] The title 3000 was changed because Disney executives thought it sounded like a title for a science fiction film.[7]  The film is one of two movies that triggered a resurgence of romantic comedy in Hollywood, the other being When Harry Met Sally. Following this film's success, Roberts became the romantic comedy queen of the 1990s.  Casting [ edit ]  Casting of the film was a rather lengthy process. Marshall had initially considered Christopher Reeve, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Denzel Washington for the role of Edward, and Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds turned it down.[8] Pacino went as far as doing a casting reading with Roberts before rejecting the part.[9] Gere initially refused but when he met with Roberts, she persuaded him and he eventually agreed to play Lewis.[10] He reportedly started off much more active in his role; but Garry Marshall took him aside and said ""No, no, no, Richard. In this movie, one of you moves and one of you does not. Guess which one you are?""[11] Julia Roberts was not the first choice for the role of Vivian, and was not wanted by Disney. Many other actresses were considered. Marshall originally envisioned Karen Allen for the role; when she declined, auditions went to many better-known actresses of the time including Molly Ringwald,[12] who turned it down because she felt uncomfortable playing a sex worker.[citation needed] Winona Ryder auditioned, but was turned down because Marshall felt she was ""too young"". Jennifer Connelly was also dismissed for the same reason.[4]  Meg Ryan, who was a top choice of Marshall's, turned it down as well. According to a note written by Marshall, Mary Steenburgen was also among the first choices. Diane Lane came very close to being cast (the script was much darker at the time); they had gone as far as costume fittings, but due to scheduling conflicts she could not accept. Michelle Pfeiffer turned the role down, saying she did not like the script's ""tone.""[13] Daryl Hannah was also considered, but believed the role was ""degrading to women"".[13] Valeria Golino declined, doubting it would work with her thick Italian accent.[citation needed] And Jennifer Jason Leigh had auditioned.[14] When all the other actresses turned down the role, 21-year-old Julia Roberts, a relative unknown, with only the sleeper hit Mystic Pizza (1988) and the yet-to-be-released Steel Magnolias (1989) to her credit, won the role of Vivian. Her performance made her a star. J.F. Lawton, writer of the original screenplay, has suggested that the film was ultimately given a happy ending because of the chemistry of Gere and Roberts.[5]  Veteran actor Ralph Bellamy, who plays James Morse, appears in his final acting performance before his death in 1991.  Filming [ edit ]  The film's budget was substantial, at $14 million, so producers could shoot in many locations.[4] Most filming took place in Los Angeles, California, specifically in Beverly Hills, and inside soundstages at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The escargot restaurant the ""Voltaire"" was shot at the restaurant ""Rex,"" now called ""Cicada"". Scenes set in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lobby were shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Filming commenced on July 24, 1989, but was immediately plagued by problems. These included Ferrari and Porsche declining the product placement opportunity for the car Edward drove, neither firm wishing to be associated with sex workers.[4] Lotus Cars saw the placement value, and supplied a Silver 1989.5 Esprit SE (which was later sold).[15]  Shooting was a generally pleasant, easy-going experience, as the budget was broad and the shooting schedule was not tight.[4] While shooting the scene where Vivian is lying down on the floor of Edward's penthouse, watching reruns of I Love Lucy, Garry Marshall had to tickle Roberts' feet (out of camera range) to get her to laugh. The scene in which Gere playfully snaps the lid of a jewelry case on her fingers was improvised, and her surprised laugh was genuine. The red dress Vivian wears to the opera has been listed among the most unforgettable dresses of all time.[16]  During the scene in which Roberts sang to a Prince song in the bathtub, slid down and submerged her head under the bubbles; she emerged to find the crew had left except for the cameraman, who captured the moment on film. In the love scene, she was so stressed that a vein become noticeable on her forehead and had to be massaged by Marshall and Gere. She also developed a case of hives, and calamine lotion was used to soothe her skin until filming resumed.[4] The filming was completed on October 18.  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  In its opening weekend, the film was at number one at the box office, grossing $11,280,591 and averaging $8,513 per theater.[17] Despite dropping to number two in its second weekend, it grossed more with $12,471,670.[17] It was number one at the box office for four non-consecutive weeks, and in the Top 10 for 16 weeks.[17] It has grossed $178,406,268 in the United States and $285,000,000 in other countries for a total worldwide gross of $463,406,268.[18] It was also the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in the United States[19] and the third highest-grossing worldwide.[20] The film remains Disney's highest-grossing R-rated release ever.[21]  Critical response [ edit ]  The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 61% of 57 film critics have given it a positive review, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10. The site's consensus states, ""Pretty Woman may be a yuppie fantasy, but the film's slick comedy, soundtrack, and casting can overcome misgivings.""[22] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives it a score of 51 based on 17 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews.""[23]  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D, saying it ""starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy"" and with ""its tough-hooker heroine, it can work as a feminist version of an upscale princess fantasy."" Gleiberman also said it ""pretends to be about how love transcends money,"" but ""is really obsessed with status symbols.""[24] On its twentieth anniversary, Gleiberman wrote another article, saying that while he felt he was right, he would have given it a B today.[25] Carina Chocano of The New York Times said the movie ""wasn't a love story, it was a money story. Its logic depended on a disconnect between character and narrative, between image and meaning, between money and value, and that made it not cluelessly traditional but thoroughly postmodern.""[26]  Accolades [ edit ]  Awards  Nominations  Music [ edit ]  The film is noted for its musical selections. The hugely successful soundtrack features the song ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" by Roy Orbison, which inspired its title. Roxette's ""It Must Have Been Love"" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1990. The soundtrack also features ""King of Wishful Thinking"" by Go West, ""Show Me Your Soul"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""No Explanation"" by Peter Cetera, ""Wild Women Do"" by Natalie Cole and ""Fallen"" by Lauren Wood. The soundtrack went on to be certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[27]  The opera featured in the film is La Traviata, which also served as inspiration for its plot. The highly dramatic aria fragment that is repeated is the end of ""Dammi tu forza!"" (""Give me strength!""), from the opera. The piano piece Gere's character plays in the hotel lobby was actually composed by and performed by him. Roberts sings the song ""Kiss"" by Prince while she is in the tub and Gere's character is on the phone. Background music is composed by James Newton Howard. Entitled ""He Sleeps/Love Theme"", this piano composition is inspired by Bruce Springsteen's ""Racing in the Street"".

"This article is about the American actor. For the Australian boxer, see Brad Pitt (boxer)  William Bradley ""Brad"" Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer. He has received multiple awards and nominations including an Academy Award as producer under his own company Plan B Entertainment.  Pitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the road movie Thelma & Louise (1991). His first leading roles in big-budget productions came with the drama films A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994), and horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994). He gave critically acclaimed performances in the crime thriller Seven and the science fiction film 12 Monkeys (both 1995), the latter earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination.  Pitt starred in the cult film Fight Club (1999) and the heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). His greatest commercial successes have been Troy (2004), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), and World War Z (2013). Pitt received his second and third Academy Award nominations for his leading performances in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). He produced The Departed (2006) and 12 Years a Slave (2013), both of which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and also The Tree of Life, Moneyball, and The Big Short (2015), all of which garnered Best Picture nominations.  As a public figure, Pitt has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, he was cited as the world's most attractive man by various media outlets, and his personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actress Jennifer Aniston after five years of marriage, he married actress Angelina Jolie in 2014. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. In 2016, Jolie filed for a divorce from Pitt, which is currently pending.[2]  Early life  William Bradley Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, who ran a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counsellor.[3][4] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969).[5] Born into a conservative household,[6] he was raised as Southern Baptist, but has since stated that he does not ""have a great relationship with religion"" and that he ""oscillate[s] between agnosticism and atheism"".[7] Pitt has described Springfield as ""Mark Twain country, Jesse James country"", having grown up with ""a lot of hills, a lot of lakes"".[8]  Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams.[9] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[10] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[10] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—""a portal into different worlds for me""—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[11][12] Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[11] He has named his early acting heroes as Gary Oldman, Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke.[13]  Career  1987–1993: Early work  While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[10][14] Pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less Than Zero (1987).[10][15] In May 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[16] In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[17] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall).[18] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[19] In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[10] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[17] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[20]  Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder.[21] Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: ""Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary.""[21] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image.[22] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.[23] After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[22] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[17][24] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[25] and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World,[17] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[26][27]  Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[28] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[29] proving that Pitt could be more than a ""cowboy-hatted hunk.""[30] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[5] and thought it one of his ""weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.""[5] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying ""when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.""[29][30] In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as ""outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.""[31] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film.[32] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[33]  1994–1998: Breakthrough  1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name,[34] he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[34] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[35] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, ""Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.""[36] Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[37] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[38] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[39] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[40] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, ""Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way.""[41] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[42]  In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer.[43] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[44] He expressed his intent to move on from ""this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws.""[45] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a ""determined, energetic, creditable job"" as the detective.[46] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[26] Following the success of Seven, Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science-fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of the New York Times called Twelve Monkeys ""fierce and disturbing"" and remarked on Pitt's ""startlingly frenzied performance"", concluding that he ""electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film.""[47] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[39] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[48]  The following year he had a role in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[49] The film received mixed reviews.[50] In the 1997 film The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as the Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[51] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[52] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; ""Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying"", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[53] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[54] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide,[26] but was a critical failure. Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[55] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[56] The film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment.[57] Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[58] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to ""make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity.""[59] Roger Ebert stated ""Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.""[60]  1999–2003  In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[61][62] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[63] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[64] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[65] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to ""have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.""[66] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[67] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[68][69] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[70] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be ""cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise"".[71] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[72]  Pitt in December 2001  Pitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[73] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[74] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was ""ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him"", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been ""shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;""[75] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that ""Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role"".[76] The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[77] a film that garnered a range of reviews[78] but enjoyed box office success.[26] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[26] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[79] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided ""much of an emotional connection for the audience"".[80]  On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[81] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[82] In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts.[83] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[26] Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[84] and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode.[85] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[86] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[87] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[88]  2004–2013  Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[89] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[90] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Times stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[91] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[92] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[26] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as ""the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.""[93] In 2005, Pitt starred in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that ""while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry"".[94] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[95]  Burn After Reading premiere in August 2008 Pitt at thepremiere in August 2008  For his next film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006).[96] Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that he was credible and gave the film visibility.[97] Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career.[98] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[99] and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[100] Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.[39] That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[109] with Pitt's ""sensitive"" performance making Benjamin Button a ""timeless masterpiece"", according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[110] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[111] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[39][112] all in the category for Best Actor.

""We have to make sure that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find"", he said.[150] In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.[151]  Pitt at the ""Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict"", June 2014  Pitt supports the ONE Campaign, an organization aimed at combating AIDS and poverty in the developing world.[152][153] He narrated the 2005 PBS public television series Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge, which discusses current global health issues.[154] The following year Pitt and Jolie flew to Haiti, where they visited a school supported by Yéle Haïti, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician Wyclef Jean.[155] In May 2007, Pitt and Jolie donated $1 million to three organizations in Chad and Sudan dedicated to those affected by the crisis in the Darfur region.[156] Along with Clooney, Damon, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, Pitt is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch, an organization that focuses global attention on stopping ""mass atrocities"".[157]  Pitt has a sustained interest in architecture,[158] even taking time away from film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry.[159] He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design.[160] In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson.[161] In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150 sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.[162][163]  The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services.[164][165] Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5 million in donations.[166] The first six homes were completed in October 2008,[167] and in September 2009 Pitt received an award in recognition of the project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated.[168][169] Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.[170]  In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie established a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world.[171] The foundation made initial donations of $1 million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders,[172] followed by an October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created in memory of the late American journalist Daniel Pearl.[173] According to federal filings, Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5 million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4 million in 2006[174] and $3.4 million in 2007.[175] In June 2009 the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1 million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and Taliban militants.[176] In January 2010 the foundation donated $1 million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.[177][178]  Pitt is a supporter of same-sex marriage.[179] In an October 2006 interview with Esquire, Pitt said that he would marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry.[180] In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative to overturn the state Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage.[181] In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8' — a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage — as Judge Vaughn Walker.[182]  In September 2012, Pitt reaffirmed his support of President Obama, saying, ""I am an Obama supporter and I'm backing his US election campaign.""[183]  Personal life  Relationships  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pitt was involved in successive relationships with several of his co-stars, including Robin Givens (Head of the Class),[184] Jill Schoelen (Cutting Class),[184] and Juliette Lewis (Too Young to Die? and Kalifornia).[29] In addition, Pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his Seven co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.[184]  Pitt met Friends actress Jennifer Aniston in 1998 and married her in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000.[185] In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they had decided to separate. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[186] Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005.[186] Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston ""check in with each other"", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.[187]  During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. Jolie stated that there was no infidelity,[188] and Pitt and Jolie stated that they ""fell in love"" on the set.[188][189] In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. During 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple ""Brangelina"".[190] On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time. Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together.[191] They were married on August 23, 2014, in a private ceremony in Château Miraval, France.[192] On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.[2]  Children  In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, Zahara Marley.[193][194] On December 3, 2005, Pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of Zahara, and Jolie's first adopted child, Maddox Chivan.[195] On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie's request to change the children's surnames from ""Jolie"" to ""Jolie-Pitt"".[196] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[197]  Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh Nouvel in Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would qualify for a Namibian passport.[198] The couple sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images; the North American rights were purchased by People for over $4.1 million, while Hello! obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children.[199] Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a wax figure of two-month-old Shiloh; it marked the first time an infant was recreated in wax by Madame Tussauds.[200]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted three-year-old Pax Thien from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[201] Pitt adopted Pax in the United States on February 21, 2008.[202]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins.[203] She gave birth to son Knox Léon and daughter Vivienne Marcheline on July 12, 2008 in Nice, France.[204] The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken.[205][206] The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205][207]  In the media  Pitt's perceived sex appeal has been picked up by many sources, including Empire, who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995.[10][208][209] The same year, Pitt won People's Sexiest Man Alive, an accolade he won again in 2000.[208][210] Pitt appeared on Forbes's annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2006, 2007, and 2008, at No. 20, No. 5, and No. 10 respectively.[211][212][213] In 2007, he was listed among the Time 100, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by TIME.[214] The magazine credited Pitt with using ""his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch"".[214] Pitt was again included in the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the Builders and Titans list.[215]  Starting in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. After confirming that Jolie was pregnant in early 2006, the significant media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled ""The Brangelina fever,"" called ""the point of insanity"".[216] To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter Shiloh, which was described by a paparazzi blog as ""the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ.""[217] Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement two years later of Jolie's second pregnancy; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.[218]  In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[219] Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.[220] Other commercial appearances came in television spots including Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model Tatiana Sorokko,[221] as well as SoftBank, and Edwin Jeans.[222] On June 2, 2015, the minor planet 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.[223]  Filmography  Selected notable roles:  Awards and nominations  See also"	1

Lourd, 25, explained that she took the trip Fisher never did and posted pictures of her and her step father Bruce Bozzi.  “We journeyed to northern Norway to see if we might ‘see the heavens lift up her dark skirts and flash her dazzling privates across [our] unworthy irises’. And she did.”  “I love you times infinity,” Lourd concluded.  In September, she told Ellen DeGeneres that life has been “surreal” since the loss of her mother and grandmother Debbie Reynolds, who died one day later.  “There’s no way to really explain it, and it’s so hard to talk about,” she said. “If I say that I’m doing good, I’m too happy, and if I say that I’m not doing good, then I’m a mess, so it’s really hard to know what to say about it because it really is so surreal and impossible to deal with.”  Mark Hamill also paid his respects to his longtime friend and “Star Wars” co-star via social media on Wednesday.  “No one’s ever really gone…” he posted along with photos of the two of them.	0
Taylor Swift laid low once again this Fourth of July, spending the holiday with her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.  Swift decided to forgo her once-beloved Independence Day party for the second year in a row, instead celebrating America's 242nd birthday by splashing around in the ocean with her British beau.  The 28-year-old Reputation artist still managed to show her patriotic side in a red, white, and blue stripped two-piece bikini while swimming and snorkeling with the 27-year-old actor.  The pair enjoyed the temperate climate and calm waters at a luxury resort in Turks and Caicos, where they made the most of their romantic vacation. They even got a little cozy in the surf as Swift rode on Alwyn's back through the idyllic blue waters.  SBMF / BACKGRID  The pair's cozy ocean romp was a rare public outing for the couple. Despite being romantically linked since last May, they've only been spotted out and about together a handful of times.  While the lovebirds enjoyed the quiet, romantic holiday in relative privacy, fans of the pop icon were left wondering if this marked the end of Swift's Fourth of July party tradition.  For years now, the singer and her squad of besties -- which included super models, singers, actress and social media stars -- all gathered at Swift's Rhode Island estate for FOMO-inducing festivities that included barbecues, fireworks, patriotic inflatable bouncy houses and more.  However, amid her prolonged break from the public eye in the months before Reputation's release in November -- as well as her highly publicized feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and taking heat for not being as vocal against President Donald Trump as some fans would have liked -- Swift also skipped last year's Fourth of July celebration.  As some fans have suggested, it's possible Swift -- like many celebrities -- simply hasn't felt like celebrating the patriotic holiday. Or maybe its because she has been gearing up for and then subsequently performing in her massive Reputation Stadium Tour, and simply hasn't had time or energy to throw together a massive party. Only Swift herself can answer those questions.  For more on Swift's epic Fourth of July celebrations of years' past, check out the video below.

Artist, DJ, and producer Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, died Friday afternoon in Oman, according to a statement from his rep. He was 28.  “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” the statement reads. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”  One of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time — he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with “Wake Me Up” and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes’ “Highest-Paid DJs” lists — he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons. He had suffered from health problems for several years, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.  He posted the following statement on his website last year:  “WE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US.  For me it’s creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.  Related Celebrities Who Died in 2018  Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music. Instead, I went back to the place where it all made sense – the studio.  The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new.  Hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.”  Bergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit “Seek Bromance,” which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as “the lowest level of Buddhist hell,” chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.  His 2011 single “Levels,” which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. “Sunshine,” his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York’s prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled “Stay with You.”  His proper debut album, “True,” was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.’s fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album “Rebel Heart,” although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.  The extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 “Saturday Night Live” digital short called “When Will the Bass Drop?,” with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named “Davvincii” (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).  However, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem “We Will Find a Way.” Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay’s album “Ghost Stories.” He released his second full-length album, “Stories,” in October 2015.  In March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.  In August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled “Avici,” which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called “True Stories,” which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he’s in obvious physical pain. “I looked at myself like, ‘F—, you should’ve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'” he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. “Why didn’t I stop the ship earlier?”  “I needed to figure out my life,” he continued. “The whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn’t getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible. That’s what I love the most – having a session with Nile Rodgers, for instance, and getting an understanding of music that’s invaluable.”  RELATED CONTENT  Musicians, Celebrities Pay Tribute to Avicii  Avicii’s Biggest Hits (Listen)  ‘Avicii: True Stories’ Documentary Reveals Star DJ’s Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement  Avicii’s Life and Career in Photos  POPULAR ON VARIETY	0

"Applicants during ABC's ""The Bachelor"" casting call at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface.  Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for.  As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr.  Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days.  Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley.  While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love.  Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show.  What's in an application  Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic)  I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey.  Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number.  I was No. 72.  A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons.  Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that.  The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in.  I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard.  Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss.  Angelie Meehan, of Phoenix, wears a cow costume to her audition for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. She said she was looking for ""that special bull for her life."" (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  I was half expecting someone to start handing out champagne and offer lines of encouragement, something like, ""Are you ready for your journey to begin?""  We took our seats and began filling out a six-page-long application that delved into my dating history, employment and why I was looking for love on a reality TV show.  The application offered some interesting questions, such as:  What accomplishments are you most proud of?  Are you genuinely looking to get married and why?  What have you not found yet but would like in a relationship?  There were also several questions on prior relationships and marriages. The application explicitly asked if we drank alcohol, only to follow up with the next logical question: What's your favorite drink?  My newfound friend had issues with some of the questions, like what our salary was and what was on our bucket list. We both skipped the question asking if we had any interesting talents.  The application was coupled with an intense release to agree to everything the producers may do if you get picked for the show. It felt like we were signing our life away, a thought that resonated with many of the applicants sitting around us.  All in the name of love, though.  Interestingly enough, most people I spoke with who were auditioning had not watched the show before. It seemed strange to me to audition for a process they had never seen on TV before. This would be like someone trying out for ""Survivor"" not knowing you will be trapped on a deserted island.  To make it on the show, you must be 21 or older, be single and can't have been convicted of a felony. You also can't be running for any type of political office.  A quiet room, a video recording  Women line up to fill out their audition sheets during a casting call for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  After quite a bit of sitting and waiting, we stood in another line, had a few photos snapped and then were shuffled from the grand ballroom into smaller conference rooms, greeted by a small camcorder and an interviewer.  We sat as a small group outside, waiting for our names to be called. I made a new friend, who told me she reluctantly agreed to audition after a friend worried about her love life drove her to the resort. She said her friend even tweeted photos to the producers of the show to get their attention.  The empty room was daunting, but the woman behind the camera was kind. She'd been through her fair share of casting calls before and seemed to know all the right questions to ask to make me feel comfortable about divulging my personal life to a lens.  ""You were great!"" she said. Click.  I wondered if she said that to everyone or if she really meant it.  The questions were as basic as the rest of the process: talk about your family, where you grew up and your dating history. The video was the most personal part of the process, though it only lasted for about five minutes. The tapes get whisked off to Los Angeles to be viewed by show producers for the next month and a half.  I'm not holding my breath.  While I truly had no intentions of getting picked for the show, I did complete the application process honestly.  Most interestingly, almost none of the crew worked for ABC or ""The Bachelor"" directly. A few producers were roaming around, someone told me, but most were kept hidden behind closed doors. There was some secrecy to the whole process, as some girls were taken aside for private interviews and on special photo shoots.  Will any of them make it on the next season?  Stay tuned.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Sharing her story on the Grammy winner’s new The Swift Life app, the fan named Stephanie prefaced her post by saying she had contemplated whether or not to post about her experience.  “I’ve finally decided to tell you all what Taylor did for me this night,” wrote Stephanie, who accompanied her post with photos of herself backstage with Swift, 28, at her 1989 tour, her house and baby girl. “What many of you don’t know is that for eight months of my pregnancy I was homeless.”  Stephanie and Taylor Swift The Swift Life  “Long story short our first flat was condemned for health and safety reasons and we lost everything. To add to the stress, during this time [my partner] Matthew lost his job.”  While attending Swift’s concert in Manchester, Stephanie says her mother filled in the “End Game” singer about her daughter’s difficult situation and simply asked the star to make her “feel special” that night.  The Swift Life  “After the show Taylor took us back to her dressing room where she told me, ‘Stephanie, You’ve been in my life for a long time and you’ve never asked me for anything. You could have reached out and I would have helped you. But you didn’t. [Your] mum told me..”  Swift told Stephanie she was going to give her money for her concert ticket but ended up helping “us buy a home and all I needed for my baby,” she continued.

"“ If you put us in the arena, I won't be losing a daughter. Gaia will win. I will have her take my life - right after I take your brother's. ” — Indra to Octavia  The Warriors Will is the tenth episode of the fifth season of The 100. It is the sixty-eighth episode of the series overall.  Monty strives to show Wonkru an alternative to war, and to the valley itself. Meanwhile, Abby's health continues to deteriorate, along with McCreary's patience.[1]  Contents show]  Plot Edit  Octavia is contemplating her next move when Miller and Brell bring bad news that there are now divisions among Wonkru. Some of them want to follow the real commander, Madi. Brell suggests that the only way to unite Wonkru behind Blodreina is to remind them the rule - that anyone against Wonkru is an enemy of Wonkru. That means, she should put the traitors - Bellamy, Indra and Gaia - to fight to the death in the pit. She would then use fear to make Wonkru follow her.  While the plan might work, Octavia is worried that Bellamy might die. She still cares deeply about him. So, she goes to Indra to look for ideas on a different strategy. She brings up how Indra accepted her and trained her as her second when her own people didn't believe in her. She gets teary as she wonders why Indra would betray her. Indra doesn't have a way for Octavia out of this. She warns Octavia that she plans to kill Bellamy and let Gaia kill her. That way, she doesn't lose a daughter. This gets Octavia even more worried. Since she knows Indra's weaknesses, she asks Monty to go tell Bellamy to help him win. But Monty refuses and asks Octavia to face Bellamy herself. Monty then shows Octavia that he's been able to revive the hydrofarm and it's just a matter of time before the ground above is ready for growing crops as well. So, there is no need to fight for the valley. He shows Octavia an apple blossom flower that he had been able to grow... but Octavia plucks it and walks out, angrily.  Octavia is left with no choice but to go talk to Bellamy herself. She starts by reminding him of how he used to protect her when she was a kid. She wonders why he's changed so much that he would poison her. Bellamy insists that he hasn't changed. He only did it to protect her. She's the one who changed by becoming Blodreina. Octavia tries to help him win the fight by telling him Indra's weakness - Indra's shoulder is still weak since she was shot by Pike years ago. She asks Bellamy to take advantage of that and kill Indra during the fight to the death. Bellamy refuses and insists that he won't fight. He asks Octavia to call off the fight instead if she really wants to save him. Octavia replies ""Will see"" and walks out. She starts crying. She then slits her wrists and paints her face with the blood, ready for the fight.  Before the fight in the arena, Bellamy wants to convince Indra and Gaia that they should all refuse to fight to see if Octavia would actually execute them herself. Indra admits that Octavia might not kill her or Bellamy but she would kill Gaia. So, Indra concludes that she must kill Bellamy to save her daughter. She promises to make it quick. She then strategizes with Gaia on how to fake a convincing fight before killing her. Gaia insists that all she cares about is to keep Madi safe... and that means killing Octavia. But Indra advises her against it because Octavia's guards would kill her right away. Octavia announces the start of the fight. After fighting for a couple minutes, Gaia is knocked down, but after regaining consciousness, she throws a spear aimed at Octavia. Luckily, it misses Octavia. Instead of retaliating, Octavia orders her guards to stand down; and instead throws the spear back on the floor and asks Gaia to continue fighting.  Suddenly, Monty and Harper interrupt the fight. They are carrying flowers from the hydrofarm. They reveal to everyone that the hydrofarm can now be used to grow food; and that Octavia knew about it, too. This makes Octavia lose credibility among Wonkru. Everyone starts going against her, marking the end of the fight. In retaliation, Octavia heads straight to the hydrofarm and burns it down, leaving them with no choice but to follow her to fight for the valley.  Disheartened, Octavia packs her things and starts walking towards the valley. Miller follows and invites anyone else who would like to join them. Since they have no choice, they all follow Octavia as they march towards the valley.  Meanwhile at the valley, McCreary takes away Abby's drugs until she agrees to treat him. So, Abby uses Vinson to bring the drugs to her by pretending that he's coming for a medical check up. Unfortunately, Vinson gets busted by McCreary's guards. They attack him and he starts biting them. Abby uses the opportunity to get her hands on the drugs.  On their way to the valley, Madi insists that she wants to go back to the bunker to help her people but Clarke forces her to stay in the rover. They find that Octavia had kept the worms inside a bottle in the trunk. Clarke drops the bottle, releasing the worms onto the ground. Madi then starts getting scary memory flashes of the commanders before her - including Lexa and even Becca - because of the flame. When she mentions her plans to remove the flame, Madi asks her to destroy it because otherwise she will put it back in. However, when Madi goes to sleep, Clarke is unable to remove the flame after noticing Madi crying. Clarke tells Madi that she thinks of her as her child and she doesn't want to see her die young and horribly like the other commanders.  Upon arriving at the valley, Clarke and Madi are shocked to see McCreary's people killing the defectors. When one of the prisoners is left to bury the dead, Madi and Clarke approach him and force him to tell them what's going on. He explains that McCreary is in charge now and that Diyoza is in hiding. They ask where to find Abby. After that, Madi kills him immediately. Clarke and Madi head to the gas station medical room. They find Abby lying on the floor, unconscious, due to overdosing.

People that knew him really well say they see him in me, that it’s almost scary.”  Her older brother, Prince Michael Jackson, agrees.  “Basically, as a person, she is who my dad is.

First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.	1
Gwyneth Paltrow is edgy. She really, really is.  Not convinced? Every year, the actress packs her holiday gift guide with suggestions that are sure to raise eyebrows, from kinky lingerie and sex toys to genitalia grooming kits to drug paraphernalia — but for 2017 she's managed to outdo herself.  A section of the Goop gift guide for 'lovers,' in particular, really pushes the limits this year, recommending everything from sex toys — 12, to be exact — to pricey lingerie to a pen that delivers THC to the body right before sex.  'Tis the season! Gwyneth Paltrow's website Goop has released its 2017 holiday gift guide  The gold standard in orgasms! In a section for 'lovers,' the site suggests five different vibrators, including two plated with precious metals  When tickling is out of touch: There's also this feather ring for 'tickling' in the bedroom, which costs a jaw-dropping $673  That's a pricey rub: Most of the section is packed with lingerie and sex toys, like this massage ring for $795  That price will certainly make a girl clench! A vocal promoter of vaginal maintenance, Gwyneth recommends $885 benwa balls, which are used to strengthen pelvic muscles  Naturally, the gift guide is full of items so pricey that the general public might be surprised that anyone would ever spend that much.  The 'lovers' section is no exception to the high price point, and includes a $425 silky PJ set, a $595 lace kimono, a $168 lace bra, and lots of expensive jewelry.  But the most shocking items don't have just big price tags to set them apart. This year, Goop is recommending five different vibrators, including the $99 Crave bullet with 24k gold plating, the $149 Crave Vesper vibrator necklace (also gold-plated), and a $169 Lelo Tiani 3.  Then there are the toys that don't buzz — but, despite a lack of mechanics, are still seriously expensive.  Suggested are the $673 Betony Vernon Marabou Pleasure Puff Ring, which 'works overtime as a playful tickler in the bedroom'.  The same brand has a double sterling-silver massage ring for $795, which looks like two simple metallic balls, as well as a set of $885 benwa balls, which women can carry around in their vaginas to strengthen pelvic muscles.  So kinky! She also suggests this BDSM-inspired piece of jewelry, which costs $1,505  Hurt me like my credit card statement! These leather tools for spanking and whipping cost hundreds of dollars  A true artist: This body-painting kit costs only $70 and comes with pain, disposable slippers, and a body scrubber for cleanup  For the budget fetishist: Less pricey are the pubic hair oil for $44 and $18 sexy bubble bath  There's also a 'Sado-Chic' piece of jewelry with a choker necklace and cuff bracelet, which are held together by a chain and clearly meant to be used in BDSM play. It costs $1,505.  Shoppers who want to shell out on leather goods for the bedroom have Gwyneth-approved options, too, including a $295 whip and a $195 paddle by Kiki de Montparnasse.  'Covered in supple textured lambskin leather, it makes for some utterly pleasurable chastising — light lashing, soft spanking — behind closed doors,' reads the Goop description of the paddle, which fails to mention that the human hand can do something quite similar and doesn't cost a thing.  And for those seeking a more experiential gift as opposed to something more materialistic, they need look no further than 'The Wild Woman's Way' tantra workshop — a steal at $450.  Luckily, there are a few budget-friendly options for Gwyneth's more cash-strapped but kinky admirers, though those are mostly of the bath and beauty variety. Try $44 'fur oil' for public hairs, $18 'Get it On' body wash by PLANT Apothecary, and a $70 Love is Art x goop 'couple's paint kit' for — ahem — sensual body-painting.  'The key to this body-painting kit — by which we mean painting a canvas using your and your partner’s bodies — is stripping down first,' the website explains.'  Puff puff pump: The list includes these THC inhalers which come in varieties like 'passion' for using before sex  It's legal in Califonria! The list includes a joint storage case and a pipe  Super strength! This $199 Elvie Trainer is meant to help the user strengthen the pelvic floor.  Perhaps the most unique item, however, is the HMBLDT Passion Dose Pen for $40 and up. The pen delivers a THC-dominant formula to give a 'euphoric feeling' to 'increase sensuality and heighten your sexual experience'.  In fact, the 'lovers' category isn't the only one in which Goop recommends products related to cannabis or sex.  For 'dreamers,' the site offers a $45 JvdF 'joint case,' the right shape and size to git two marijuana joints — though Goop explains: 'It works great for storing any teeny essentials—jewelry, Advil, you name it.'  There is also a ceramic pipe under the Stocking Stuffers category.  For 'health nuts,' there's a $199 Elvie Trainer, which is slipped into the vagina like a tampon and controlled via Bluetooth. It is meant to help the user strengthen the pelvic floor.  Of course, not everything on the list is rated PG-13 — but even the G-rated items can cost a few Gs.  Just expensive: The guide has a $130 match holder (left) and a $345 incense burner (right)  What does the fox say? (It says pricey!) For kids, this mask costs a whopping $52  Several of the gifts just seem extravagant for what they are, like a $125 bookmark (left) and a $181 diffuser (right)  Generous! This casserole dish will set a gift-giver back $1,220  Some of the most outrageous gifts for a host or hostess are a $100 RBT decanter, a $181 Addition Studio essential oil burner, and an $85 FS Objects bottle opener.

It’s time to uncork the bubbly! Jedediah Bila and her fiancé, Jeremy Scher, are married, Us Weekly can confirm.  Celebrity Weddings of 2018  The 39-year-old former View cohost and her love tied the knot in Huntington, New York, on Saturday, February 17.  “As 60 of their closest family and friends filled the room, Jedediah walked down the aisle as Jeremy beamed with joy — you could truly feel the love in this magical evening!” wedding planner Michael Russo tells Us.  The glowing bride opened up to Us and shared exclusive details of the happy couple’s fairytale wedding. “I’m super excited. Super, super excited,” Bila told Us. “I always wanted to get married, but I never thought I would do the big wedding dress and the beautiful venue. I always thought I was gonna be on a beach somewhere, just a couple of friends, doing it really casual. So it’s crazy.”  The star, who donned a Rivini lace ballgown and earrings from Susan Hanover, selected a white gold eternity style wedding band with wraparound diamonds. Scher, for his part, sported a traditional tuxedo and chose a plain yellow gold band.  Celebrity Engagement Rings of 2017: See the Bling!  “Everyone always thinks of me as the rule breaker and the troublemaker,” the former Fox News contributor said. “Even in my politics, I don’t fit into a box, I break rules. But my wedding has so many traditional components, it’s so funny.”  Of the ceremony, which was attended by 60 people including View host Sunny Hostin, the New York native gushed: “What I’m looking forward to the most [about my wedding day] is that moment of walking down the aisle and seeing him and having him see me and having that moment where we’re in front together. And we’re just looking at each other. I’ll be in my dress and he’ll be in his tux. It’s just one of those once in a lifetime moments that I kind of want to hold onto.”  Celebrity Engagements of 2018  She continued: “We’ve been living together for a while and we go through the daily grind and all that, but I think there’s only one moment in your life where you’re in front of the minister and you’re saying your vows. And you’re like, ‘My life is gonna be different from here on and I’m gonna be married.’ It’s really exciting and warm and wonderful. I think that moment, that one … I’m gonna take a pause and just kind of absorb it all before I … ’cause you can’t quite get it back the same way ever again.’”  To help coordinate the affair, the Daytime Emmy Award winner tapped Michael Russo Events — wedding planner to the stars — who arranged retro tunes from Richie Hart Events and flowers from Pedestals. “The venue is dripping in garden roses and hydrangea,” a designer from Pedestal’s told Us. “Jedediah wanted a whimsical and garden feel.” The couple’s dinner offering included filet mignon and seared Atlantic salmon followed by a custom designed vanilla and chocolate wedding cake with mousse filling.

Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.	1
Caitlyn Jenner is “very proud” of Kim Kardashian West for her conversations with President Donald Trump that led to the pardon of Alice Marie Johnson, the 62-year-old great-grandmother who was incarcerated for 22 years over a first-time nonviolent drug offense.  In a sit-down interview with Variety published on Tuesday, Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter’s foray into politics, which began with a phone call from Trump and culminated in a meeting between the two at the White House in May.  “I thought they did the right thing,” Jenner, 68, told the trade magazine of the mother of three, whom she has not spoken to in years. “I was very proud of her.”  Jenner herself is “very politically involved” and has been busy working to shape policy in the Trump administration, though more so behind the scenes.  “I don’t do a lot of media. I don’t want to be seen everywhere,” she said. “Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don’t stick my nose into everything publicly.”  Caitlyn Jenner and Donald Trump Jon Kopaloff/WireImage; Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock  RELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family  A long outspoken Republican, Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 election on what she thought was a promise of continued progress for LGBTQ rights.  “On the economics side, I’m very conservative. I believe in limited government, I believe in lower taxes, I believe in less regulations, I want a thriving economy, I want Americans to be able to succeed,” Jenner said. “But socially, I’m much more progressive. We have to get them to be more progressive with social issues. It’s their biggest problem.”  But since Trump’s election, there’s been an attempt to roll back rights — including Trump’s failed attempt to stop transgender people from enrolling in the military and his move to lift federal protections for transgender students that would guarantee their freedom to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their chosen gender identity.  “I honestly don’t know what happened when he got in there,” Jenner remarked. “It was extraordinarily disappointing.”  Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq — Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017  Though she hasn’t spoken to Trump since his election (despite publicly asking the president to call her), Jenner explained that she regularly makes trips to Washington, D.C. and has had long meetings with roughly 50 members of the House and Senate and many members of Trump’s White House directly.  “I met with Paul Ryan. I’ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren’t supportive of transgender rights. … I’ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,” she said, telling Variety that the conversations were confidential but often included “invasive questions about her body and genitalia.”  “I think it’s a good thing that I’m on the Republican side because I’ve got an in,” she said. “Has this administration set us backwards? Absolutely. And every time they’ve done it, I’ve fought it. …. I fight those types of wars. I fight the equality wars. I do it all very quietly. We’re going to be okay in the end.”  She added: “What’s going on in Washington D.C. is just disgraceful. The hate, the media, all the things that are going on there. … [Trump’s] not been doing a very good job, but it’s not over yet.”  RELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack  Because Jenner’s advocacy for transgender rights on Capitol Hill has been mostly behind the scenes, many members of the LGBTQ community have felt frustrated that she hasn’t been using her celebrity and influence to help.  That criticism has caused Jenner to feel isolation from her own community. “I’ve felt it big time, and it hurts,” she said. “Sometimes this community can be really tough.”  “No matter what you say or do, they think you don’t get it because you’re this kind of white, privileged person,” Jenner confessed, disputing any notion that she isn’t an advocate. “I haven’t turned my back on anybody. … We need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality. It’s going to take some time, but we’re working on it.”	1
A reeling Johnny Depp is begging ex-wife Vanessa Paradis to get back together, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.  “Johnny now realizes that what he had with Vanessa was one of a kind,” an insider admitted of the 54-year-old, who finalized his disastrous divorce from Amber Heard, 31, in January. “She’s about the only person who can keep him in check, and the only person he really listens to.”  “Vanessa has been there for Johnny throughout this entire thing.

Anthony Senerchia Jr., who was an inspiration for the viral ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, died on Saturday at the age of 46, ending a 14-year battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  “He worked tirelessly to raise awareness for ALS and was directly responsible for the world-renowned Ice bucket challenge,” his obituary said, calling him “a fireball who tried everything in life.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Senerchia was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, in 2003.  “It’s a difficult disease and tough when you’re losing,” his wife, Jeanette, told the Journal News Media Group. “Your body is failing you. But he was a fighter… He was our light. He made our life better.”  The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went viral and raised $115 million during two months in 2014 — money that went largely to fund research. And Anthony Senerchia played a significant role in getting it started.  When Jeanette Senerchia’s cousin, golfer Chris Kennedy, was nominated early on to participate in the challenge, it was not yet specifically connected to ALS. But when Kennedy passed along the challenge to others, he chose the ALS Association as a beneficiary because of Anthony Senerchia’s battle with the disease. It took off from there.  “What started out as a small gesture to put a smile on Anthony’s face and bring some awareness to this terrible disease has turned into a national phenomenon,” Kennedy told TIME in 2014, “and it is something we never could have dreamed of.”  This article originally appeared on Time.com.	0
"A YouTube celebrity is being widely criticized for filming a dead body in Japan's Aokigahara forest, less than a year after Logan Paul got in trouble for the same stunt.  The video, posted by Qorygore, a YouTube star with about 800,000 followers who's popular in Indonesia for his videos about gaming and rap. It showed him vlogging from the ""suicide forest"" Aokigahara, famous for being the site of a disproportionate number of suicides. Qorygore found what he said was a dead body covered by a raincoat and included it in his video.  The video received nearly 600,000 views before YouTube removed it, according to the Indonesia-based publication Coconuts Jakarta.  ""I went all the way to Japan. This is Logan Paul 2.0,"" he said in the video according to The Daily Dot.  Qorygore on his YouTube channel. Qorygore/YouTube  YouTube star Logan Paul infamously pulled the same stunt in December 2017. He included a video of a dead body in the forest as part of a longer controversial vlog about Japan. YouTube ultimately punished Paul for the video, limiting his advertising revenue and removing him from a number of projects reserved for Youtube celebrities. Paul apologized for it.  Read more:YouTube released a movie with Logan Paul less than a year after his infamous 'suicide forest' video.  Qoygore's video also received severe backlash in the YouTube comments and on Twitter.  After YouTube removed Qorygore's video, the vlogger justified his actions in an interview with fellow YouTuber Eno Bening. He said he had a permit that allowed him to film dead bodies in the forest, and suggested the body may have been fake anyway.  ""It was a pile covered by a raincoat like [a ghost]. Because I respected the dead body, I didn't get really close to him,"" he said, according to a translation from Coconuts Jakarta.  In another video published hours later, Qorygore clarified that he wasn't trying to be disrespectful. He said he only showed the raincoat instead of the body underneath it.

(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

"Chris Rock reportedly upset a significant group of his fan base as he allegedly made comments joking about sexual harassment in one of his recent stand-up performances.  According to Page Six, during his performance at the Comedy Cellar, Rock explained that he refused to hire women because ""they cry rape because they want money.""  One patron who attended the gig spoke with the publication and added more context to the reports, saying that Rock joked that he would need a crew of witnesses surrounding him at all times to prevent him from falling victim to false rape allegations.  His comments didn't sit well with a few of his fans as another attendee added, ""I've seen him before and he was hysterical, but this wasn't funny at all... Nobody was laughing. There were many boos and many women who were telling him he was a sexist pig. Two people got kicked out.""

Kevin Hart is no stranger to throwing extravagant parties for holidays and special occasions. Now the 38-year-old comedic actor has once again demonstrated how much he loves first-rate celebrations by bringing Aspen, Colorado, to his home in Malibu. On December 24, Hart posted on social media he could not take his family to Aspen per tradition this year; so instead, he hired crews to pour truckloads of snow over his hilly SoCal backyard.

Taylor Swift’s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller, who was found guilty of inappropriately touching the singer during a 2013 meet-and-greet. Following four hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously decided Mueller assaulted Swift and awarded her $1.  As Gossip Cop reported, Mueller’s lawsuit against Swift was dismissed Friday after a judge decided there was insufficient evidence to suggest she caused him to get fired from his radio hosting gig. The former DJ had filed a $3 million lawsuit against the singer, claiming she falsely accused him of grabbing her butt while posing for a photo backstage at one of her 2013 concerts, leading to his wrongful termination from a radio station. The judge ultimately decided that Swift wasn’t legally responsible for Mueller losing his job, but the jury could still find her mom Andrea and radio liaison Frank Bell liable.  The trial continued Monday to address those remaining claims, as well as the singer’s countersuit against Mueller for assault and battery. As Gossip Cop noted, Swift countersued for just one dollar as her lawsuit was filed to raise awareness about sexual assault, as opposed to financial gain. Swift reportedly broke down into tears as lawyers on both sides presented their closing arguments earlier today, the sixth day of the trial.  Mueller’s attorney, Gabriel McFarland, reportedly held up the photo of Swift and his client during his closing statements and asked the jury if the smiling singer looked like she’d just been assaulted. Swift’s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, shot back during his closing argument that there’s no logical reason his client would make up a story about Mueller grabbing her butt. Baldridge stated, “[Mueller] can’t take responsibility for what he is doing,” before calling the former DJ’s lawsuit “shameful and cowardly.”  Following the closing statements, the eight-person jury consisting of two men and six women exited the court and began to deliberate for four hours. In the end, they unanimously determined Mueller groped Swift and awarded her the $1. In addition, the jurors found that Swift’s mom and Bell both did not do anything improper to interfere with Mueller’s employment. It was a complete victory for Swift’s camp, and a total loss for Mueller.	1

"American actress  Kate Garry Hudson (born April 19, 1979)[1] is an American actress, author and fashion designer. She rose to prominence for her performance in the film Almost Famous (2000), for which she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other films include How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), Bride Wars (2009), Nine (2009), and Deepwater Horizon (2016).  Hudson co-founded the fitness brand and membership program, Fabletics, operated by JustFab.[2][3] In 2016, Hudson released her first book, Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body, and in 2017, she released her second book, Pretty Fun: Creating and Celebrating a Lifetime of Tradition.  Early life [ edit ]  Hudson was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actress Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, an actor, comedian, and musician.[1] Her parents divorced when she was 18 months old and she and her older brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were raised in Snowmass, Colorado, and Pacific Palisades, California, by her mother and her mother's longtime boyfriend, actor Kurt Russell.[4] Hudson's ancestry is Italian (from her paternal grandmother), Hungarian-Jewish (from her maternal grandmother),[5][6][7] and the remainder a mix of English and some German.[8][9] Hudson was raised Jewish,[10][11] and like her mother, she practices Buddhism.[12]  Hudson has stated that her biological father ""doesn't know me from a hole in the wall"", and she considers Russell her father.[13] Hudson has described her mother as ""the woman that I've learned the most from, and who I look up to, who has conducted her life in a way that I can look up to"".[14] She has four half-siblings: Emily and Zachary Hudson, from her biological father's later marriage to actress Cindy Williams; Lalania Hudson, from his relationship with another woman;[15] and Wyatt Russell, from her mother's relationship with Kurt Russell.  In 1997, she graduated from Crossroads, a college preparatory school in Santa Monica. She was accepted to New York University, but chose to pursue an acting career instead of an undergraduate degree.[4]  Career [ edit ]  Beginnings and Almost Famous (1996–2001) [ edit ]  At age 11, Hudson performed on stage at the Santa Monica Playhouse.[16] She made her film debut in the dramedy Desert Blue (1998), and subsequently appeared in the romantic comedy 200 Cigarettes (1999). She took on the roles of a college student in the psychological thriller Gossip, the lesbian daughter of the titular character in the dramedy Dr. T & the Women and that of a waitress in the romantic comedy About Adam, all of which were released throughout 2000.[16]  Her breakthrough came with the role of a veteran groupie in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical dramedy Almost Famous (2000). She ""hung in and had turned down leads in other movies just to play the part"" and soon obtained it ""because of her loyalty"", according to Crowe.[16] For her performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[4] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, ""best-of"" list, saying, ""This power ballad of a movie also happens to be Crowe's greatest (and most personal) film thanks to the golden gods of Stillwater and their biggest fan, Kate Hudson's incomparable Penny Lane.""[17] She worked hard in avoiding association with her well-known parents, as she did not want to be perceived as someone who ""rode on somebody's coattails"".[4]  Commercial success (2002–2009) [ edit ]  In 2002, Hudson appeared in the remake of the historical romance The Four Feathers, as the fiancée of a young British officer (played by Heath Ledger). The film was panned by critics and had a lukewarm box office response.[18] In her next film, the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Hudson starred with Matthew McConaughey, as a writer for a women's magazine who starts dating a guy and eventually drives him away using only the ""classic mistakes women make"" in relationships. The film was a box office success, grossing over US$100 million upon its release. She also starred opposite Naomi Watts in the Merchant-Ivory film Le Divorce (2003), portraying a woman who, with her sister, dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of her former brother-in-law. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a ""C"" rating and wrote: ""I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters"".[19]  Hudson in July 2006  Her next romantic comedies, Alex and Emma (2003), in which she played a stubborn stenographer, and Raising Helen (2004), taking on the role of a young woman who becomes the guardian of her deceased sister's children, were released to varying degrees of success. In 2005, Hudson starred in the supernatural thriller The Skeleton Key, as a young hospice nurse who acquires a job at a New Orleans plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house. In its review, The Washington Post, describing her, wrote: ""Hudson, who dials back her native, Goldie-given charm here to give Caroline a no-nonsense brusqueness, manages to convincingly convey a fearless bullheadedness rather than less sympathetic naivete"".[20] The film was a box office hit, grossing over US$91.9 million worldwide ($47.9 million in North America).[21] Her next film, the comedy You, Me and Dupree, in which she appeared with Owen Wilson and Matt Dillon as one half of a couple who allows an unemployed friend to move in, grossed US$21.5 million on its opening weekend of July 14, 2006.[22] It eventually made US$130.4 million worldwide.[23]  In 2007, Hudson directed the short film Cutlass, one of Glamour magazine's ""Reel Moments"" based on readers' personal essays, which starred Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Virginia Madsen, Chevy Chase and Kristen Stewart.[24] In the romantic comedy Fool's Gold (2008), her second film with Matthew McConaughey, Hudson took on the role a divorced woman who returns with her former husband while searching for a lost treasure. She was certified in scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef for the underwater scenes. The film made US$111.2 million worldwide.[25] In My Best Friend's Girl, another romantic comedy released in 2008, Hudson played the colleague of an amiable guy (Jason Biggs). Despite negative reviews, it was a moderate commercial success.[26]  Hudson starred in Bride Wars (2009),[27] alongside Anne Hathaway, playing two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day. The film was named among the 10 worst chick flicks of all time by Time in 2010,[28] but was successful financially, grossing US$114.6 million globally.[29] Her next film was the musical Nine, directed by Rob Marshall, in which she played a Vogue fashion journalist, alongside Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, and Judi Dench.

In 2011, Hudson played a quickwitted, carefree ad executive in the romantic comedy A Little Bit of Heaven, and an unmarried attorney in another romantic comedy, Something Borrowed, based on Emily Giffin's novel of the same name. In is review for the latter, Detroit News remarked: ""Kate Hudson looks exhausted, as if she is as tired of wading through another one of her feckless duds as we are of watching them"".[31] While A Little Bit of Heaven found a limited release in theaters, Something Borrowed was a moderate commercial success.[32]  In 2012, Hudson was cast on the Fox teen comedy series Glee, in the recurring role of a dance teacher at the fictitious New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts.[33][34][35] In 2013, Hudson appeared in the political thriller The Reluctant Fundamentalist, as a photographer and the girlfriend of a professor at Lahore University.

Hudson said the tabloid's statements were ""a blatant lie"" and she was concerned about the impact the false report could have on impressionable young women.[55] The newspaper apologized and compensated her.[56]  Hudson says that she does not enjoy seeing herself on screen, saying, ""I get cold and I shake and I sweat"" when watching her performances for the first time.[14]  In 2016, Hudson said: ""Meditation has been the most helpful and life-changing thing for me. You can feel the difference when you meditate on a regular basis. At least I can.... I started practicing transcendental meditation a year and a half ago so I meditate 20 minutes in the morning and I try to do another 20 minutes in the afternoon.""[57]  Relationships [ edit ]  Hudson married Chris Robinson, the frontman for The Black Crowes, on December 31, 2000, in Aspen, Colorado.

On November 18, 2006, Robinson filed divorce papers, citing ""irreconcilable differences"".[59] The divorce was finalized on October 22, 2007, with Hudson being granted joint custody of Ryder.[60]  In early 2010, Hudson began dating Muse frontman Matt Bellamy.[61][62][63] Hudson and Bellamy became engaged in April 2011[64] and their son, Bingham Hawn Bellamy, was born on July 9, 2011.[65][66] On December 9, 2014, the couple announced that they had ended their engagement.[67] However, Hudson and Bellamy are on good terms with one another, successfully co-parenting their son.[68]  On April 6, 2018, Hudson announced she and boyfriend Danny Fujikawa are expecting their first child together, a girl.[69] On October 2, she announced the birth of her daughter Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa via Instagram.[70]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Published works [ edit ]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]"	0
© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  Ariel Winter slammed the media and body shamers in a lengthy Twitter rant on Monday night. The star, who recently opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about her estranged relationship with her mother, also defended her interview after it sparked some backlash online.    In a series of tweets posted late Monday night, the “Modern Family” actress wrote, “Rant – Something I wish people would realize… I am NOT trying to be featured on Snapchat, I am not trying to be pap’d everywhere I go, I am literally just LIVING and unfortunately, I can’t do that without paparazzi following me around everyday. I’m not trying to show you my a-- in shorts when I go to the grocery store. I’m trying to live my life. People wear shorts. People have wardrobe malfunctions. No one is perfect.”  Winter continued, “I don’t know what to wear everyday so I look ‘appropriate’ and ‘fashionable.’ Also, screw to always having to look appropriate and fashionable. For what? Society? Who gets to decide what is appropriate and fashionable? I wear what I like and no one should fault me for that. I don’t want people to constantly see me in the news for going to dinner, or grocery shopping, or anything. I want to be in the news when I ASK for it by going to a publicized event. So trust me, I don’t want to see me in shorts putting water in my car every single d--- day as much as you don’t.”  She went on to address the cruel criticism she received after her interview with The Hollywood Reporter, in which she spoke openly about being sexualized by her mother at a young age. “I’d also like to address the tweets I get saying ‘you accused your own mother of sexualizing you yet you’re a w----.’ I was a CHILD being dressed like I was 24. I was 8-13 years old. I wasn’t an ADULT as I am now. As a child, you do what you’re told regardless of what is good for you,” Winter said. The star added, “Just because I DECIDE to show my body occasionally doesn’t mean I’m unintelligent or that I’m talentless or that I have no self respect.”  As Gossip Cop reported, Winter slammed the suggestion that she was “asking for it” by posting a photo on Instagram of herself wearing a bikini while on a boat with her nieces in 2015. After she uploaded the picture on social media, the comments section soon filled with remarks criticizing the actress’s body. Winter later wrote, “It sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I’m ‘asking for it.’ Celebrate you and don’t let anyone’s comments allow you to think less of yourself. Us girls have to stick together!!!”  Related video: Ariel Winter wore a rubber dress to an Emmy's pre-party, and here's where you can get one just like it (Provided by Hello Giggles)	1
Well, this is weird. A new report claims that FKA Twigs has been leaning on Robert Pattinson’s ex, Kristen Stewart, for advice about their relationship. Hmm.  Is Kristen Stewart, 26, doling out love advice to her ex’s fiancee? One shocking report claims that FKA Twigs, 28, has been reaching out to the Twilight actress in hopes of figuring out her future husband, Robert Pattinson, 29.  Uh oh. Is there trouble in paradise for the future Mr. and Mrs. Pattinson? Unfortunately, a new report claims that Rob is “off the rails,” and that his fiancee, FKA Twigs, is having trouble reaching him. So, what’s a girl to do? Talk to his ex, obviously!  “Twigs knows that Kristen understands him almost better than anyone,” a source told OK magazine’s May 23 issue. “She thinks it’s worth a shot.” Hopefully, Kristen can help FKA figure out what to do about her man and his alleged troubles. Plus, this isn’t the first time there have been rumors of trouble between the engaged couple. As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, the pair spent her birthday together — but she wasn’t wearing her engagement ring. Awkward.  The report claims that Rob is “very self-destructive” when he’s “not working.” It also claims that FKA has asked Rob to find his chill, but that he’s more or less ignored her and continues “nonstop partying.” Yikes. Maybe reaching out to Kristen wasn’t the worst idea, especially after the three of them had a run-in at the 2016 Met Ball on May 2.  In the meantime, Kristen has been focusing on her own rocky love life. Not only did she reportedly break up with rumored girlfriend Soko before the Met Ball, but she was seen leaving an after party with sexy model Stella Maxwell after the big event. And to make things even more confusing, Kristen fled back to Los Angeles to spend time with her rumored ex, Alicia Cargile, after her night out with Stella. Hmm.  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — Do YOU think Twigs and Kristen are really talking to each other about RPattz? Comment below with your thoughts!	1

"Kylie Kristen Jenner (born August 10, 1997)[4] is an American reality television personality, model, entrepreneur, socialite, and social media personality. She has starred in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians since 2007 and is the founder and owner of cosmetic company Kylie Cosmetics.  In 2012, she collaborated with the clothing brand PacSun, along with her sister Kendall, and created a line of clothing, ""Kendall & Kylie"". In 2015, Jenner launched her own cosmetics line called Kylie Lip Kits, which was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics the following year.[5] She also released a mobile app that reached number one on the iTunes App Store.[6]  In 2014 and 2015, Time magazine listed the Jenner sisters on their list of the most influential teens in the world, citing their considerable influence among teens on social media.[7][8] As of 2018, with over 100 million followers, she is one of the top 10 most followed people on Instagram.[9] In 2017, Jenner was placed on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, making her the youngest person to be featured on the list.[10] Jenner starred on her own spin-off series, Life of Kylie, which premiered on E! on August 6, 2017.[11]  According to Forbes magazine, her net worth is $900 million. This is mainly attributed to her having 100% ownership of Kylie Cosmetics.[12] In an August 2018 issue of Forbes, they predicted that Jenner will become the youngest self-made billionaire ever,[13] however others disputed the designation ""self-made"".[14]  Early life  Jenner was born in Los Angeles, California. She is the youngest daughter of 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner Caitlyn Jenner (known as Bruce at the time) and TV personality Kris Jenner.[a][15] She has an older sister, Kendall. On Kris's side of the family, she has three older half-sisters, Kourtney, Kim and Khloé Kardashian, and one older half-brother, Rob. Jenner also has three older half-brothers from Caitlyn's side of the family—Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner—and an older half-sister, Casey.  Jenner attended Sierra Canyon School, where she was a member of the cheerleading team. Jenner claims to have performed in plays while attending school, along with community plays.[16] In 2012, she became homeschooled and enrolled in an at-home education program, from which she graduated with a high school diploma in July 2015 from Laurel Springs School in Ojai, California.[17][18]  Career  2007–2012: Keeping Up with the Kardashians  In 2007, Jenner, along with her parents and siblings, Kendall, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, began appearing in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which chronicles the personal and professional lives of their family members.[19] The series was successful for its network, E!, and has resulted in the creation of numerous spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Khloé & Lamar, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, in which Jenner has made multiple guest appearances.[20] The sisters hosted Glee: The 3D Concert Movie at the Regency Village Theater in Westwood, California in August 2011,[21] In 2011, they were featured in Seventeen magazine's Style Stars of the Year,[22][23] and selected them as ""Style Ambassadors"" for the magazine.[24] The two hosted the premiere of The Vow in Hollywood in February 2012.[25] The Jenners also interviewed the cast of The Hunger Games premiere in the at The Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles in March 2012.[26] Later in 2012, she starred alongside her sister Kendall and mother Kris Jenner in an episode of American reality television series America's Next Top Model.  2013–2014: Early endorsements  Jenner has two nail lacquers from the Nicole by OPI nail polish brand called Wear Something Spar-kylie and Rainbow in the S-kylie.[27] Kendall and Kylie earned $100,000 each for their OPI endorsements in 2013.[28] On November 15, 2013, the Jenner sisters announced that they would launch The Kendall & Kylie Collection with PacSun[29] which launched on February 2013. Since its conception, the sisters have released several collections for this line. In July 2013, the Jenner sisters launched a jewelry line with Pascal Mouawad's Glamhouse[30][31] to create the Metal Haven by Kendall & Kylie jewelery collection.  Jenner set up an eBay account where she auctions old clothing to raise money for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[32] Jenner joined her family in a charity yard sale on November 10, 2013.[33] Proceeds from the sale were donation-matched and sent to Share Our Strength: No Kid Hungry and the Greater Los Angeles Fisher House Foundation. She joined Khloé, Kendall, Lil Twist, and The Game at PINZ bowling alley in Studio City, California for a charity bowling game on January 19, 2014. The event was held to raise money for The Robin Hood Foundation, a nonprofit for which The Game pledged to raise $1 million in donations.[34] The Jenner sisters participated in singer Chris Brown's two Kick'n It For Charity Celebrity Kickball games in Glendale, California on July 19, 2014[35] and on August 16, 2014.[36] At the first game, she competed on actor/singer Quincy Brown's team. Jenner donated to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender community.[37]  In February 2014, she and Kendall launched a shoe and handbag line for Steve Madden's Madden Girl line.[38][39] The Jenner sisters co-hosted the 2014 Much Music Video Awards, where Kylie made her acting debut in a promo for the show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in June 2014.[40] In August 2014, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer PartyNextDoor's ""Recognize"" music video.[41] Jenner and her sister Kendall co-authored the dystopian science fiction novel Rebels: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia, which revolved around two twin girls, Lex and Livia, in a ""self-sustaining biosphere"" put together from the remains of Earth known as Indra.[42] The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for the writing of the book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.[43] The novel was mostly panned by critics, and sold only 13,000 copies in its first four months on sale.[44] The book was also given a sequel, Time of the Twins, which was also co-authored by the Jenner sisters. Jenner launched a line of hair extensions through a partnership with Bellami Hair, called Kylie Hair Kouture, in October 2014.[45][46][47]  2015–present: Rise of Kylie Cosmetics  Jenner became skincare brand Nip + Fab's second-ever ambassador in March 2015.[48]  The Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015.[49] In May 2015, an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation.[50] Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips.[51] As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the ""Kylie Jenner Challenge"" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method).[52] Jenner responded to this by stating, ""I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.""[53] In June 2015, the Jenner sisters launched their clothing line Kendall + Kylie with British fashion retailer Topshop.[54] This Topshop clothing line also featured swimsuits.[55] In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit.[56] In September 2015, Jenner launched her new personalized website and mobile app.[57] In October 2015, Jenner starred in Tyga's music video for his song ""Dope'd Up"".[58][59][58]  In February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an inital 15,000 to 500,000.[60] Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders.[61][62][63][64][65] The song in the video was revealed to be ""Three Strikes"" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, whose true identity remains unknown and who goes by the alias ""Lisa"",[66] was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself.[67][68][69][70] However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band.[71][72] In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song ""Beautiful Day"", with Lil Yachty, model Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye.[73]In fall of 2016, Jenner was announced to be the new face of PUMA along with Rae Sremmurd.[74] In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.[75][76][77]  In June 2017, Jenner announced two new cosmetics sets in collaboration with her sister Khloe Kardashian and the Kylie Cosmetics KoKo collection.[78] Later that month, Jenner was accused of stealing designs for a series of camouflage items released on her online store from independent design label PluggedNYC, whose creative director supported the claims.[79][80][81][82] Later that June, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the Forbes Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.[10] Jenner collaborated with Melbourne-based sunglasses brand Quay Australia[83][84] to release a line of sunglasses, Quay x Kylie.[85][86][87] In 2018, the company Kylie Cosmetics has reportedly sold about $630 million dollars worth of makeup.  Jenner stars in a reality show revolving around her life, Life of Kylie, which premiered in August 2017. The reality show drew half the viewers that brother Rob Kardashian’s reality series Rob & Chyna did on its debut.[88]  Personal life  In September 2017, it was reported that Jenner was expecting her first child with rapper Travis Scott. On February 1, 2018, Jenner gave birth to a girl. The couple had named their child Stormi Webster.[89][90] Jenner had previously dated rapper Tyga between 2014 and 2017.[91][92][93][94]  Controversies  Kendall + Kylie ""Rock vs. Rap"" collection  On June 28, 2017, the Jenner sisters announced that they would be releasing a line of vintage T-shirts for their Kendall + Kylie line of clothing called Rock vs. Rap,[95][96] featuring the likenesses of various rock and rap artists[97] including The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Metallica, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Ozzy Osbourne, Led Zeppelin, with pictures of the Jenner sisters superimposed over them.[95] The announcement of this line of products was met with swift backlash from relatives and representatives of the figures depicted on the shirts themselves, including Sharon Osbourne,[98] Jim Jampol,[99][100] and Voletta Wallace, mother of Biggie Smalls.[101] They were also criticized on social media and were called ""insensitive.""[102] Wallace, The Doors' manager and the estate of Jim Morrison issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenner sisters, writing that they did not authorize the sisters' use of the likenesses of these musical icons.[103][104] The Jenners apologized for the shirts, and pulled them from retail.[95]  Forbes cover  Jenner appeared on the cover of the August 2018 issue of Forbes. They estimated that she had a net worth of $900 million, and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest “self-made” billionaire. This would beat out Mark Zuckerberg who became a billionaire at age 23.[105] However, the publication’s use of the term “self-made” sparked widespread criticism and jokes online.[106] The Dictionary.com Twitter handle cheekily defined the term self made.[107] Comedian Fat Jew started a GoFundMe page to help Kylie Jenner earn another $100 million dollars so that she would officially become a billionaire.[108] Comedian Michelle Wolf had a viral stand-up comedy act related to how Jenner earned her fame and success.[109] Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society.[110][111][112] However, celebrities such as Jenner’s half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made. Hilton even claimed that she also considers herself self-made.[113][114]  Lawsuits/Civil Disputes  ""Kylie"" trademark  In February 2017, Australian singer Kylie Minogue won a legal battle against Jenner for name trademark ""Kylie"". Jenner had filed a U.S. trademark application for use of the name ""Kylie"" for ""advertising services"" and ""endorsement services"" in 2015. Minogue's case had dismissed Jenner as a “secondary reality television personality”.[115]  Vlada Haggarty  In January 2017, make-up artist Vlada Haggarty had her lawyers claim that Jenner had stolen the creative style and aesthetic of her own work, such as the dripping gloss lip and golden finger tips, for her own products, and that Jenner had a history of taking Haggerty's original dripping lip art and passing it off as her own. Jenner later credited Vlada on social media and her work on the creation of the logo and an undisclosed settlement was paid to avoid any future legal issues.[116][117][118]  Neon lip logo  Sara Hope, a British painter whose work has been featured in art galleries in several cities across the globe, filed a lawsuit against Jenner and NBC Universal for the use of a neon lip logo. Hope stated that Jenner posted to her social media accounts an image that was remarkably similar to Hope's most famous piece, ""Temptation Neon"" and used it to promote Jenner's TV series Life of Kylie. Production art created for that series, including the lip design, was created by a third party designer and not by Jenner or any of her staff.[119]  Filmography  Television  Music videos  Film  As an actress Year Title Role Notes Ref. 2018 Ocean's 8 Cameo [137]  Awards and nominations  Notes  ^ Kris is Kylie's biological mother.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Invictus Games.  Up until now, the courtship between American actress Meghan Markle and roguish Prince Harry, has been proceeding at a perfectly private, glacial, Jane Austen–like pace.  Prince Harry sneaks a kiss at the Invictus Games. Photo: GRHO, RYMI, NGRE/GLH / Patriot Pics / NGRE / BACK  But over the last week, the royal pair of the moment made a gradual coming out at the Invictus Games — the multi-sport event Prince Harry started for wounded veterans. Last weekend, they made their first public appearance but didn’t sit together. Then, this week, they turned it up a notch and not only sat together in public but also held hands.  Yet, this weekend, the lovebirds really threw it all on the table. Not only did Prince Harry reportedly leave his seat to join Markle and her mom in their box, Harry was actually spotted planting a kiss on her cheek.  Of course this gesture is still delicate enough to be part of the Royal Courtship Plan. But those watching closely predict that Harry could be bending the knee very soon. Or as some theorists are suggesting, perhaps this means they are already engaged?	0

"Some two months after American Horror Story: Cult wrapped up last November, FX announced that season eight was a go. Here, everything we know so far about Apocalypse:  1. It began shooting in the summer. In April, showrunner Ryan Murphy said that shooting would commence in mid-June. Also in June, FX confirmed that the new season would premiere Sept. 12.  2. It is not called Radioactive, but Apocalypse. The past few seasons of AHS have stayed relatively mysterious until they premiered, and season eight is so far no different. Though internet sleuths discovered that a trademark was filed for American Horror Story: Radioactive and became convinced that the new season would be named as such, in July, FX announced that season eight is officially called Apocalypse.  3. It's set in the future, technically. While some rumors place the setting of the new season in 2032, Murphy said in April that it would be set ""18 months from today,"" so in October 2019. ""It’s still topical, but [set in] the future, which I’ve never done,"" he said. ""I think people will like it. It’s different from what we’ve done before."" Theorists have noted that Oct. 6, 2019 marks the 58th anniversary of a speech by JFK telling Americans to build nuclear bomb shelters, which would track with the alleged ""radioactive"" theme. Murphy has also said that it will be more fantasy-based than the show's previous two seasons. ""It’s heightened,"" he said in April. ""It’s not necessarily as real and grounded as the past season. We’re sort of getting back to Asylum, and Coven. That’s the tone of it.""    4. Kathy Bates will be back. After star turns in Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, and Roanoke, Bates had to sit out Cult due to her commitment to her Netflix show Disjointed, but Murphy has confirmed that she'll be back for season eight and that she's one of the leads. I hope she gets to yell ""LIIIIIIIES"" again.  FX  5. MVPs Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters will also be back. Paulson and Peters have lead roles, per Murphy, and Peters will be a hairstylist. Cheyenne Jackson, Adina Porter, Billy Eichner, Leslie Grossman, and Emma Roberts will be back too.  6. Dame. Joan. Collins. Murphy confirmed in April that the iconic Dynasty actress will join the cast in season eight, though of course has not given hints as to what she'll be doing besides being Evan Peters's grandmother. Does it even matter, though? She's Joan Collins.  Joan Collins in 2018. Getty Images  7. It's the Coven/Murder House crossover season. In June, Ryan tweeted that the next season of AHS would be the promised mashup of seasons one and three. Also of note: Connie Britton is no longer attached to 9-1-1, which means she could be free to return as her Murder House character Vivien Harmon (who died, but this show loves ghosts, so that doesn't really matter).    The Coven/Murder House AHS crossover season won't be happening next year...because it's happening THIS YEAR. AHS #8 WITCHES RULE THIS SEPTEMBER — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) June 14, 2018  On Aug. 26, Britton and Dylan McDermott confirmed their return as their Murder House husband-and-wife duo, Vivien and Ben. According to the Instagram caption from Britton's set photo, Sarah Paulson will direct at least one episode this season.  8. Remember the Harmon baby? He’s all grown up — and he’s back. In July, Murphy announced that Cody Fern will reprise his role as Michael Langdon in Apocalypse.    Excited to announce Cody Fern will be playing the role of Michael Langdon in American Horror Story: Apocalypse.

I don’t know, but I’ll tell you what: I love devil babies.  9. Jessica Lange is coming back.

Alison Sweeney, the former host of The Biggest Loser and star of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, has been granted a temporary restraining order against a man who has been consistently harassing her on social media.  Jon Christopher LuVisi, 49, has allegedly been peppering Sweeney’s various social media accounts with comments for years, but they’d recently gotten more hostile, prompting Sweeney to apply for the restraining order.  “The Defendant’s unwanted contact with the Plaintiff has spanned the course of years, but in the past nine months escalated to such an extent that Plaintiff reasonable fears for her safety and the safety of her family,” read the court documents.  READ MORE: Lauren Conrad gives birth to first child  “[Sweeney] has suffered significant emotional distress, lack of sleep and fear for the safety of herself and her family, including her [two] children, resulting from the Defendant’s repeated harassment and threats.”  The judge in the case ordered LuVisi to stay 1,000 feet away from the actor, her home, work and car. The order also states that he must stay away from her kids’ school.  Sweeney, 40, has said in the past that LuVisi has tried to extort money from her and consistently threatened her. He also implied that he and the Days star were having an affair. (Sweeney has been married to California Highway Patrol officer David Sanov since 2000.)  She didn’t want to take any chances, especially when LuVisi allegedly sent her messages like “B***h you better answer me,” “Don’t push me. Your really starting to piss me off,” and “You can’t hide from me you sorry ass b***h.”  Sweeney says that every time she tried to block LuVisi from contacting her, he would just make up a new account and continue the harassment. She also claims that somehow LuVisi discovered her home address and posted it to the internet.  READ MORE: Daniel Dae Kim comes clean about his ‘Hawaii Five-O’ exit  Last month, Sweeney contacted the CHP (where her husband works) and the organization conducted a joint investigation with Oklahoma Law Enforcement.  The authorities spoke with LuVisi’s wife, who said that her husband had become “infatuated” with Sweeney and that she had considered divorce earlier in the year because of “his obsession.”  Sweeney was the host of The Biggest Loser from 2007 until 2015, and she recently returned to Days in her former role of Sami Brady (she debuted in the role in 1993, then left to host Loser).  She has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (2015) and won the Special Fan Emmy Award for America’s Favourite Villain in 2002. To date, Sweeney has appeared in almost 1,800 episodes of Days.	0
"Ben Affleck's back in the headlines, literally.  The ""Justice League"" star was all over the internet this weekend thanks to some shirtless beach photos showing off the massive phoenix tattoo that covers his entire back. Though he initially said the ink was temporary way back in 2016, the new shots prove it's the real deal.  Ben was photographed sans shirt while filming a new movie, ""Triple Frontier,"" alongside Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac and Garrett Hedlund. Though all the photos are kind of amazing, it's Affleck's ink that generated most of the talk online.  ""[It's] fake for a movie,"" Affleck said of the piece in 2016. ""I actually do have a number of tattoos but I try to have them in places where you don't have to do a lot of cover up they get sort of addictive, tattoos, after awhile.""  Despite his outright lie at the time, exes Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez both chimed in with some serious shade about the tattoo as well. ""You know what we would say in my hometown about that? 'Bless his heart,'"" Garner told Vanity Fair. ""A phoenix rising from the ashes. Am I the ashes in this scenario? I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.""  On ""Watch What Happens Live,"" J.Lo added, ""It's awful! What are you doing? His tattoos always have too many colors, they shouldn’t be so colorful. They should be cooler.""  With the new photos confirming the tatt's authenticity, Twitter piled on the haterade -- see the most savage reactions below:  Don’t mock Ben Affleck’s phoenix tattoo.

"Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna have reached a private agreement over custody of their 10-month-old daughter Dream Kardashian, while the Lashed salon owner will no longer pursue a domestic violence case against her ex...for now.  The two had split earlier this year after a one-year relationship. In July, Rob posted on Instagram a slew of naked pics of Chyna and a video of her kissing another man, which he said she sent him. He accused her of cheating, belittled her and threatened that she would never see their daughter again unless she stopped ""the alcohol and drugs and cocaine and X and E.""  Chyna responded on Snapchat by claiming Rob had ""beat"" her and obtained a temporary domestic violence restraining order against him. It does not involve Dream.  The lawyer also responded to recent reports about their custody agreement, saying, ""To correct some false statements...Rob does not have 'more than 50 percent custody.'"""	1
Millie Bobby Brown’s got more skills than Eleven! The 13-year-old Stranger Things actress visited The Tonight Show on Tuesday to promote the Netflix show’s second season.  She decided to recap the beloved series' first season in an epic rap.  “Let’s go back to Indiana circa 1983, just four boys in the basement, chillin’ playing D&D,” she began, effortlessly rapping in her jumpsuit. “There was Lucas, there was Willy Will, and Dustin, there was Mike. But one night Will goes missing while he’s riding on his bike. Yes, that’s when they met me, Eleven. I had no hair on my head. I had been so close to dead.”  She continued, finally referencing her character’s signature traits, rapping, “All I need is my Eggo waffles, I’m in love with those. What I’m left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose.”  MORE: 'Stranger Things' Star David Harbour Proves He Had 'Steve' Hair Long Before Joe Keery: Epic Pics!  Brown later opened up about the fan reaction to the show, specifically people dressing as Eleven for Halloween.  “I can’t really think about it too much, because if I think about it, it freaks me out,” she said. “Grown men are dressing up like me. But I think it’s cool. I’m grateful for it.”  She also gave host Jimmy Fallon a bit of a spoiler, saying that Mike and Eleven kiss again in the second season. Turns out, the moment wasn’t exactly romantic when Brown was filming with her co-star Finn Wolfhard.  “He was like, ‘I’m coming in,’” she said, miming Wolfhard’s tight-lipped advance. “And he was like a ventriloquist. It was the craziest thing.”  She noted that whenever she hears the ‘80s song that was playing during the moment she gets “goosebumps.” But when the audience “aww’d” over that statement she replied, “No! In disgust.”  Brown also gushed over her favorite TV family – the Kardashians.

My mom, she’s always like, ‘I can’t watch it,’ but then she sits there and she’s like…,” Brown said, miming her mom watching the show with her. “I’m obsessed with them. I follow them on social media. I think they’re really great, they’re so entertaining.”  And it turns out the feeling is mutual. Khloe Kardashian took to Twitter to obsess over the Netflix series.

To read his full statement, click below!  “My family and I are overwhelmed with this tragedy, but we are sticking together and we’ll get through it,” Chris Soules, 35, told In Touch. “Thank you for reaching out.”  As it’s previously been reported, Bachelor star Chris Soules was driving a 2008 Chevrolet truck when he crashed into a John Deere tractor driven by fellow Iowan farmer Kenneth Mosher.

After two high-risk pregnancies, Kim Kardashian West took a different route for baby no. 3, whom she welcomed in January 2018, with Kanye West: surrogacy.  The news comes hot on the heels of the last season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which explored the reality star’s desire to have another child despite the significant health challenges she faces.  Already mother to daughter North, 4½, and son Saint, 2, here’s a look back at what Kardashian West, 37, has said about wanting to expand her family in recent years.  Want all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs? Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.  A Pregnancy Scare  In May 2016, just five months after Saint was born, Kardashian West bought three pregnancy tests and took one in a cramped airplane bathroom during a flight, taking to Snapchat to share the experience with her fans.  Kim Kardashian/Snapchat  “I’m legit in the airplane bathroom taking a pregnancy test because I’m having a little bit of a scare,” she said in one video.  After her frantic message, the star snapped a pic of the clear “not pregnant” result.  Kim Kardashian/Snapchat  The next day, Kardashian West took to Snapchat yet again, this time to explain her decision to document the experience.  “Let’s discuss,” she started. “Some people were asking me why I would Snapchat the pregnancy test on the airplane. And I just thought it was funny, because I’ve been so private before — and what do I really care if I was pregnant again?”  “I didn’t get my period this month, so I was just really confused,” she added. “And I couldn’t stand to be on a flight for 10 hours not knowing.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Is Trying for a Third Baby — But Doctors Warn It’s Not Safe  Exploring Other Options  A few months later, in a November 2016 episode of KUWTK, Kardashian West broached the possibility of having someone else carry her third child.  Kardashian West then met with two fertility specialists, including Dr. Wong, who was on board with the option considering the medical risks of a third pregnancy for the star.  “Using a surrogate is not an unreasonable option,” he said. “If our goal is to grow your family like you want to, then a surrogate makes sense.”  “If the two doctors that I trust have told me it wouldn’t be safe for me to get pregnant again, I have to listen to that,” said Kardashian West. “But because I don’t know anyone that has been a surrogate or used one, I didn’t really think about that as an option for me.”  Kim Kardashian West/Instagram  At sister Kourtney Kardashian‘s suggestion, Kardashian west met with a woman named Natalie who had both carried a pregnancy herself and used a surrogate.  “I’m more worried because I gave birth to two [children] — there’s a sense in me that because I went through all that pain for these two babies and that I know we did this together … There’s no one that would feel your love [like that],” she said. “They are literally near your heart and inside of you.”  “My bond with my kids is so strong,” she continued. “I think my biggest fear if I had a surrogate is: Would I love them the same? That’s the main thing I keep thinking about.”  Natalie reassured the star that the bond is just as strong, and Kardashian West sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the news.  “So I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t carry another one,” she said. “I want to explore surrogacy.”  “That scares me for you,” said Jenner. “What if she gives birth and then grabs the baby and makes a run for it?”  “I don’t think she can,” said Kardashian West. “Also, the best thing is I could have a new baby and have no one know and live my life for a good year before we announce it.”  FROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Reveals the Emotional Way She Told Her Daughters She Was Pregnant  Baby Fever Hits Hard  In an April episode of the most recent season of KUWTK, the reality star revealed that she and West, 40, are trying to conceive again despite their challenging pregnancies.  “I want my kids to have siblings, but the doctors don’t feel like it’s safe for me,” she said, telling sister Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian that she’s “going to try to have one more baby.”  “I’d love nothing more than to expand my family and just know that I have this world at home that’s safe,” she said. “And if for some reason I left this earth sooner than I really wanted to, then my kids would have a support system at home — so that I know that they would be okay if I wasn’t here.”  “Kanye and I have always talked about having more kids,” she admitted. “But after what I went through in Paris, the urgency is even greater.”  At the time, Kardashian West and her husband had been working hard on their relationship, having finally settled into a good place after enduring a period of marital strain sparked by her Paris robbery last October, followed swiftly by the rapper’s hospitalized for exhaustion in November.  “Everyone knows she had major medical complications during her other two pregnancies,” a source told PEOPLE. “But whenever things are going great with Kanye, Kim talks about having another baby.” (The insider also acknowledged that a third baby would be “a great storyline for the show.”)  Source: Kim Kardashian Instagram  Getting Serious About Surrogacy  In the same April KUWTK episode, Kardashian West underwent a procedure in an attempt to help her become able to carry another child — but it wasn’t successful.  “I can’t carry anymore kids … it’s the worst,” she confessed. “I give up.”  As a result, the star decided it was time to revisit the option of hiring a surrogate.  “Kanye was really nervous about the surgery … but I know he would want to have more kids,” she said. “I feel like surrogacy is the only option for me. Kanye and I are going to look into other options and see what we are comfortable with … but I’m definitely leaning towards [surrogacy].”  “I always knew surrogacy was an option — now it’s my reality,” she eventually concluded. “Whatever is meant to be will be.”  A Plan in Motion  In June 2017, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that the stars had hired a surrogate. TMZ was the first to report the news.  It’s a Girl!  The soon-to-be mother of three told host Ellen DeGeneres that her 4-year-old daughter North had taken to calling the unborn child, “Baby Sister” during an October 2017 appearance on the talk show. “My daughter thinks she’s tricky,” Kardashian West said. “We had a baby shower over the weekend, and I thought, ‘You know, I really do want to have a baby shower because I want [North] to feel that something’s coming and for her to really understand it.’ ”  A New Experience  While she was excited to share the news with the rest of the Kardashian crew, Kardashian West admitted the situation felt different than when she was pregnant the first two times. “It’s kind of weird when it’s not you, so I don’t know whether I should start eating donuts and celebrate like I would like old times or just go to the gym,” Kardashian West told sister Kourtney on a December 2017 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. “I’m totally gonna forget and then a month before I’m gonna be like holly sh—, we need to get a nursery.”  She’s Here!  The couple’s second daughter has arrived via surrogate, Kardashian West shared via her website on January 16, 2018. The baby girl was born Jan. 15, at 12:47 a.m., weighing 7 lbs., 6 oz. “Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,” she wrote in a post titled ‘She’s Here!’.  “We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.”	1

It's no secret that the past few Keeping Up With The Kardashains episode has seen tensions rise between sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe.  And the family feud continued on Sunday night's episode when the Kardashian-Jenner brood all got together to decide who would and wouldn't make the invite list for their annual Christmas Eve party.  Sitting around the kitchen table together, momager Kris, Kim and Khloe all ganged up on Kourtney when they slammed her for not wanting to invite her ex-boyfriend Scott, and then Kendall when they refused to invite her dad Caitlyn Jenner.  Bad blood? Kendall Jenner was left livid on Sunday night's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians when her mom Kris refused to invite her dad Caitlyn to the annual Christmas Eve party  The hostilities began when Kourtney told her family she didn't want to invite Scott as her then boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, would be there - to which Kris insisted her baby daddy had to come as he was still part of the family.  'What about my dad?' butted in Kendall - pointing out Kris' ex-husband also still had connections to the family.  'Scott has never done anything mean or said anything negative, so that's different,' shouted Kim across the table.  Drama: The hostilities began when Kourtney told her family she didn't want to invite Scott as her then boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, would be there - to which Kris insisted her baby daddy had to come as he was still part of the family  Not hearing her: The family refused to listen to Kourtney's wishes of not inviting her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick to the family party  If Scott's invited, why not Caitlyn? Not having a bar of it, a livid and insulted Kendall replied: 'Is that actually a joke? They have both done f**ked up things in different ways'  Not having a bar of it, a livid and insulted Kendall replied: 'Is that actually a joke? They have both done f**ked up things in different ways'.  And although Kendall continued to defend Cait and fight for her right to make the invite list, the Kardashian matriarch wasn't convinced.  'No-one would know how to respond to her because of all the things,' she began to explain.  Kris' reasoning: 'No-one would know how to respond to her because of all the things,' she began to explain  She got the last word: As Kris, Kim and Khloe continued to explain how the situations were different and at the end of the day it was the momager's choice, Kourtney was the only one with the Vogue model's back  And the drama didn't end there with Kendall continuing to convince the family that no matter what had happened it was still the nice thing to do and the situation was no different to that of Scott's.  'So the f**k what? Why are we so worried about anyone else, even if she doesn't come it is the nice thing to do,' she said angrily.  Kris replied sassily: 'Oh, she would come.'

"Voluminous, wavy hair, an epic headband and red lips—these are the components of Wonder Woman's iconic beauty. Now that Isreali-born actress Gal Gadot has taken on the role of the superhero, we've been awaiting her interpretation of the DC Comics starring female.  ""Wonder Woman"" star Gal Gadot likes to paint her lips with strong colours. To no surprise, the previous Miss Israel has done justice to the role with her impactful, yet effortless, beauty.

I like strong lips,"" she said.  When she isn't defeating villains and being an overall badass, Gal prefers a sensible beauty routine, maintaining a classic look over the years.  Back in 2015, she said: ""I like to wear my hair up. It's very practical and I don't need to mess with it. Red lips and that's it!"""	0

At the close of 2016, plenty was up in the air, from the future of the country to what rapper Drake and multi-hyphenate Jennifer Lopez meant by posting his-and-her selfies on Instagram. Did the photos of them cuddling signify that they were dating, or were they just collaborating on new music? How much could one read into reports that they spent New Year’s together, and he was buying her at least one of the rocks that she got? And how did this all end so that she could embark on a new relationship with fellow New York City treasure Alex Rodriguez?  Loading View on Instagram  Now, there are some answers: Drake dropped his album More Life on Saturday night, and E.W. reports that Lopez is all over it, but not on it exactly. “Get It Together,” which first “leaked” to the public when TMZ published videos of J.Lo and Drake at a prom-themed party, dancing to the song, sounded as though it featured Lopez’s vocals. British singer Jorja Smith is the one singing on the final version, though.  More pointedly still, “Teenage Fever” samples the entire hook from “If You Had My Love,” Lopez’s 1999 hit from her first album, On the 6, but slows it down so it’s more somber. Is that a dig? Or is that the collaboration part that they were hinting at all along?  The most pointed reference to Jenny from the Block arrived on the opening track “Free Smoke,” in which he raps, “Miraval to the face” (i.e., Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s shared wine label that specializes in rosé), followed by, “I drunk text J. Lo / Old number so it bounce back.” How perfectly Drake that he learns he’s been rejected by Lopez via a passive number change while tipsy on rosé. Almost too Drake, really.  This was the problem all along. The stories circling these two were on the nose, a little too convenient for drumming up album excitement. Their matching intimate Instagrams arrived too suddenly with not enough confirmed clarity from either camp.  Loading View on Instagram  Drake’s feelings could be genuinely hurt, leading to him cutting Lopez out of the album. He also could have pivoted to fit the public narrative when nobody bought that they were together. Or the amount of J.Lo on the album now could have been the plan all along. We don’t know. But what we do know is that Lopez officially denied the relationship almost two weeks before More Life landed. During her Shades of Blue media blitz in early March, she told The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah, “Let me clear this up. I am not with Drake. Maybe that’s all I need to say.”  The next day was the Instagram double-tap heard round the world, and Page Six confirmed that Alex Rodriguez and Lopez were dating.  The tone of this relationship is more fitting and authentic. Lopez is neither hiding their time spent together—they’ve been seen out at dinner around Miami and in the Bahamas—nor is she promoting the new coupling on her own feeds.  On Saturday, right before More Life dropped, she arrived at the Yankee training camp in Florida to reportedly watch the retired Bronx bomber from a private box. By now, it’s very much, “Drake who?”  Vanity Fair has reached out to Lopez for comment on the album.	1
"Just remember kid... it's all BS. - Robert Mitchum to Nick Nolte at the Academy Awards    I live out here in Hollywood and have had my share of celebrities and their situational ethics and pretentious beliefs. Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.    Years ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated ""Hero's Journey..."" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.    Thank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.    Ken Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.  His catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or ""leap of faith"" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...  An amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.    Ken Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job ""is to report on the gamut of entertainment news..."", "" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars."" Who better qualified? I ask. You will actually learn something from Ken's book, and it might even contradict what you think about some of the celebrities he interviewed. If you've seen  Thomas Peter ""Tom"" Shadyac's ""I Am"" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.    Key takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, ""whatever gets you through the night,"" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:    ""I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is."""	0
"Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model and actress. Her years of success at modeling made her an international celebrity that has led to roles in television and film, and work as a spokesperson.  Early life [ edit ]  Cynthia Ann Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of John Daniel Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] as well as a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6] She has stated that her family has been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English, and French.[7] By appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included English nobility and continental royal families of the Middle Ages and that she was descended from Charlemagne.[8]  In her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modelling work, only to discover that it was a practical joke set up by two of her classmates. However, the following year another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week's coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford's first cover.[9] The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management's Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.  Crawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian.[10] She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one semester. She dropped out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to New York City in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.[11]  Career [ edit ]  During the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances.[12] Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Hervé Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy's).  In 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael's hit ""Freedom '90"" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of ""Please Come Home For Christmas"", ""John Taylor"" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran's ""Girl Panic"" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively).  The red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[13][14][15] In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some[who?] for being unsafe,[citation needed] it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.  The inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.[16]  Crawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall[1] with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34–25.5–36"".[17] Crawford's trademark is a mole (or ""beauty mark"") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she ""licked off"" her own mole.[18] During the beginning of her career, the mole was removed from her modeling pictures, including her first Vogue cover.[citation needed] Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as ""Baby Gia"".[19][20]  Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host of MTV's House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[21][22] In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi's Super Bowl commercial,[23] aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford.[23] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented ""In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.""[24] The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford's acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards - Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.[25]  In July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts.[26] In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts.[27]  Crawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world's sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy's list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine.[28] She was named No. 3 on VH1's 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the ""100 Hottest Women of All-Time"" by Men's Health.[29]  Fashion designer Michael Kors summed up her impact:  “ Cindy changed the perception of the ""sexy American girl"" from classic blue eyed blonde to a more sultry brunette with brains, charm, and professionalism to spare.[30] ”  After modeling [ edit ]  Crawford in October 2009  Crawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. She continues to provide celebrity endorsement for a variety of projects. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker.[31] Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28.[32]  In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the ""Cindy Crawford Home Collection"" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes.[33] She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.[34]  In 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication.[35]  Crawford returned to modeling in May 2011, appearing on the cover of the May 2011 issue of Vogue Mexico.[36]  Becoming, a book about Crawford's life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O'Leary, was published in September 2015.[37]  Crawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris.[38] In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy.[39]  In September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.[40]  Personal life [ edit ]  Crawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 to 1995. After they divorced, she married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998.[41] They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999)[42] and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001).[2][43] Both of her children went into modeling.[44][45]  Activism and charity work [ edit ]  When Crawford was 10 years old, her three-year-old brother Jeff—whom she continues to praise as ""the fourth most influential person in [her] life""—died of leukemia. Since becoming a model, Crawford has made childhood leukemia a focal point of her charity work, donating proceeds of her calendars to medical research.[46] Crawford has been a long-time supporter of the pediatric oncology program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Jeff was treated, stating that she believes he received the best care possible.[47] She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.[48]  In 2007, she became an official supporter of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC.[49] Crawford is on the honorary committee of the California Wildlife Center.[50]  Political endorsements [ edit ]  In 2008, Crawford endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. In 2011, she endorsed Mitt Romney.[51]  Filmography [ edit ]  Films [ edit ]  Videos [ edit ]  Fitness videos [ edit ]  Year Title 1992 Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body Workout 1993 Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge Workout 2000 Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension 2001 Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits  Music videos [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]"	1

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s love story plays out on the small screen in Lifetime’s Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, which premieres on Sunday night.  From their first blind date to their cozy kitchen engagement, the TV movie captured many of the couple’s milestone moments — and Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser’s uncanny resemblance to the real-life couple is worth a double take!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  But what was real and what was just for show? Here’s a breakdown of the show’s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead!  RELATED: Download PEOPLE’s The Story of Diana for intimate details, interviews with family and friends and exclusive home footage of Prince Harry and Prince William’s late mother  True: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother’s Death  The first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana’s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother’s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. “I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all,” Harry told Town & Country in 2017. “This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.”  Prince Philip, Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and Prince Charles walk outside Westminster Abbey during the funeral service for Princess Diana JEFF J. MITCHELL/AFP/Getty  False: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan  While it’s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry’s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. “Harry’s drinking days are over,” a source told PEOPLE. “All of his best friends have settled and had children, so he’s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.” Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: “He desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Owen Humphreys/PA Wire/AP  True: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial  The scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, “women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.” Meghan’s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from “Women all over America” to “People all over America.” And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, “People are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.” About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, “I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn’t right and something needed to be done.  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan Confirm They Will Uphold a ‘Very Important’ Tradition Involving the Wedding Dress!  True: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date  The newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. “It was definitely a set-up — it was a blind date,” Harry said during the couple’s revealing engagement interview. “It was a blind date for sure.” And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was “nice.” “I didn’t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was – I had one question, I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind it just didn’t – it didn’t seem like it would make sense,” Meghan said during their interview.  True: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana  Unlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn’t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry’s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. “It was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” Harry said of their whirlwind romance. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry in Botswana Rhino Conservation Botswana/ Kensington Palace/Getty  False: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan  In the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren’t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan’s future in-laws have always been in the couple’s corner. “She’s been wonderful,” Meghan said of Kate after the couple’s engagement. Harry added: “Amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.” Meghan, who will be learning on the job, “is funny and serious and extremely hard-working,” a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. “I can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  False: Meghan Wasn’t Invited to Pippa Middleton’s Wedding Reception  While it’s true that Meghan didn’t receive an invite to Pippa’s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding — even if it was the post-church nighttime bash — was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious.  True: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch  While it didn’t happen at Pippa’s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen’s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen’s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be “blackamoor” jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan’s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) — and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Princess Michael of Kent Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty  True: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets  Just like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting “his and hers” jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress’s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket.  Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty; Megan Markle/Instagram  True: Meghan Met the Queen  During Meghan and Prince Harry’s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. “It’s incredible,” Meghan said about meeting the Queen. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She’s an incredible woman.” Harry then added: “The corgis took to her straight away. ‘I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at — this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: “They were laying on my feet during tea!”  False: Harry’s Public Statement Led to a Breakup  While the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry’s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn’t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released.  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Alexi Lubomirski/REX/Shutterstock  False: A Member of Harry’s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan  The character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn’t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public.  True: Meghan’s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry  Trevor Engelson, Meghan’s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar — because it’s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level,” according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson — who also works on FX’s Snowfall — and Dan Farah, another one of the show’s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, “It should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.”  Queen Charlotte Indianapolis Museum of Art /Getty Images  True: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal  Although it’s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She’s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn’t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely.	0

"A MAN marrying a stranger on a reality TV show was so disappointed by his new wife's appearance that he muttered ""oh s**t"" the moment she appeared at the top of the aisle.  Aussie Sean D, 38, was saying I Do to a total stranger on Married At First Sight, a programme that sees total strangers meeting at the altar after being paired up for life by a team of scientists and psychologists.  Channel 9 6 Sean D muttered ""oh s**t"" when he first locked eyes on his new bride  But while single mum Jo, 39, was thrilled with her new hubby - later exclaiming ""Jackpot! I've won the lotto!"" - he had a face like thunder for the entire ceremony and the reception.  Things even took a further dive when after kissing his new missus, he wiped her lipstick off his mouth and said ""gross"".  Speaking to The Fix, Sean shared the criteria he had given producers for his dream partner.  He said: ""Someone who’s funny. Someone’s who loyal. Someone who wants to have good fun. Having someone to go and have fun with and do different things and learn different things. And someone who's trustworthy.""  Channel 9 6 He was unable to hide his disappointment, although he was matched with someone who was 100% his type on paper  Channel 9 6 Jo was delighted to see her hunky new husband and said she felt like she had won the lottery  But despite Jo ticking all the boxes, he simply didn't fancy her.  Sadly for Jo, she really did think she had struck gold with her mystery man.  At the wedding she said: ""He's got kind eyes. He seems genuine. I fancy him.  ""This could work. My expectations have been met and then some. To infinity and beyond... Sean D and Jo sitting in a tree.  Channel 9 6 Jo couldn't stop talking about how good looking her new man was  ""My expectations have been met, and then some. To infinity and beyond. Winning! Jackpot! I've won the lotto!  ""The experts have been spot on! He is for me. He couldn't be any more perfect.""  But Sean felt very differently, which made for awkward viewing for people at home.  He said, ""Um, she's probably not what I imagined, no.  Channel 9 6 Later Sean looked despondently at the table as Jo stared at him adoringly  ""There's not like a massive spark straight away, but I'm sure she's feeling the same way.""  People tuned in at home were on the edge of their seats as the mismatched pair continued to totally misread one another's body language and reactions to each other.  All I really wanna watch is Jo & that sad sack Sean #MAFS — DeluxeStormBorn™ (@deluxe_tm) January 31, 2018  However, Sean has since explained his frosty reaction to likeable Jo - it's all because of his exercise addict ex-girlfriend who he's still a bit hung up on.  He said that after she got addicted to exercise, their 10 year relationship ended and he was stuck caring for their plethora of pets including llamas and cats - and he is still traumatised and tired.  Sean said: ""We had a five-acre property together, and she ran out of time for me and the animals.  Channel 9 6 Sean later described kissing his wife as ""gross""  ""It was really hard because I had to take responsibility of the farm. I got all the animals. When we broke up, we had nine dogs, two alpacas, and two horses.  ""It was difficult breaking up, it wasn't like either of us did anything wrong - there was no cheating or anything like that.  ""She became a fitness freak but was just crazy. We slowly drifted apart and that was it, we were done.""

"Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, and former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is an American-born member of the British royal family and a former film and television actress.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed-race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best-known role, Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.  Early life and education  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her ""dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.""[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Proctor & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a ""briefcase girl"" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: ""Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.""[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and ""actively re-positioned"" her character from ingenue to ""the show's moral conscience"" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her ""desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings"".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was ""Tig Talk"", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked ""everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years"".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as ""aspirational girl next door"", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and separated through a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55]  Markle was in a relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello for almost two years.[56] They lived together in their residence in Toronto.[57] Their relationship ended in May 2016.[56]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[58][59] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[60] Markle and Prince Harry met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] The press began to report on the relationship in October 2016.[62] On November 8, 2016, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[63] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[64][65][66] During a September 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke in public for the first time about her love for Prince Harry.[67] Later that month, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[68][69]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, where the show is filmed.[70] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[71]  Markle has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd named Bogart and a beagle named Guy, whom she adopted in 2012 and 2015 respectively.[72][73]  Royal marriage  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017.[58][74] By then, she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's paternal grandmother, several times.[75] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[76] The ring Harry gave Markle consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[77] Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[78][79] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[80]  In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[81] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[81] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[82] The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[83]  Public life  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[84][85] in connection with World AIDS Day.[86] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[87] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[86] Cardiff,[88] Goldsmiths' Hall,[89] and Edinburgh.[90] On February 28, 2018, Markle attended an official

Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis dropped a bombshell on this season of the Bravo series, when she revealed she and her castmate Shep Rose had been secretly hooking up through the years.  So, during an appearance on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‘sexy times’ with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob’s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show.  If you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal until Kathryn revealed on this season that they had hooked up a few more times over the years.  First, Andy asked Shep who initiated their hookups again.  “Well, we met at one of my bars. And we had a couple of drinks and it was just like on fire again,” said Shep.  The question then turned to the number of times Shep and Kathryn have hooked up over the years.  “Total? Probably like six or seven,” he revealed. “Originally, I was [her booty call]. We were each other’s booty calls. Then she fell back with Whitney [Sudler-Smith] and Thomas, and I was like ‘no, no, no.'”  Andy also wanted to know if the two go out on dates first before hooking up. “No, no,” laughed Shep, adding: “But I would go on a date with her!”  Shep was then asked if anyone on the cast was aware of his secret hookups with Kathryn before it was revealed on the show this year.  “Well, yeah because I kind of stole her from Craig. Craig was courting her but he slept in her bed two nights in a row and didn’t try anything. And I was like ‘what are you doing?’ so I was like I’ll try some things,” he stated , giving female fans of the show once more reason to love Craig !  Finally, Shep was questioned about Thomas’s girlfriend Ashley, who has received a TON of backlash this season due to the way she has treated Kathryn, which includes calling her an “egg donor.” According to Shep, what viewers saw on the show is actually tame in comparison to what actually went down during the cast’s drama-filled vacation.  “She was so emboldened and walking around like she owned the place, when what she should have been doing is ‘hey, I’m really sorry about last night’ because we were having a good time on Daufuskie Island,” said Shep. “We were eating well and drinking well, and she said some things that were so inappropriate.”  He added, “the audience doesn’t even know the half of what she actually said.”  Shep also wondered why Thomas has yet to break up with Ashley, stating Thomas “would have all the support in the world if he said no thank you” to his relationship.

Rose McGowan, Bette Midler, and Corey Feldman were among the celebrities and media figures who weighed in on Wednesday’s news that longtime “Today” show host Matt Lauer has been fired from NBC News following sexual harassment allegations.  McGowan, a central figure in the Harvey Weinstein scandal, tweeted, “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out, Matt Lauer.”  Feldman recently sat down for an interview with Lauer on “Today,” where the actor promised to expose a pedophile ring in Hollywood.

As for the veracity of the rest of the rumor, who knows?    Rihanna and Jameel have kept their relationship very private, and Rihanna has never posted anything about Jameel on her social media. In January, the two had a rare outing together and were photographed leaving a Grammys after party...apart but around the same time. They just didn't want to be photographed next to each other.

"Now that she's become a celebrity in her own right, Paris Jackson is a modern-day tabloid fixture. With that, unfortunately, comes having every aspect of her life analyzed. Her relationship status and dating life are part of that, and when a recent report surfaced that alleged Jackson was dating three women at once, the daughter of the pop icon Michael Jackson took it upon herself to set the record straight.  After Gossip Cop published a report refuting that Jackson was dating three women at the same time—Cara Delevingne , Ashley Benson , and Caroline D'Amore, according to The National Enquirer —Jackson's rep also denied it all, saying, ""No idea how or why they come up with this stuff. Definitely not true.” Jackson later hopped on Twitter to echo that statement, tweeting, ""I’ve never met miss benzo. Caroline is one of my bestest friends who is **straight** and **married**, and also the mother of my godchild. Cara and I were never officially exclusive, you guys made that up.""  The report, which said “things could get quite nasty if Paris doesn’t choose one of these girls to date exclusively,” is the kind of fan-fiction that has become an annoying reality for celebrities who don't adhere to heteronormative sexuality. Delevingne, who has spoken out about not wanting to be ""pigeonholed"" before, has also dealt with overzealous tabloid coverage of her love life.  Just last month, after Delevingne was seen holding hands with Benson as they walked around New York City wearing matching backpacks, some speculated that the pair were an item. Fueling that rumor, or trolling it, or both, Benson later shared the photo on her Instagram, writing, ""Cute cute cute.""  Loading View on Instagram  As for D’Amore, it's somewhat of a mystery how she became entangled in this rumor. The DJ has been married to her husband, Bobby Alt, since 2012, and the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, Isabella Viking Alt, back in 2015. As Jackson noted, she's the godmother of their child. The women have flaunted their friendship on social media for quite some time now, with D'Amore recently thanking Jackson on Instagram for her friendship, writing, ""Words don’t do this friendship justice but you know how much I love you. Thank you for supporting me as always @parisjackson."" So take it all with a big grain of salt."	0

"Kylie Jenner was spotted out and about with two giant, sparkly diamond rings on her ring finger and everyone's all, ""ooooooh she's engaged to Travis Scott!"" BUT IS SHE??  First, let's look at the evidence — which is just this picture that the paps snapped while Kylie was out and about with bestie Jordyn Woods on Saturday afternoon.  BACKGRID  Kylie also shared some video of the rings:  And uh... that's all the evidence we have.  Back in early March, Kylie sparked rumors that she was engaged when she wore a band on her ring finger, but that turned out just to be a ring. OR WAS IT?!  What's more, Kylie appears to have worn these exact diamond rings before!?  So what's the deal — has she been engaged for months, or is she just messing with us? Or does she just like RINGS? Which is possible, rings are dope.  Rumors have been around that the couple would get married ever since people started speculating that Kylie was pregnant, but sources close to the couple told People that they weren't planning on marry any time soon.  On Valentine's Day, another family friend shared the same thoughts. “Despite being new parents, Kylie and Travis are still in a new relationship too. Kylie is happy with their living situation,” the source said. “Travis is a great dad. When he wants to work, Kylie is supportive.”  So there you have it! They're not engaged! Unless they maybe are! Only time (and also, an Instagram post from both of them) will tell!"	0
"Only in crumbling old tabloids do we tend to remember the starter husbands married to a celebrity in the earliest aughts of her career. You know, the Jordan Bratmans or Jason Alexanders of the world, the men that even back then we were like, ""Seriously?"" Luckily if you're a pop sensation you're probably able to bury those memories with crystal bodysuits, Las Vegas residencies, and two or three other marriages. But we're here, armed with a shovel, to recount those cringe-worthy short-lived couplings.  But how do these mismatched pairings happen to such powerful, beautiful ladies? Do they occur when they're a young, impressionable starlet who's swept off their feet by music, ala Mariah Carey? Or a plastered, impulsive 4 am a decision like Britney Spears? Seriously, how is it, when you're putting out Billboard-charting records, do you end up making that mistake? We get being a slave to your insecurities, we can barely boil an egg let alone put out something as iconic as ""Oops...I Did It Again.""

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Scott Stump  At this kind of party, everyone is a pooper.  Steve Martin, 72, and Martin Short, 68, revealed on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" Tuesday that they have ""colonoscopy parties"" every other year with Tom Hanks, 61, and fellow friend Walter Parks to have some fun ahead of the procedure.  ""We’re very excited,'' Short said. ""We go to Steve’s house around 5 p.m. the night before. We call it 'Colonoscopy Eve' in Canada.""  They go through the process of avoiding solid foods, consuming liquids and clearing their bowels to get ready.  ""And it’s catered,'' Martin said. ""There’s Jell-O, you know, there’s not much you can (eat). You have to purge all day and then we toast.""  ""We thought, everybody at our age ... at a certain age, you want to get a colonoscopy,"" Martin said. ""We all came over, we played poker and we watched some funny movie and you drink all this stuff.""  Walter Parks, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Tom Hanks. The group joked about throwing ""colonoscopy parties."" Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube  Short also joked about the portion of the party that isn't so fun.  ""What’s shocking is with Steve, you know, he’s a wealthy man,'' he said. ""Who would think he would have one bathroom? I mean, by 10 p.m., the bathroom looks like Day 14 of a Carnival cruise.""  ""I thought the bathroom ended up looking like a Jackson Pollock,"" Martin added.  The four friends share one car on the ride to get their colonoscopies the next day, playing cards to determine who has to go last for his exam, the duo said.  ""It was fun,'' Martin said about the party. ""It's a great way to do something that you should do.""  The colonoscopy crew: Martin, Hanks and Short. Jokes aside, men should start getting colonoscopies starting at age 45. Getty Images  Kimmel himself has also been an advocate for raising awareness of the importance of getting colonoscopies. Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cancer death for men and women combined.  He celebrated turning 50 this year by having former TODAY anchor Katie Couric walk him through the process and go through the results in a hilarious scene while also stressing the importance of the exam. Couric's first husband, Jay Monahan died at 42 of colon cancer in 1998.  The legendary comedians correctly noted to Kimmel on Tuesday that colon cancer screenings should start at 45 instead of 50 under new guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society last month.  Colonoscopy parties don't need to be as frequent as every other year like those of the four friends. People who are in good health with no increased risk should have a colonoscopy every 10 years, according to the American Cancer Society.  If you’re at increased or high risk of colorectal cancer (or think you might be), talk to your health care provider to learn more. Your provider can suggest the best screening option for you, as well as determine what type of screening schedule you should follow, based on your individual risk.

Does Brad Pitt have a new woman in his life?  The actor, 54, has been spending time with Neri Oxman, an architect and professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab, according to Page Six TV.  Pitt and Oxman connected over their shared love of design and architecture, and their relationship “is best described as a professional friendship,” a source told the outlet. While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is “interested in spending more time” with Oxman.  A rep for the actor declined to comment to PageSix, but a friend of Pitt’s told the outlet that the two are “just friends.”  The duo reportedly met through an MIT architecture project. While the nature of the project is unknown, Pitt is a noted architecture enthusiast and founded the Make It Right Foundation, which builds affordable and environmentally friendly homes in New Orleans for people in need.

She was previously married to Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov. According to her MIT profile, Oxman “coined the term, and pioneered the field of, Material Ecology, which considers computation, fabrication, and the material itself as inseparable dimensions of design. In this approach, products and buildings are biologically informed and digitally engineered by, with and for, nature.”  Pitt has been mostly keeping a low profile since his September 2016 split from Angelina Jolie. The duo have been negotiating over the terms of their divorce and custody of their six kids — Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.

"Ben Affleck’s new home is just a stone’s throw from the one he used to share with his soon-to-be ex-wife.  The “Live By Night” actor has reportedly purchased a $19.2 million mansion in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, and it’s located under half a mile from Jennifer Garner’s house down the road, according to x17online.  HARVEY WEINSTEIN UNLOADS MANHATTAN TOWNHOUSE FOR $25 MILLION  A source for E! News says Affleck was eyeing homes in the area in order to be closer to the three children he shares with Garner. The site also reports that Affleck has already brought Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9 and Sam, 5, to tour the house this past weekend.  ""He was looking for a long time and really wanted to find the right house for his family,” a source for E! stated.  TAYLOR SWIFT'S NEIGHBORS NOT HAPPY ABOUT LIVING SO CLOSE  According to online listings, the home features seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two half-baths, in addition to its own private screening room, a gym and a wine cellar. There’s also a guest house and pool out back, along with an outdoor entertaining area.  Affleck and his girlfriend, “SNL” producer Lindsay Shookus, had also been by to check out the property prior to Affleck’s purchase, People reports. A source for the site, however, had said in October 2017 that Affleck and Shookus were not looking to buy a house together, as Affleck focused on “family friendly” options for the kids.  FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS  Affleck and Garner announced their separation in 2015, after just over 10 years of marriage. Affleck reportedly maintained a residence in the family’s guest house before moving out in May 2017. The pair officially filed divorce petitions a few weeks earlier in April 2017."	0

"In the absence of one Donald Trump , who hosted a rally for himself in Michigan in lieu of attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner Saturday night, the MC and comedian Michelle Wolf declined to, as they say, take any prisoners. “Like a porn star says when she’s about to have sex with Trump, let’s get this over with,” Wolf said, opening her remarks. It was the president’s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents’ Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN’s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981—then recovering from an attempted assassination.)  Among the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents’ Dinner—for, it seems, they weren’t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally—as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe ’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast—but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf’s jokes about Trump’s wealth (“Mr. President, I don’t think you’re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you’re doing fine”) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.  Sanders was reportedly seated in Wolf’s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: “I loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid’s Tale ,” Wolf said to her. “I’m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what’s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.”  The New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders’s seeming gameness for taking the criticism—“That @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,” she wrote on Twitter—a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents’ Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf’s speech), said, “Washington is so thin-skinned .” (She would know .) Celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf’s performance—though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.  But there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf's own, in response to Sean Spicer's tweet that ""Tonight's #WHCD was a disgrace."" ""Thank you!"" she responded.  Also, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn’t have water."	1
Kendra Wilkinson Baskett is opening up about the problems that she is currently facing in her marriage.  The Kendra on Top star took to Instagram Wednesday, when she admitted that she and her husband, Hank Baskett, “are having issues” and denied that their “marital problems” are made up for cameras.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “1. how do u fake marital problems? makes absolutely no sense,” Kendra, 32, began the post, which accompanied a screenshot of an article titled, “Made-Up Marriage Problems?! Kendra’s Faking It for TV.”  “2. Yes we are having issues,” she continued. “3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what i wanted but was a part of my journey and story.”  In a fifth point, Kendra shared that “these issues Hank n I are having in our home which we are tryin to hard to over come, everyone knows about, including producers and network, friends and family.”  “6. My job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions cuz the last thing i want to do is hurt Hank,” she shared. “7. I hope to get back to the fun Kendra you all know. That’s all i want n aim for. I hate drama!!!”  She concluded by thanking fans for their “support and understanding me at this time. I’ve been in a lot of therapy lately n hope all gets resolved for me, Hank,kids and even for TV. Lol 😂”    The couple wed in 2009 and have welcomed two children — son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah, 3 — over the course of their marriage, which was rocked by a scandal four years ago.  In 2014, Hank allegedly had an affair with a transgender model while Kendra was eight months pregnant. But despite the cheating scandal, the two have remained committed to one another.  “We’re different people than we were years ago,” Kendra told PEOPLE in April 2017. “You know, you change. But you have to change together. You have to grow together, not apart, and that’s the challenge.”  “Right now we’re in the healthiest place we’ve ever been,” she said. “It’s all about each other. We want to help build each other and love each other and make sure we’re happy. When we went through our big issue that was scattered everywhere, it needed to happen.”  “Unfortunately, it was a really rough situation,” she added. “But I’m a very faithful person and I think it really worked out for the best.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendra’s Ultimatum! Wilkinson Threatens to Cut Mom Off From Her Kids Over Exposé: ‘There’s No Coming Back’  Last summer, Kendra shared about how she and Hank were keeping their marriage strong while temporarily living long-distance.  “We’re dealing with a long-distance relationship right now. We have to communicate a lot,” she told E! News. “We’re eight years in a our marriage now, so communication is what we have to hang on to right now to keep our relationship strong.”	0

So, are the Beckhams divorcing? Rumors about trouble in David and Victoria’s marriage have been proliferating in the tabloids since the Royal Wedding, where the couple was photographed looking dour. Of course, there are always rumors about the Beckhams, who will (hopefully?) celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary on July 4. This time, though, social-media participants seem convinced that they are really heading for a split.  There are a few factors to consider when weighing the possibility of divorce. One is: Do you care? Another is: What have the Beckhams said about their marriage? (It’s F-I-N-E, according to their publicist, who called the rumors “Journalist Chinese whispers and fake news fueled by social media.”) And another is: What’s going on with the Beckhams’ businesses?  Last week, the Daily Mail reported that David left his longtime manager, who also manages Posh, for a new team led by his friend David Gardner. This, to me, would be the strongest sign of an impending split, but the Beckhams quickly denied the report. Then, Victoria gave a speech at the Forbes Women Summit in New York, where she mentioned David specifically and called him an “incredible husband.”  “I try really, really hard. I try hardest to be the best mother,” she said in her speech, according to People. “I am trying to be the best wife and the best professional. When I get home I try to put the phone down and spend time with the children and spend time with David. I have the support of an incredible husband. We really are equal with everything we do at home with the children. When I’m away he’s the one doing the school run and doing the cooking.”  So Victoria is trying. Is David? So far, he hasn’t personally said anything about the divorce rumors. I’d wait to see what he does next week for their anniversary.  In other celebrity relationship news, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are doing great. Shookus’s parents visited the couple in L.A. this past weekend, and they all went on a dinner date and a hike the next day. (Shookus’s 5-year-old daughter was present for the hike, too.) According to an “eyewitness” who talked to People, Affleck was in a “great mood” at dinner, and he “picked up the check at the end of the night.”  Photo: Juliano-rol/X17online.com  But Affleck and Shookus are not necessarily getting more serious, according to Entertainment Tonight. A source close to Affleck told the outlet, “Ben knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He’s actually been told to take it slow and he’s heeding that advice … Ben isn’t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon, but Lindsay feels he is worth the wait.”  What do you think? Is Ben Affleck worth the wait?  Moving more quickly is Shookus’s SNL colleague Pete Davidson, who just moved into a $16 million apartment in Manhattan with his new fiancé, Ariana Grande. Grande’s 25th birthday is today, and Davidson wished her a happy birthday on Instagram just after midnight.  Last night, Grande posted a photo of Davidson on her Instagram story at 11:11 p.m. with the caption, “i have no wish i have everything i ever wanted hi.” I love it!  Do you remember who Chris Martin is dating? It’s Dakota Johnson. They were photographed walking a dog in Malibu on Sunday.  Photo: DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID  One small blessing from this week:  Martin’s ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is preparing to marry her fiancé, the television producer Brad Falchuk at the end of the summer. Here’s what she had to say about wedding planning this time around:  “I’m very busy so I’m actually not that involved in it.”  Photo: XPOS/BACKGRID  And here’s an interesting blind item from this week, from Enty at Crazy Days and Nights:  “This former A- list mostly television actress from a now defunct hit comedy is probably A-/B+ list mostly movie actress. She says that this A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know spent three weeks chatting her up and doing everything he could to hook up with her. She finally hooked up with him and within 30 minutes after, he had her out the door and has ghosted her since.”  I believe that “A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know” has moved on with an even younger actress.  Finally, I’ll leave you with some incredible news: Emma Watson is back together with former Glee star Chord Overstreet. Or perhaps they never broke up? They first announced their relationship back in March, with a very obvious pap stroll in L.A.. Then, People reported at the end of May that they were over. But last week, they were pap-strolling in L.A. again, and this time, they made out for the camera! Watson must really like this guy to go along with all of this.  Thanks so much for gossiping this week. Don’t forget to email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal, if you’d like to chat.	1
As more women share their stories of sexual assault amid the staggering number of accusations against producer Harvey Weinstein, actress Laura Dern realized that she had been justifying experiences she had as a teenager as “the norm.”  Dern, 50, spoke with Ellen DeGeneres in an interview set to air Wednesday about being honored at ELLE magazine’s Women in Hollywood Awards Monday. At the event, women spoke about sexual abuse they’ve faced in their lives.  Dern’s “Big Little Lies” co-star Reese Witherspoon revealed she was sexually assaulted by a director when she was just 16; Jennifer Lawrence recalled being made to stand in a “degrading” nude lineup for an audition.  “It was an extraordinary experience, perhaps more than ever, to have this shared space and a tribe of women and artists talking about this industry, and ultimately therefore talking about sexual harassment in the workplace,” Dern said.  The actress told DeGeneres she had a revelation Tuesday morning, realizing she, too, had been “justifying behavior” that was not OK.  Stefanie Keenan via Getty Images  “ ... I talked about how I was one of the lucky ones because I was raised by actors who told me their stories and told me what to look out for, and I realized that I was I still justifying behavior,” she said. “And it was my mom who said, ‘No, no, no, Laura, that was sexual assault. That was harassment. That was assault. No, you were 14 then.’ And you realize how in our culture we have justified, and therefore even condoned, behavior as though it’s the norm. I felt very moved by people being honest and direct.”  Dern said that for her the “most exciting” part is moving forward through action, including the possible formation of a commission where woman can report ― even anonymously ― abuses of power.

Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he’s done playing Wolverine, will we finally get to see “fat Jackman?”  Jackman has been playing Wolverine since 1999, and it’s been seventeen years that he’s had to stay in peak physical condition so that he could perform shirtless scenes for the movies. Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.  One of us! One of us! One of us!  Logan is in theaters now.  (Last Updated )	1

Expanding their brood! Seth Meyers’ wife, Alexi Ashe, is pregnant and expecting the couple’s second child together.  Meyers announced the news on Thursday, November 23, during the Thanksgiving episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, alongside his parents, Larry and Hilary Meyers, and his brother Josh, who were his guests on the show.  “I want to take this opportunity now, you guys obviously know, my wife and I are expecting a second baby,” the late-night host said. “Very excited. Thank you! Very excited.”  His mother told the audience the story of when her son called her to give her the good news. “I get the phone call, and my Seth is sometimes a crier. He’s sobbing,” she said. “He said, ‘Because for over a month, I’ve had to pretend that I don’t care what sex it is and I do care, I want a little boy!’”  The comedian, who welcomed his first son Ashe in 2016, said: “That’s true, I really wanted a brother for my son because I was so lucky to have one.”  The Saturday Night Live alum, 43, and the human rights lawyer announced their first pregnancy in September 2015 while attending New York’s Natural History Museum Gala.  “They are so thrilled to become parents and were so happy to share the exciting news with friends and cast members from SNL last night,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.  The couple wed in September 2013 in front of family and friends at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Although the late-night host typically holds back from commenting on his marriage, he did share a sweet memory back in 2014 of Ashe trying on her wedding gown.  “I will never forget the first time she returned from her fitting because she was happier than I’ve ever seen her,” Meyers gushed at the time while attending a NYC luncheon. “Which was a little jarring for me because I had recently proposed to her. Turns out getting a ring from me is less exciting than having Carolina Herrera creating your dress.”  The Late Night With Seth Meyers host also poked fun at Ashe for having food poising the night before their nuptials. “In a testament to my wife’s will and my wife’s strength, she got herself pumped full of fluids, and she railed it and made it to the ceremony,” he said. “When she walked out in her Herrera wedding dress, she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her look.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

In the months since President Donald Trump took office, his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has become one of his father’s most vocal supporters — and Twitter defenders.  The president returned the favor on Tuesday and Wednesday, coming to his son’s defense after his namesake seemingly embroiled himself more deeply in the ongoing Russian collusion investigation by releasing emails detailing how he eagerly set up a meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who allegedly promised damaging information on his father’s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.  “My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,” the president said in a statement delivered by his principal deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, at an off-camera press briefing Tuesday afternoon.  Trump followed up on Twitter early Wednesday, praising his son’s interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity overnight. Trump Jr. admitted during the show that “in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”  “My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!” Trump tweeted.  Trump Jr., 39, first emerged as one of father’s fiercest defenders during the presidential campaign — and before that worked side-by-side with his dad while running the family business — but the pair haven’t always been as close are they are today.  Ron Galella, Ltd./WireImage  As a preteen, Trump Jr.’s relationship with his father was fraught following Trump’s separation from his first wife, Ivana Trump, the mother of eldest children Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.  Trump Jr. was 12 at the time and didn’t speak to his father for a year after the highly publicized split, New York magazine reported in a 2004 article about the Trump children.  Trump Jr. told the magazine that at the time he blamed the divorce on his father, who had been having an affair with model Marla Maples. But he added that in retrospect he may have been “manipulated” into that belief by his mother.  “Listen, it’s tough to be a 12-year-old. You’re not quite a man, but you think you are. You think you know everything. Being driven into school every day and you see the front page and it’s divorce! THE BEST SEX I EVER HAD! And you don’t even know what that means,” he said, referencing the heavy gossip-column coverage of his parents’ split, some of which was encouraged by his father.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Ron Galella/WireImage  After his parents’ divorce, Trump Jr. and his brother Eric were shipped off to boarding school, the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, to remove them from the New York society scene, according to Vanity Fair.  At school, Trump Jr. practiced skeet shooting, and — unlike his father — seemed to enjoy life outside the spotlight.  “When I went to boarding school, it all kind of went away — all those inconveniences that I found intrusive,” he told New York in 2004.  Andrew Savulich/NY Daily News Archive/Getty  Trump Jr. also told The New York Times in March that he decided early on not to measure himself against his father.  ”I think people are often surprised, but I never defined myself as, ‘I’m the business guy who has to supersede what my father has done,’ ” he said. ”He’s a totally unique individual. Somehow having to top his accomplishments is never the way I perceived things.”  As a child, Trump Jr. found a role model not in his father but in his maternal grandfather, Milos Zelnicek, an electrician and avid outdoorsman. In the summers, Trump Jr. stayed at his grandparents’ home outside Prague for six to eight weeks at a time, where his grandfather taught him how to camp, fish, hunt and speak Czech, the Times reported.  ”He needed a father figure,” Ivana told the newspaper in a telephone interview. ”Donald was not around that much. They would have to go to his office to say hello to him before going to school.” (Ivana also once hinted at her ex-husband’s alleged barely-there parenting by saying: “When [my children] turned 21, I handed them over to him and said, ‘Here’s the finished product.’ “)  RELATED VIDEO: Donald Trump Jr. Changes Account of Russian Lawyer Meeting  Trump Jr. went on to attend father’s alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was by all accounts (including his own) a big partier who “had a reputation” for getting into “drunken, ‘do-you-have-any-idea-who-I-am?’ fights,” according to New York.  Vanity Fair reported that Scott Melker, a Penn classmate, wrote on Facebook, “Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around on campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking. He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him.”  Melker also described an alleged incident in which Trump showed up to his son’s dorm room to take him to a Yankees game. Trump Jr. was dressed in a Yankees jersey and when he opened the door to his father, “without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said, ‘Put on a suit and meet me outside,’ and closed the door.” A spokesperson for the Trump family told Vanity Fair this story is “completely false.”  After graduating, Trump Jr. initially declined to join the family business, instead moving to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, camped, lived out of the back of a truck, and bartended, according to Vanity Fair — which also reported that Trump Jr. stopped talking to his father during this time.  RELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: Natasha Stoynoff Speaks Out: ‘I Don’t Want Women to Feel Afraid’  Several months later, on Feb. 25, 2001, Trump Jr. was arrested for public drunkenness during a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans. He spent 11 hours in jail.  Like his teetotaler father, Trump Jr. no longer drinks. But he attributes this not to inspiration from his father but rather to the discipline of the sporting life. ”I know that the benefits I got from being in the woods, from being in a duck blind, from being in a tree stand at 5 o’clock in the morning, kept me out of so much other trouble I would have gotten into in my life,” Trump Jr. said in a speech at a 2016 fundraiser.  After returning from Aspen in 2001, Trump Jr. went to work at the Trump Organization, where he climbed the ranks to executive vice president. During his first big project, the Trump Park Avenue, he clashed with his father on the decor (the elder Trump insisted on gold doorknobs), The Washington Post reported. After the project was completed, Trump Jr. jokingly asked his father to put “Trump Junior” on the facade, but his father refused.  In 2003, Trump introduced his son to his future wife, former model Vanessa Haydon, at a fashion show. Trump proposed with a ring from the Bailey, Banks & Biddle jewelry store in Short Hills, New Jersey, in exchange for publicity, and was later mocked in the New York Post, which ran the story with the headline: ”Trump Jr. Is the Cheapest Gazillionaire: Heirhead Proposes With Free 100G Ring.” (The couple went on to have five children, now between the ages of 10 and 3.)  According to Vanity Fair, Trump also publicly criticized his son at the time, saying on CNN’s Larry King Live: ”You have a name that is hot as a pistol, you have to be very careful with things like this.”  Ethan Miller/Getty  Despite their sometimes-rocky relationship, Trump Jr. has been nothing but supportive since his father launched his presidential bid, joining him on the campaign trail and using Twitter to lash out at his father’s many critics.  Trump Jr.’s interest in hunting and close friendships with gun enthusiasts and people who enjoy the outdoors — so foreign from the New York elite world his father long operated in — have endeared him to some conservatives and to his father’s Middle America supporters while also riling animal rights activists who criticized his big game hunting trips in Africa.

Though it may not seem like it based on his politics-focused Twitter activity, Trump Jr. maintains that his focus these days is on running the Trump Organization. He has claimed several times that he has barely spoken to his father since he took office in January.  In March, amid criticism that his father had not sufficiently removed himself from his businesses, Trump Jr. said at a GOP fundraiser that he’d had virtually ”zero contact” with the president since the election. He insisted to The New York Times later that month, ”I haven’t spoken to him. Maybe just to say hello. It feels trite. I feel ridiculous bothering him.”  Critics were quick to point out that Trump Jr. had recently joined his father for his announcement of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil M. Gorsuch in late January.  “Where is the break point?” Trump Jr. said when asked about this by the Times. ”If I see him once a month, is that too much? Once a year? My point is, it’s a no-win scenario. But, in the end, we both fully recognize that what he is doing now is far more important than absolutely anything going on in the business. And we will conduct ourselves accordingly.”  Now, Trump Jr. has a much bigger issue to worry about as he faces widespread criticism, allegations of treason and potential legal troubles over his June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. There’s a growing call for Trump Jr. to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his email exchange on the meeting, which he said he’d be “happy” to do.  Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know. https://t.co/tL47NOoteM — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017  The fallout from the revelation that Trump Jr. met with the Russian lawyer (who has since denied any alleged ties to the Russian government) has prompted critics to say that the businessman has never seemed more like his father’s son.  .@DonaldJTrumpJr is a great example of the maxim that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. https://t.co/IFjNh5wMY9 — Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) July 10, 2017  Like father, like son (and son-in-law) https://t.co/8qhVOFUjjO — VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) July 11, 2017  Where there's smoke there's fire.

Nick Cannon says he’s leaving as host of NBC’s America’s Got Talent after he learned network execs were considering firing him over a racial joke he told in his Showtime comedy special. Stand Up, Don’t Shoot, described as a stand-up special in which Cannon takes on race and other topics, premiered Friday on Showtime.  “After days of deliberating over some extremely disappointing news that I was being threatened with termination by Executives because of a comedy special that was only intended to bring communities closer together, I was to be punished for a joke,” he writes on Instagram and Facebook. “This has weighed heavy on my spirit. It was brought to my attention by my “team” that NBC believed that I was in breach of contract because I had disparaged their brand. In my defense, I would ask how so? Or is this just another way to silence and control an outspoken voice who often battles the establishment.”  What Cannon is referring to is a fairly standard clause in employment contracts that does not allow an employee to disparage the company they work for. He goes on to say,” I find myself in a dark place having to make a decision that I wish I didn’t have to, but as a man, an artist, and a voice for my community I will not be silenced, controlled or treated like a piece of property. There is no amount of money worth my dignity or my integrity. I have loved hosting AMERICAS GOT TALENT for the last 8 seasons, watching talented, brave, and courageous Americans accomplish their dreams in front of millions has been nothing but a joy, and everyone has been a pleasure to work with but my soul won’t allow me to be in business with corporations that attempt to frown on freedom of speech, censor artists, and question cultural choices.”  Deadline has reached out to NBC for comment.	1
"We've heard a lot about Wyatt and Dimitri Kutcher—like how Wyatt had a poop explosion all over dad, or how Dimitri is his parents' biggest fan. But we've never actually seen the daughter and son of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. On a recent podcast, Kutcher explained why.  “My wife and I have chosen a career where we're in the public light, but my kids have not,” Ashton told Arianna Huffington on The Thrive Global Podcast. “I think they should have the right to choose that and I actually don't think that they should have images of them as children that are out there, that somebody could potentially blackmail them with. It's their private life; it's not mine to give away.”  He did almost give it away at the beginning. Shortly after Wyatt's birth in 2014, he shared several photos of different babies, refusing to identify which one was his daughter.  ""Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy,"" he wrote in the post. ""Can you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute.""  Kutcher and Kunis aren't alone in their decision to shield their children from the public eye. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell are also known for keeping their kids off social media. And outside of the celebrity circuit, plenty of parents choose to keep their Facebook feeds child-free. And like Kutcher, they explain it's more about their child's autonomy than safety concerns.  PHOTO: Getty Images"	1
Presenter apologises for gags about disgraced producer after angry criticism from Rose McGowan and Asia Argento  James Corden has been forced to apologise for making jokes about Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual assault at a black-tie charity event in Los Angeles after being condemned by two of the women who have accused Weinstein of rape.  Actor Rose McGowan, who alleges that Weinstein raped her, tweeted a clip of Corden’s speech and wrote: “You motherfucking piglet.”  She said in an another tweet: “Hearing the audience’s vile roars [and] laughs show exactly what kind of Hollywood you really are.”  The Italian actor Asia Argento, who alleges that Weinstein raped her when she was 21, tweeted a video of Corden’s jokes. She added the caption: “Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him.”  Asia Argento (@AsiaArgento) Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him #amfARLosAngeles https://t.co/0SujRNCzd9  Corden has since apologised for causing offence, and says his jokes were intended to shame Weinstein, not his victims.  In a statement released on Twitter, the British star said: “To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey’s inexcusable behavior, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention.”    In footage of the event, loud groans can be heard after Corden told his audience it was a beautiful night in LA – “so beautiful, Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage”.  Corden said: “I don’t know whether that groan was that you liked that joke or you don’t like that joke. If you don’t like that joke you should probably leave now.”  Emboldened, he continued: “It has been weird this week hasn’t it, watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water. Ask any of the women who watched him take a bath … it’s weird watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water.  “Harvey Weinstein wanted to come tonight but he’ll settle for whatever potted plant is closest.”  That joke prompted more groans. “Oh come on!” said Corden.  McGowan also said that CBS, who broadcast Corden’s Late Late Show should donate to a women’s charity, or they too “support rape culture”.  Corden, the host of The Late Late Show, was master of ceremonies at the gala for amfAR, a foundation for Aids research, on Friday evening. The footage of his jokes was posted on Twitter by a Hollywood Reporter journalist, Chris Gardner.  Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) Straight out gate, host @JKCorden with Harvey Weinstein jokes. Too soon? Some laughs, some groans #amfARLosAngeles pic.twitter.com/nx88w5UwUe  Julia Roberts was given a special award for courage during the event while the guests included Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn, Melanie Griffith, Sean Penn and Coldplay’s Chris Martin as a surprise guest performer.  For many on Twitter, Corden’s jokes were far too soon. “James Corden’s ‘jokes’ about the Weinstein situation are disgusting. Sexual harassment is never funny. Ever,” wrote one user.  “James Corden just embarrassed every #Brit in #LA. Whack jokes about #Weinstein & #sexualassault are no joke,” wrote another.  Harvey Weinstein: Scotland Yard investigates further sexual assault claims Read more  Weinstein was executive producer of the 2013 film One Chance, a biopic in which Corden played the Britain’s Got Talent winner Paul Potts. It was Corden who suggested Take That’s Gary Barlow to Weinstein when he needed to change the music on his stage musical project Finding Neverland.  The condemnation of Corden for making jokes followed the condemnation of Saturday Night Live over a week ago for not making jokes and for ignoring the story altogether. But on Saturday Weinstein did feature. The show included a sketch featuring a “women’s roundtable” of actors at a film festival. On the subject of whisper networks, one said: “We had a secret code among us actresses to warn each other about creeps. The code was: ‘He raped me.’ And if the men were listening, they tuned us right out.”  In the regular “weekend update” section, the comedian Michael Che said: “It’s so easy to make jokes about a guy who looks like this,” pointing to a photo. “He looks like chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair.”  Weinstein said he has made a mistake, Che continued, but Weinstein’s actions were not a mistake. “You assaulted dozens of women. That’s not a mistake, that’s a full season of Law & Order.”	0

The awards returned in 2011 and are now held annually in May. The 2018 Billboard Music Awards aired live on NBC on May 20.  Award process [ edit ]  Unlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on album and digital songs sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement. These measurements are tracked year-round by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen Music and Next Big Sound. The 2018 awards are based on the reporting period of April 8, 2017 through March 31, 2018.[2] Awards are given for the top album, artist and single in a number of different music genres.

Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011.  On February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that it would bring the BMAs back to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011.[50] A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards.

"Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani and have no engagement and only hunt, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can handle this story exclusively. A representative confirms that the allegations are both wrong and fabricated.  Hollywood Life allegedly claims to have ""exclusive details"" about how Stefani and Shelton ""could renounce an engagement and make the covenant."" A so-called ""source close to Gwen"" is quoted as saying: ""They talk about it all the time and that's how they live together [sic] as if they were already married."" This alleged snitch goes on to say, ""With her busy deadline, Gwen even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just one Beach or somewhere in the country to loft, if the romantic mood is right. ""  Obviously, the site is unaware that a couple can be engaged and still run away, so these claims make no sense. In the sense of Dictionary.com ""elope"" means ""secretly run away to be married"". It does not exclude an engagement. It rather means marriage, which is held without knowledge or participation of other people. Of course, this is more than just terminology.  While the blog claims that the performers could ""skip"" an engagement, she has already spread several stories about her becoming engaged. If you look at just the last year, there are at least four stories that contradict this current narrative (see screengrabs of the headlines below). For example, in May 2017, the website claimed that Stefani wanted Shelton to suggest that she use her ""The Voice"" downtime to plan a wedding. By October, the store speculated that the country superstar had ""secretly suggested"" and they were engaged after Stefani was seen in a ""giant diamond ring"".  Then in December, there was an article by HollywoodLies, as he's called ""They'll never marry if they're not engaged in 2018"" and continue to say, ""If there's no ring on Gwen's finger by the end of the new year, the couple can take the marriage forever off the table. "" This latest piece, the ""source"" mentioned, calls the marriage between Shelton and Stefani ""inevitable."" That's not all. In February, the site claimed Shelton was shopping for a diamond ring, which was to be used in a ""Valentine's Day Proposal"".  Valentine's Day has clearly come and gone without any suggestion, so HollywoodLies is now pretending it has never made such an assertion or any of the others, so it may offer this new tale to ""skip"" an engagement. But journalism does not work in a vacuum. Consistency shows credibility. And the blog's own story shows that it's not believable. It is also noteworthy that HollywoodLies first alleged Shelton and Stefani broke through in 2015. A similar claim was made last November, and they still did. This also shows that the website is untrustworthy.  And that's not all. A few days ago, the outlet uncovered a false cover story Life & Style about Stefani, who is not just pregnant, but is also planning a wedding in Mexico that will feature celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. This new ""Exclusive"" does not mention pregnancy and does not explain what happened to the supposed plans for a star wedding. Regardless of whether the publication claims there will be a wedding or a secret ceremony, HollywoodLies is still wrong. Less than a month ago, it was reported that Stefani and Shelton are unwilling to marry and are so happy with their relationship.  So, both scenarios are wrong: They're not planning a big wedding or talking about Eloping. Stefani's representative already said Gossip Cop earlier this week that the wedding (and pregnancy) allegations were ""untrue"" and now the spokesman confirmed to us that this new story is fake and fake. On the basis of all the evidence sketched here by Gossip Cop that should be very clear."	1
Miranda Lambert is currently dating Evan Felker – a married man – and her ex Blake Shelton is apparently thrilled that everyone finally knows she is a homewrecker. Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn’t going to quietly put up with Shelton’s attacks anymore.  After the news of Lambert’s new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was – a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert’s embarrassment because for him this is personal.  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  “Blake is reveling in Miranda’s humiliation now that she’s been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,” claims the insider.  Even though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the “once a cheater always a cheater” theory.  The Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her “twisted relationship antics.”  The country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert “played the victim,” he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.  Now, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman’s husband, then it is “sweet justice.”  Miranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ — TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018  However, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a “hypocrite.”  Lambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn’t believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker’s marriage. So, she won’t be sitting around and taking Shelton’s jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.  Advertisement  Sources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn’t appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be “trading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.”	1
Sounds like he has legal trouble that is soaking up all his resources and he needs the movies to come out to stay afloat.    Kinda sad but at the same time he has to realize he hasn’t been essential since 2 Fast, since they brought him back he’s been nothing but comic relief, even in the wake of Paul’s passing. If he’s serious about this he’s really gonna lose his only source of income. It’s also making him look like a whiny bitch.    Dewayne is funny tho	0
"Amanda Rollins is a fictional character on the NBC police procedural drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, portrayed by Kelli Giddish. Rollins is a detective with the Manhattan Special Victims Unit at the 16th Precinct of the New York Police Department.  Background [ edit ]  Rollins transfers from the Atlanta PD to Manhattan SVU in June, 2011, after being assaulted by her deputy chief. Little is mentioned of her off-duty life (although, being from Atlanta, she is a fan of the Braves, whose schedule she keeps on her refrigerator door). She has a dog named Frannie that she dotes on.  Rollins grew up in Loganville,[1] and has a bachelor's degree in forensic science.[2] While working for the Atlanta PD, she was stationed at Precinct Zone 8.[3]  Character within SVU [ edit ]  The character is at first portrayed as wet behind the ears and overeager, and is frequently chastised by Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek) for getting ahead of herself.[4] Over time, however, she grows into the job.  She shares a good rapport with her partner, Detective Odafin Tutuola (Ice-T). Shortly after transferring to the 16th Precinct, Rollins investigates a series of rapes that she believes are being committed by a suspect in one of her cases in Georgia. Rollins tries to prove to Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) that the rapist originated in Atlanta and has come to New York for new prey. She nearly falls victim to him while trying to flush him out; the rapist has a preference for blonde, athletic women like her.[5]  When Rollins becomes distraught over a case in which an actress is raped by one of the men in her life, Rollins asks Benson how she can trust any man after working this job. Benson reassures Rollins and tells her that she trusted her former partner, Elliot Stabler (Chris Meloni).[6]  In the Season 14 episode ""Poisoned Motive"", Rollins is shot by a sniper in front of the precinct. Her shooting leads back to the daughter of Tutuola's former partner, who is seeking revenge on the NYPD after her father was injured on the job.[7]  Rollins' younger sister, Kim (Lindsay Pulsipher), is a cocaine addict with mental health issues. In the Season 14 episode ""Deadly Ambition"", Kim shows up at Rollins' door after leaving her abusive boyfriend, Jeff Parker (Theis Weckesser), who is also the father of her unborn child. One day, Rollins returns home to find Parker apparently raping Kim, and she shoots and kills him.  Eventually, however, she discovers that Kim staged the rape to manipulate Rollins into killing Parker, all so she could collect on his life insurance policy. Kim makes withdrawals from the policy in both their names, making it look as if Rollins masterminded the plan to kill Parker, and disappears. Rollins is arrested and charged with murder, but is exonerated with help from the SVU squad.[8]  In the Season 16 episode ""Forgiving Rollins"", it's revealed that while Rollins was working for the Atlanta PD, her sister got into trouble with the law, and Rollins was willing to sleep with her boss, Deputy Chief Charles Patton (Harry Hamlin), in order to get the charges dropped. When he started to get too rough with her, Rollins withdrew her consent, but Patton overpowered and raped her. She later helps another of Patton's victims, APD Detective Reese Taymor (Dreama Walker), get justice, resulting in Patton going into forced retirement and being put on the sex offender registry.[9]  It is implied in several episodes that Rollins is in a romantic, or at least sexual, relationship with Amaro. In one episode, a suspect asks if they are sleeping together; they do not answer his question and change the subject.[10] When Amaro beats up a suspect, Rollins blackmails the suspect's wife to get him to drop the charges.[11] In the episode ""Reasonable Doubt"", Amaro comes out of a shower in Rollins' apartment, and joins her on a sofa, clad only in a towel. It is confirmed in Season 17 that Amaro and Rollins were romantically involved when Rollins discovers she is pregnant and says Amaro is not the father, meaning they did at least sleep together.  The father of Rollins' child is later revealed to be Lt. Declan Murphy (Donal Logue), her former commanding officer. Murphy is deep undercover in Eastern Europe when he learns of the pregnancy, but he returns to New York to give her a direct line to him if she ever needs him. While Rollins is in labor, she suffers a placental abruption, almost resulting in her death, but she survives and gives birth to a baby girl she names Jesse. Carisi, who comes from a large family, sometimes assists Rollins with the baby.[12]  In ""Service"", it was revealed that she harbors a dislike for escorts, to the point of suggesting that an escort rape victim brought the assault on herself. The victim shows up at the station to complain that the investigation is hurting her business, and Rollins gives her $300 out of disgust; insulted, the victim throws the money in Rollins' face. Eventually, however, Rollins comes to see the victim as a human being, and is instrumental in bringing her rapist to justice. While having dinner with the victim to apologize for her behavior, Rollins admits that her prejudice against escorts stems from a former boyfriend cheating on her with one.  In ""The Book of Esther"", she uses deadly force during a hostage situation with a religious cult. Afterward, she finds out that she fired the shot that killed one of the cult members, a young woman she had tried to save from her abusive father, the patriarch of the cult. She is wracked with guilt, but finds some comfort in going to church.  In ""Man Up"", she reveals to Benson that she is pregnant with her second child. Also, she meets up with Dr. Al Pollack, her ex-boyfriend, for a lunch date and prepares to tell him about her pregnancy, but bolts out when she sees him flirting with a waitress and becomes unsure of balancing her second pregnancy with raising Jesse and with her work at SVU. In ""Zero Tolerance"", she considers getting back together with Pollack and tells him she is pregnant. When she is stunned by his reaction offering to pay for her abortion, after bonding with a girl who is separated from her mother and would like another sibling, she later decides to keep the baby, telling Pollack she does not need anything from him.  Gambling storyline [ edit ]  The Season 13 episode ""Home Invasions"" reveals not only that Rollins struggles with a gambling addiction, but that she had owed money to a suspect in the present murder investigation. When her gambling interferes with her job, Cragen offers to get her in a rehabilitation program. During a meeting, she reveals that her father also had a gambling problem.  In the Season 15 episode ""Rapist Anonymous"", Rollins is caught in the middle of a case when a woman from her program claims to have been raped by her sponsor. When the alleged rapist is killed, the woman is put on trial and Rollins testifies on her behalf, alienating her colleagues at SVU. When ADA Rafael Barba (Raúl Esparza) cross-examines her, he forces her to admit that she's been sleeping with her sponsor, Nate Davis (Thomas Sadoski), and reveals that Davis has had sexual relationships with several of his sponsees. This proves too much for her to handle, and her gambling addiction relapses.[13]  In the episode ""Gambler's Fallacy"", she's caught gambling in an illegal club and forced to work on the wrong side of the law by the criminals who run the club. One of the criminals is in fact an undercover police officer, Lt. Declan Murphy, who enlists Rollins to help him with a sting operation to arrest the club's owners. The sting is successful, and Murphy makes sure that Rollins keeps her detective's shield. Benson, however, says that she no longer trusts Rollins, and would transfer her if the precinct were not so short-staffed.[14]  Development [ edit ]  NBC announced on June 27, 2011, that Giddish would join the cast of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for its thirteenth season along with Cold Case's Danny Pino as Detective Nick Amaro, coinciding with Christopher Meloni's departure from the series.[15] Giddish told TV Guide during summer filming, ""Everybody on the set is really excited and energized. They've lost a family member with Chris Meloni leaving, but they've been very accepting of us. Amanda is thrilled to be here working with these people, and so am I.""[16]  In an interview with TV Guide prior to Giddish's debut episode as Rollins, ""Scorched Earth"", Giddish says about her character, ""My character is in complete awe of Olivia, Amanda's really eager to get in there because she knows her stuff and really eager to learn. She has come from Atlanta and there was a ceiling there, so she's come up to New York."" Giddish felt great about joining the series in its 13th season, ""I couldn't feel better about it. ... There's no intimidation, what attracted me was the prospect of re-invigorating a franchise that's been so well-known and so well-liked, and then to be the shaker and mover."" Giddish is confident that viewers will warm up to Rollins and Amaro with time. ""They're going to love us because it's not being forced in their faces,"" she says. ""The more you know about us and the more you see us in your living room, the more you're hopefully going to love us.""[17]  At the end of Season 13 of Law & Order: SVU, she and co-star Danny Pino weighed-in on their first season, and both Giddish and Pino say they received not only a ""very warm welcome"" from SVU's cast and crew, but saw their respective characters explored more than they could hope for in their first season. ""They’ve given me a lot to work with — and I hope they give me more next season,"" says Giddish. ""We're still playing 'musical chairs' in terms of partners, and that’s a great way to go about exploring the different characters."" Pino added, ""That’s what you hope for when you’re putting it down on paper and discussing what you want to play. I had [pre-season] conversations with [showrunner] Warren Leight, and you hope that starts materializing — and it did. And that bodes well going into Season 14.""[18]  Rather than have both newcomers paired together, Rollins is primarily partnered with Detective Odafin ""Fin"" Tutuola, a factor which contributed to the character's positive reception. Ice-T, who has portrayed Tutuola since the show's second season, praised both Giddish and Pino in the wake of Chris Meloni's departure, ""We had to regroup, like a football team,"" said Ice-T. ""The quarterback changed, but we still had to move the ball down the field. And we did well... Danny came in, strong. Kelli came in, strong. And we shut down the doubters.""[18]  Appearances and crossovers [ edit ]"	0

Serena Williams is two victories shy of breaking the record for most individual tennis grand slams all-time. She’s been the dominant force of her sport for two decades, and it seems no one will be able to stand the way of her quest in overtaking Margaret Court’s 24 grand slams.  Except maybe for a second baby.  In an interview with In Style magazine, the 36-year-old new mom says a second child would possibly send her into retirement. But she’ll have to discuss it with husband Alexis Ohanian first.  “I don’t know if I want to play if I have another baby, but you’re right. I need to talk to Alexis. We need a plan,” Williams said.  She also said, “If I weren’t working, I’d already be pregnant.”  Williams appears as the cover story for the magazine’s first-ever “Badass Women” issue. She talks about her first year of motherhood, how she and Reddit co-founder Ohanian hooked up, attending the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and, of course, all things badass.  Which women does Williams place in the badass category? They would be Beyonce, Rihanna and Kate Middleton.  And her own No. 1 badass moment involves her 10-month-old daughter, Olympia. Williams was nine weeks pregnant with Olympia in January 2017 when she won the Australian Open by ousting older sister Venus Williams in straight sets. It was Serena’s 23rd singles grand slam title.  “I had a really tough first round and an even tougher second round. I thought, ‘I’m probably going to lose early. That’s OK. I have a good excuse for the first time.'”  She consulted with a doctor about withdrawing from the tournament, but she was cleared to play with a warning to be careful on hot days.  “I was literally nine weeks by the end of the tournament. I was almost done with my first trimester,” she said. “Every day that passed I thought, ‘This is a dream.’ It was like an animated Disney movie. And by the time the quarterfinals came, I was like, ‘I know I can beat this girl,’ and at the semifinals I thought, ‘I know I can win this match.’ I didn’t think I would win the final, so when I won, it was like, ‘OK, this is crazy.'”  Get more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.  Sign up for our Coffee Break newsletter here.  Williams says tennis has been pushed to the background as she and Olympia have fallen into a daily routine.  “So I feed her, and then she snuggles with me, which is the best part of my day,” she said. “Then we play, and after that I sneak away to practice, usually around 8 a.m. The only rule I have at practice is to be done at 1 p.m., because as much as I love tennis, I need to be with her.”  Related Articles ‘Watch What Happens Live’ host Andy Cohen to become dad  Audrey Geisel, widow of Dr. Seuss, dead at 97  Barack Obama appears on Miranda’s latest ‘Hamilton’ song  Michelle Obama can wear whatever she wants now, and what she wants is sparkly thigh-high boots  Oprah Winfrey reminds Academy voters of ‘Black Panther’ and its Oscar-worthiness Williams also spoke about becoming fascinated by Silicon Valley because of Ohanian.  “I didn’t know his world at all, but I’ve always been tech-savvy,” she said. “I had a few investments before I met him, and I wanted to know more. So we started talking, just as friends. Just casually chatting. I was getting hot when he was talking about it all. So after that we just continued talking, and then, I don’t know — I love his world.”	0

Steven Bochco, a producer whose boundary-pushing series such as “Hill Street Blues” and “NYPD Blue” helped define the modern TV drama, has died. He was 74.  Bochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. A family spokesman told the Associated Press that he died in his sleep on Sunday after a battle with cancer, but did not release details of a memorial service.  Working with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV’s most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hourlongs featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.  The recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.  On “NYPD Blue,” he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger — who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. — drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.  Related 'NYPD Blue' Follow-Up Series Lands Pilot Production Commitment at ABC 'NYPD Blue' at 25: Dennis Franz, Amy Brenneman, Gordon Clapp Reflect on Legacy  Bochco launched such series as “Hill Street Blues” — a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show — and “L.A. Law” for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (“NYPD Blue,” “Doogie Howser, M.D.”) and notable failures, including the musical police drama “Cop Rock” and the serialized courtroom drama “Murder One,” which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title “Murder in the First,” for TNT, where it ran for three years.  Asked how he could risk gambling on a musical like “Cop Rock” given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, “With my deal, how could I not?”  Bochco wasn’t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of “NYPD Blue” led to the actor’s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former “L.A. Law” co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run for 11 years.  Although Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of “Hill Street” was born more out of necessity than design.  “We had so many characters that we realized we couldn’t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,” he told the New York Times.  The producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When “Cop Rock” came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.  Bochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against “NYPD Blue” – which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered – ultimately helped promote the series and turned it into a hit.  Steven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company’s onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.  He started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included “Columbo,” with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.  Bochco wrote such features as “The Movie Maker” and “Silent Running” before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including “Delvecchio,” a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came “Bay City Blues,” about a baseball team, which didn’t last.  With “Hill Street Blues,” Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like “Hill Street” and “Cheers” was rewarded after “The Cosby Show” premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.  Beyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on “Hill Street” and enlisting David E. Kelley — then a Boston lawyer — to work on “L.A. Law.”  When the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as “the standard all television producers strive for.”  For all of his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire “Capitol Critters” to “Public Morals,” an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.  Although major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of “Commander in Chief” — an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president — and co-creating “Over There,” an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.  Bochco also produced the legal drama “Raising the Bar” for TNT that ran two seasons in 2008 and 2009.  The producer also tried his hand at novels, writing “Death by Hollywood,” a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist. His struggle with leukemia prompted him to write his autobiography, “Truth is a Total Defense: My Fifty Years in Television,” which he self-published in 2016.  Bochco was loyal to his friends — certain actors appeared in his shows time and again — but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.  Bochco’s association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in “Hill Street Blues,” and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on “L.A.

His son, Jesse, became a prominent director, working on many of his father’s shows.  Bochco was thrice married, the first time to Gabrielle Levin, the second to Bosson.  He is survived by his third wife Dayna Kalins, whom he married in 2000, as well children Melissa Bochco, Jesse Bochco and Sean Flanagan, and two grandchildren.	0
"A Bad Moms Christmas is a 2017 American Christmas comedy film written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. It is a sequel to the 2016 film Bad Moms. The plot follows the three moms from the first film (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn) dealing with their own mothers (Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon) visiting during the Christmas holiday.  Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia in May 2017, and the film was released by STXfilms in the United States on November 1, 2017. It received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at the thin story and raunchy jokes, and grossed over $130 million worldwide.[3]  Plot [ edit ]  Amy (Mila Kunis) is now in a happy relationship with Jesse (Jay Hernandez) and is looking forward to having a simple Christmas. Her plans are derailed when her overly critical mother, Ruth (Christine Baranski), texts her to say she is coming for Christmas.  Meanwhile, Kiki (Kristen Bell) is still overworked with her four kids but now her husband Kent is much more helpful. Kiki is surprised when her mother Sandy (Cheryl Hines) shows up three days earlier than expected and is planning to spend the next three weeks with Kiki. Sandy's love for Kiki is overwhelming, and smothering Kiki.  When Carla (Kathryn Hahn) gets home, her mother, Isis (Susan Sarandon), has arrived, telling her she intends to spend time with her for the first time in years. Surprised by this turn of events Carla is excited to spend time with her. Eventually, Amy, Kiki and Carla go to the mall where they express their misery over the holidays. But while commiserating about the pressures of the holidays they make a pact to ""take Christmas back"". Ruth tries to create a spectacle out of Christmas, rather than keeping it simple like Amy wanted. In an effort to tamp down those plans Amy takes the family to Sky Zone to meet up with Kiki and Carla and their families. Ruth, Sandy and Isis all meet and chat while their daughters have fun with their kids.  At work, Carla meets an erotic dancer named Ty (Justin Hartley), who says he is competing in a Sexy Santa competition and he asks Carla to be his date, which she enthusiastically accepts. Kiki continues to have issues with her mother's overbearing ways and decides to bring Sandy to Dr. Karl (Wanda Sykes) to discuss these issues. This leads to a breakdown in communication leading to Kiki scolding Sandy and causing her to leave the session.  Amy and Kiki join Carla as they attend the Sexy Santa show. All the ladies in the room are impressed with Ty's dancing. To everyone's surprise, Isis gets up on the bar and starts dancing with Ty. Carla runs up to get Ty back, leading to a fight. When Carla brings Isis home, Isis tells her she needs money for a new investment, but Carla knows she's just going to gamble it all away and then disappear from Carla's life like it's been for years. Nonetheless, Carla relents and loans Isis the money.  On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki that she put up a cash offer for the house next door so that she can live right next to Kiki. Finally, Kiki lashes out and tells Sandy she cannot live next door and that she wants some space. Sandy leaves the room crying.  Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers Ruth has invited a bunch of strangers over to her home to throw an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy did not want. Amy loses her temper and demands everyone leave her home and tells Ruth to leave and get out of her life forever. Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a note from Isis indicating she has just taken off with the money she lent her. Kiki is all alone as well.  Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass and is, surprisingly, joined by Sandy and Isis. All the ladies criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, with each of them realizing their flaws. Amy's father, Hank, goes to her to talk about Ruth and the horrible fight they had, but acknowledging that while Ruth can be difficult to deal with, Ruth has always been incredibly insecure, always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but she always had the right intentions and loved Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church where Ruth is in order to try and repair her relationship with her mother. The two apologise to each other, with both confessing how much they genuinely love each other. Ruth tells Amy that she is a wonderful mother. The two embrace tightly. As the clock strikes midnight, Amy realises that she needs her mother to help her fix Christmas. The two rush home to start decorating the house properly.  On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan go downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looking wonderful with decorations and gifts. Kiki makes up with Sandy, who tells her she put the neighboring house on the market and admits that she's just always felt lonely on Christmas since Kiki's father died. Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone.  All the families get together and Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  In December 2016, it was announced that A Bad Moms Christmas would be released on November 3, 2017, and that it would be Christmas-themed, with Bell, Hahn, and Kunis returning to reprise their roles.[4][5] The release date was subsequently moved up two days to November 1, 2017.[6] In April 2017, Justin Hartley joined the cast of the film,[7] and in May 2017, Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines joined as the mothers' mothers, alongside Wanda Sykes and Jay Hernandez reprising their roles from the first film.[8]  Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia on May 1, 2017.[9][10]  Release [ edit ]  A Bad Moms Christmas was released on Wednesday, November 1, 2017. It was originally scheduled for November 3, 2017, but was pushed back two days to avoid direct competition with Thor: Ragnarok.[11]  In Australia, the film was released under the title Bad Moms 2.  Home media [ edit ]  The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on February 6, 2018 in the United States and Canada.  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  A Bad Moms Christmas grossed $72.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.6 million, against a production budget of $28 million.[2]  In North America, the film was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,615 theaters in its first five days (including $17 million over the weekend).[12] It took in $2.7 million on its first day,[13] and $17 million over the weekend, for a five-day total of $21.6 million, finishing second at the box office behind Thor: Ragnarok.[14]  Critical response [ edit ]  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on 116 reviews with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Featuring twice the moms but roughly half the laughs, A Bad Moms Christmas is a slapdash holiday sequel that falls short of the original with a disappointing dearth of good cheer.""[15] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[16] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale, down from the ""A"" earned by the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a ""very low"" 68% overall positive score.[13]  Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing, ""A Bad Moms Christmas should appeal to the same—dare I say it?—demo that Bad Moms did, even though it's not nearly as wild a comedy. It has one halfway original idea, which is that when you're a mom yourself, the ability of your own mom to drive you nuts is heightened to the third power, because you're competing on levels that are almost primal.""[17] Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it a ""good time movie"" and writing: ""...it goes way over the top, but I have to confess I laughed—a lot—and that's obviously the point even if this is not critic's fodder or meant to be. Subtle this is not, but A Bad Moms Christmas is the perfect tonic to lift your spirits and forget your troubles in these dark times.""[18]  Three New Zealanders, following in the footsteps of Kiwi heroes Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery (of ""The Worst Idea of All Time""), are watching this film every week for a year (52 times in total) for their podcast ""The Even Worse Idea of All Time""."	0
Beyoncé surprised ex-49ers player Colin Kaepernick Tuesday night, presenting him with the SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, which honors an athlete who uses their platform to further change.  Beyoncé took a strong stance on Kaepernick’s actions to protest police brutality at the 2017 Sportsperson of the Year Awards Show in New York. Kaepernick’s decision to remain seated while the national anthem played back in 2016 sparked similar protests by NFL players that continue to incite controversy in the present.  “Thank you Colin Kaepernick. Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction,” the “Lemonade” singer said in her presentation speech. “Thank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better. To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color.”  “We’re still waiting for the world to catch up. It’s been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America. So, let’s be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selfless serve and protect our country and our communities and our families. His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. Let’s not get that mistaken.”  Related Two Beyonce Albums Leak Onto Streaming Services — Then Disappear Beyonce Buys Out Ivy Park Co-Owner After Chairman Accused of Sexual and Racial Harassment  In his acceptance speech, Kaepernick said that his “platform is the people.”  “I say this as a person who receives credit for using my platform to protest systemic oppression, racialized injustice and the dire consequences of anti-blackness in America,” he said. “I accept this award not for myself, but on behalf of the people. Because if it were not for my love of the people, I would not have protested. And if it was not for the support from the people, I would not be on this stage today. With or without the NFL’s platform, I will continue to work for the people because my platform is the people.”  Kaepernick has been unable to find a new NFL position since he opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season, and sued the NFL and its owners in October for collusion against hiring him. Kaepernick also received the ACLU’s courageous advocate award Monday evening.  The 2017 SI Sportsperson of the Year Show will air on NBCSN and on Univision Deportes Network at 8 p.m. ET Dec. 8 and Dec. 9, respectively.	0
Oprah Winfrey takes part in a town hall meeting with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Marietta, Georgia, Nov. 1. (Chris Aluka Berry/Reuters)  Contributing opinion writer  A political mentor had a saying when he looked at a good political commercial: “There’s votes in that spot.” That phrase came back to me yesterday when I saw Oprah Winfrey say, “This land was made for you and me.” The phrase makes a powerful rallying cry for a lot of Democrats in 2018 and beyond, and the reigning queen of all media rolled out this line while stumping for Stacey Abrams in the race for governor in Georgia.  While Winfrey has denied interest in running for office herself, the rumor that she will lingers. The rumor itself isn’t all that interesting. But listening to her yesterday, I thought her candidacy for president would be fascinating.  The Democrats have a number of high-profile candidates who have been mentioned to take on the Republicans’ reality-show star in 2020, many of whom rose outside of politics. In addition to Winfrey, there is Howard Schultz of Starbucks, actor Tom Hanks, former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg and Disney’s Bob Iger.  Trump, of course, knows Winfrey well, having appeared on her show. And he’s had nice things to say about her in the past. He undoubtedly still envies her mastery of branding and media as she built an empire after starting as a local newscaster in Nashville. Lately, he hasn’t been as kind, calling her “insecure” and saying he would love to run against her because (cue innuendo) he knows her “weakness.”  But Trump presumably knows her strengths, too. She has spent a lifetime interviewing people and understands how to give meaning to the struggles and aspirations of a wide cross section of Americans. If Trump is our national storyteller for fear and loathing, Winfrey is ours for hope and striving. Trump screams about an America under siege and beset by internal and external enemies; Winfrey has spent a lifetime in conversation with us about how we are all redeemable and that we can all have our piece of the pie.  It may be unlikely, but a presidential race which pits the slogan, “Make America Great Again: The Sequel” against “This land was made for you and me” would get huge ratings and present our country with a very clear choice. Time will tell how the show plays out.  Read more:  Carter Eskew: Are there any thoroughbreds in the Democratic presidential field?  Carter Eskew: A better closing argument for Democrats	0
"Legendary character actor Harry Dean Stanton died on Friday, and Hollywood was quick to mourn the “Big Love” actor.  Jon Cryer, who starred alongside Stanton in 1986’s “Pretty in Pink,” posted a photo of the two on set with the caption, “Was an honor, man. #RIPHarryDeanStanton”  “Baby Driver” director Edgar Wright also shared a still of Stanton from “Repo Man” with the caption, “RIP to the legendary Harry Dean Stanton. Impossible to cover his legacy in brief but here’s a few favs: ‘Alien,’ ‘Paris Texas,’ ‘Repo Man.'”  RIP to the legendary Harry Dean Stanton. Impossible to cover his legacy in brief but here's a few favs: 'Alien', 'Paris Texas', 'Repo Man'. pic.twitter.com/tKglu0Bemv — edgarwright (@edgarwright) September 15, 2017  Longtime Stanton collaborator David Lynch, who most recently worked with him on the “Twin Peaks” revival, released a statement, writing, “The great Harry Dean Stanton has left us. There went a great one. There’s nobody like Harry Dean. Everyone loved him. And with good reason. He was a great actor (actually beyond great) – and a great human being – so great to be around him!!! You are really going to be missed Harry Dean!!! Loads of love to you wherever you are now!!!“  Director Monte Hellman made “Ride in the Whirlwind” (1966), “Two Lane Blacktop” (1971), and “Cockfighter” (1974) with Stanton. He told Variety that he met Stanton through Jack Nicholson “back when they were roommates.” Hellman said that Stanton “had the same quality as all great actors and I think Harry summed it up best himself when he told me some advice Jack had given him. It was ‘Let the wardrobe do the acting.’ He was one of a kind and he didn’t have a bad angle. You could him up, down, left, right and he always looked great. He did have an actor’s ego and did want to garner more lead roles. I remember on ‘Two Lane Blacktop’ he thought he should have been cast in the Warren Oates part. He was also very upset when he discovered, on location in Oklahoma, that the character was a gay hitchhiker. This was 1970 and he was a little bit old-fashioned in his thinking then. Actually, he was so pissed off, he almost quit. But then he delivered what I believe is one of the most moving performances of his life.”  Shawn Doyle, who acted with Stanton in “Big Love,” tweeted a tribute. “You could watch him on set say a line as simple as ‘hello,’ and be mystified why it was so friggin compelling.”  You could watch him on set say a line as simple as ""hello"", and be mystified by why it was so friggin compelling. #RIPHarryDeanStanton — Shawn Doyle (@Shawndoyle) September 15, 2017  Horror film director John Carpenter, who directed the actor in “Escape From New York,” tweeted, “Harry Dean Stanton was a wonderful man, kind and full of humor. He was also a great actor. Goodbye, Harry Dean. Rest in peace.”  Harry Dean Stanton was a wonderful man, kind and full of humor. He was also a great actor. Goodbye, Harry Dean.

"“You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” she says of her forthcoming weekly program.Michelle Wolf has landed a show of her own.After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf’s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda — unless, of course, it’s funny. “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix’s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: ""We're thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.""The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (""I want equal pay! And a chardonnay"") to dating and other social issues.Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central — and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network’s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.Looking ahead, Wolf's Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President’s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.Wolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman."	1

She returned home on December 30. “So excited for the future and seeing my family!! Six weeks of treatment and I feel good! Gotta work it when I get home thanks for all your support,” she tweeted on her way home.  Before entering treatment in November, Lowell exclusively spoke to Us Weekly about her journey to recovery.  “I’m taking the time I need right now to take good care of myself,” she said. “On November 17th I thought of every way possible to commit suicide … from wrapping a belt around my neck to just running my car into an electric pole. Thank God I have a support system and a HUSBAND and a DAUGHTER. Thank God I am self aware I’m seeking treatment and I WILL get better. Anyone feeling alone you ARE NOT ALONE! This world needs all of us!

We’ve all seen those keyboard warriors who troll accounts on social media looking for a place to spew their negativity and venom, casting judgment on those who have a different opinion or that they think they are superior to. And as quickly as the target of their hate fires back, they vanish, deleting their comments as others smack them down in defense of the person they initially criticized.  The typical victims of these cowards are those who are living their best life. Celebrities, entertainers, high profile athletes and, of course, their spouses are easy targets because of their social media presence. But we’ve seen it before. Kelly Clarkson has been a victim, as have Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani. Even Carrie Underwood and sweet Lauren Akins, wife of Thomas Rhett, have been the bullseye of these haters’ arrows. It’s ridiculous.  RELATED: The sexiest man alive, Blake Shelton, gets a chuckle out of his haters’ tweets  From time to time, sassy stars like Kelly, or super sweet and supportive spouses like Lauren, fire back. And while their methods may be different, the result is the same—they aren’t having it.  Now Jason Aldean’s wife, Brittany, has had enough, too.  Jason and Brittany are taking an adults only vacation with their great friends Dee Jay Silver and his wife, gorgeous Jenna Perdue. The couples are enjoying some much-needed grownup beach time without their respective little ones, Memphis and Wake.  Both Brittany and Jenna have shared photos of their tropical locale and some of the great outfits and swimsuits they are both wearing, and, apparently, the haters were commenting on Jason’s lack of boots. One commented that he looked like he was in a boy band, and another asked if he was only country when he was in concert. Still another said, “Talk about a woman who totally changed a guy. Pathetic. She’s the one who wants him to wear skinny jeans and vneck shirts. He’s never dressed like that his entire life.”  Hmm … his “entire life?” Must be a lifelong friend of Jason’s.  Of course, like shamers and keyboard critics are inclined to do, many deleted their comments after Jason and Brittany’s loyal following began calling them out, but the beautiful blonde eventually had enough and put her foot down.  RELATED: A precious pic from Brittany Aldean shows Daddy Jason getting some sweet snuggles  Sharing a photo of herself with her handsome hubs, Brittany wrote, “Much needed vacay☀ Just a word of wisdom for all the parent shamers … vacations are OM for new parents to take. Sometimes after being pregnant for almost a year, cooped up in a house for weeks at a time, you need a little sunshine and adult time. It is not OK to leave your ignorant comments. If you don’t agree with something, please … do me a favor and unfollow me. You will NOT be missed♥ And for all the sweet, positive, happy people … we love you and thank you!!💋💋”  What? What? “Unfollow me?” But Brittany, what would these haters do with their anger then? Girl, we got you.  Obviously, we’re being sarcastic and we applaud the heck out of Brittany for speaking out against this unnecessary form of bravado. We’d also like to add, DANG SISTER! You look AMAZING for just having had a baby! Good on ya!  Haters, lighten up. We’re sure Jesus appreciates ya, but he can handle the judging on his own.	0
"The torch track is “about a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,” he says.  The drought is broken: Sam Smith is back with his first new music in two years. The British soulman returns with “Too Good At Goodbyes,” his first release since 2015’s “Writing’s On The Wall” from Spectre, which became the first James Bond theme to hit No. 1 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart.  Written with longstanding collaborator Jimmy Napes and Stargate, ""Too Good At Goodbyes"" builds into a gospel chorus and showcases Smith's exceptional range. The torch track is “about a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,” says Smith. “It's been a long while since I've put any music out and I feel that this first single sets the tone of what is to come.”  On it, Smith sings ""Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry / And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry / And every time you walk out, the less I love you / Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true,"" hitting high notes which suggest he's put behind him the vocal cord injury which plagued him in 2015.  Smith is coming off a spectacular start to his recording career. His debut album In The Lonely Hour was a smash, hitting No. 1 in the U.K. and shifting more than 12 million units worldwide. He’s gone on to collect an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, three Brit Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and four Grammys.  In support of his new release, Smith will play four dates later this month at venues yet to be confirmed. He’ll start Sept. 11 in Los Angeles, then head east with stops in New York (Sept. 13), London (Sept. 15) and, finally, Berlin (Sept. 18).  Listen to “Too Good At Goodbyes” below.

"This article is about the American actor. For other people named Tom Cruise, see Tom Cruise (disambiguation)  Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. He started his career at age 19 in the film Endless Love (1981), before making his breakthrough in the comedy Risky Business (1983) and receiving widespread attention for starring in the action drama Top Gun (1986) as Lieutenant Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. After starring in The Color of Money (1986) and Cocktail (1988), Cruise starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning drama Rain Man. For his role as anti-war activist Ron Kovic in the drama Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Cruise received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.  In the 1990s, Cruise starred with Jack Nicholson in the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992) and starred in a number of box office hits including The Firm (1993) and Interview with the Vampire (1994), before starring as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in the action spy thriller Mission: Impossible (1996), the first of a commercially successful six-film series. In 1996, Cruise also starred as the title character in the romantic comedy-drama Jerry Maguire, earning him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second Academy Award nomination. In 1999, Cruise starred in the erotic thriller Eyes Wide Shut opposite his then wife Nicole Kidman and also appeared in the ensemble drama Magnolia, for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  After receiving a Saturn Award for Best Actor for his performance in the psychological thriller Vanilla Sky (2001), Cruise collaborated with director Steven Spielberg on the science fiction thrillers Minority Report (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005). In 2008, he gave a supporting performance in the action comedy Tropic Thunder and starred in the historical thriller Valkyrie as Claus von Stauffenberg. In 2012, Cruise played the eponymous role in the thriller Jack Reacher. Cruise's films have grossed more than $3.7 billion at U.S. and Canadian box offices and more than $9.0 billion worldwide,[1] making him the eighth highest-grossing actor in North America and one of the top-grossing actors worldwide.[2]  Cruise has been married three times, to actresses Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, Katie Holmes, and has three children, two of which were adopted during his marriage to Kidman and has one biological daughter with Holmes, whom he divorced from in 2012. Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, and credits it with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, his Church-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, particularly for 9/11 rescue workers, and his efforts to promote Scientology as a religion in Europe sparked controversies, as did a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.  Early life  Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III,[3] an electrical engineer, both originally from Louisville, Kentucky.[4][5] He has three sisters: Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. They are of English, German, and Irish ancestry.[6][7] One of Cruise's paternal great-great-great-grandfathers, Patrick Russell Cruise, was born in north County Dublin in 1799; he married Teresa Johnson in County Meath, in 1825. They left Ireland for the United States that same year and settled in New York.[6] They had a daughter, Mary Paulina Russell Cruise, whose son Thomas Cruise Mapother was Cruise's great-grandfather.[8][9][10][11] A cousin, William Mapother, is also an actor; he and Cruise have appeared in five films together.[12]  Cruise grew up in near poverty, and had a Catholic upbringing. The family was dominated by his abusive father, whom Cruise has described as ""a merchant of chaos.""[13] Cruise has said that he was beaten by his father, whom he has called a ""bully and coward."" He stated, ""He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'""[13]  Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. His family moved to Beacon Hill, Ottawa, in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces.[14] There, Cruise attended the newly opened Robert Hopkins Public School for much of grade four and grade five.[14][15] In grade four, Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.[14] Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, ""The movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece.""[14] Cruise also enjoyed sports at the school and played floor hockey, though he was known more for his aggression than his talent.[citation needed]  In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa, Canada. However, in the spring of that year, Cruise's mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.[14] His father died of cancer in 1984.[16] Cruise briefly attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest, before his interest in acting.[17]:24–26 In his senior year, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but he was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.[17]:47 In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years, including stints in at least two suburban New Jersey towns, including Glen Ridge.[18]  Career  Acting  Cruise first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as ""A Generation X classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise"",[19] and which, along with 1986's Top Gun, cemented his status as a superstar.[20] Cruise also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985.[21]  Cruise followed up Top Gun with The Color of Money, which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. 1988 saw him star in Cocktail, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989's Born on the Fourth of July, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.  Cruise's next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.[22]  In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.[23]  In 1996, he took on the title role in Jerry Maguire, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut, and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Magnolia, for which he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.  Cruise in March 2006  In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style, and continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures. Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for this film.  His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.[24][25] The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction thriller Minority Report which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.  In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick's historical drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star, and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.[24]  Edge of Tomorrow, May 2014. Cruise in Paris at the French premiere of, May 2014.  In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office.[26] In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as ""Les Grossman"" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.[27]  In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010.[28] On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011[29] to high critical acclaim[30] and box office success.[31] Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is Cruise's biggest commercial success to date.[32]  On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist.[33] In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages, in which he played the character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012.[34]  Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012.[35] It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $216,568,266 worldwide.[36][37] In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $285,600,588 worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko.[38][39]  As of mid-2015 Cruise's films have grossed about $8.2 billion worldwide.[40]  Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced.[41] Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director.  Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff's 1932 horror movie The Mummy.[42] The new film, also titled The Mummy, was produced by Alex Kurtzman, Chris Morgan, and Sean Daniel, written by Jon Spaihts and directed by Kurtzman. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout.  Producing  Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,[43] and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.  Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as ""one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood."" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.[44]  Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson's New York Times bestseller, The Devil in the White City about a real life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World's Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.[45]  Cruise has produced for multiple films in which he has been. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.[46]  Break with Paramount  On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount's parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.[47][48] Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.[49]  Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.[50][51]  Management of United Artists  In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.[43] Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive.  Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,[52] opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.  In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.[53]  Relationships  Cruise has been divorced three times and has three children (two adopted and one biological).  In the early to mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with older women, including Rebecca De Mornay,[54] three years his senior; Patti Scialfa,[55] nine years his senior; and Cher,[56] sixteen years his senior.[57]  Marriage to Mimi Rogers  Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987.[58] They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers introduced Cruise to the Church of Scientology.[59]  Marriage to Nicole Kidman  Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella and Connor Antony. In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, ""It was wrongly reported,"" and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.[60] Before Kidman's next marriage to Keith Urban, she spoke of how much she still loved Cruise, saying in 2006: ""He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him.""[61]  Dating Penelope Cruz and Nazanin Boniadi  Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). The relationship ended in 2004.[62] An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair states that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, the Church of Scientology launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of ""auditions"" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology.[63]  The Church of Scientology and Cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of ""shoddy journalism"" and ""religious bigotry.""[64] Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.[65][66]  Marriage to Katie Holmes  In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes – dubbed ""TomKat"" by the media – made their first public appearance together in Rome.[67] A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show, famously jumping up and down on Winfrey's couch during the show.[68] On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child.[69] In April 2006 their daughter Suri was born.  On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, in a Scientology ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars.[70][71] The actors' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[72] There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology.[73][74] David Miscavige, the head of the Church of Scientology, served as Cruise's best man.[75]  On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise after five and a half years of marriage.[76][77] On July 9, 2012, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers.[78] Because New York law requires that all divorce documents remain sealed, the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.[79]  Scientology  Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers at the 1989 Oscars  Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers.[80] Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age[81] and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.[82]  Cruise's advocacy of Scientology  In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin, described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.[83][84]  Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession[85] and from firefighters.[86]  For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.[87]  Criticism of psychiatry  In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement ""I think psychiatry should be outlawed.""[88] Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which Shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. Shields responded that Cruise ""should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.""[89] This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005.[90]  Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.[91][92] Shields herself called Cruise's comments ""a disservice to mothers everywhere.""[93] In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.[94]  Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.[87] It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.[95] Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.[96]  YouTube video removal  On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.[97][98] The Church of Scientology said the video had been ""pirated and edited"", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.[98][99] YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.[100]  After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of November 2017, the video has achieved over 12 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.[101]  Scientology's purported influence on Cruise's relationships  In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.[102]  In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.[103] DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.[104] Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.[105][106]  The 2015 documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor.[107] In the film, Cruise's former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion (which Cruise's lawyer denies).[108][109]  Legacy  Cruise and Katie Holmes interacting with fans in March 2006  In 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor,[110] as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor.[111] The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity.[112] The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the ""two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.""[113]  In August 2006, Paramount cited Cruise's ""recent conduct"" as the reason they did not renew their production contract with him.[114] In addition, Marketing Evaluations reported that Cruise's Q score (a measure of the popularity of celebrities), had fallen 40 percent.[115][116]  October 10, 2006, was declared ""Tom Cruise Day"" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because he has made more trips to Japan than any other Hollywood star.[117]  ""Tom Cruise Picture""  While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Some of Cruise's later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.  Widescreenings noted that for Tom Cruise's character Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men, ""[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do."" Sorkin and director Rob Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee's potential in the film.[118]  Litigation  During Cruise's marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.[119]  In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,[120] and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.[121]  Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis, who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.[122]  In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.[123]  In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dropped due to statute of limitations.[124][125]  In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style for defamation after the magazines claimed Cruise had ""abandoned"" his six-year-old daughter.[126] During deposition, Cruise acknowledged that 110 days had passed without him seeing her. The suit was ultimately dropped.[127]  Selected filmography  Awards and nominations  See also"	1

After transgender New York nightlife fixture Amanda Lepore dished in her new memoir, “Doll Parts,” about a relationship with an unnamed rapper, sources have speculated the hip-hop maven in question could be Kanye West.  A New York Times profile this week on voluptuous Lepore says that in the book, “Ms. Lepore describes having an assignation with a famous rapper whose songs often play in the clubs she frequents. Soon after, she writes, he got married, and ‘I couldn’t help but think that his wife had a similar body type to me.’ ”  That sparked buzz that the unnamed rapper was West — now married to curvy reality queen Kim Kardashian.  But rap fans may have to keep guessing.  A pal of Kanye’s shot down any such rumors by telling us: “That is not within the realm of possibility.” Lepore did not get back to us to confirm or deny the identity of the rapper of her alleged “assignation.”  An attorney for West responded that the rapper has never met Lepore, and has never even heard of her.  Meanwhile, West is also being talked about in the Hamptons this week. A year ago, it was announced that he’d perform a special piece at the arty Watermill Center Summer Benefit & Auction with its influential artistic director Robert Wilson — but it was pulled last minute, and Ja Rule filled in.  At the time, a source explained to us that West couldn’t attend because “it was all too last-minute.”  And reps for the event added, “Robert Wilson and Kanye West have made an artistic decision to postpone their collaboration” until 2017.  But an updated tip sheet for this year’s benefit, which takes place July 29, went out Thursday with no mention of West. The benefit this year will honor French star Isabelle Huppert and late rocker Lou Reed, with a performance of a “poem with musical accompaniment” by Reed’s widow, Laurie Anderson.  A Watermill rep explained of West’s absence: “With the decision to make this year’s benefit a tribute to Lou Reed, it was natural curatorial progression to highlight a special performance by our honoree Laurie Anderson.”  West has kept a low profile since his breakdown last year.	1
"In the 15 months since his marriage to Angelina Jolie ended, a lot has changed for Brad Pitt.  Pitt got sober after decades of substance abuse; he re-foucused his energies on being the best father he could be; and he worked with Jolie to hammer out a mutually amicable co-parenting relationship.  But according to the folks at Life & Style, not all of the changes in Pitt's life were quite so beneficial.  The tabloid claims that the emotional toll taken by the divorce left its marks on Pitt's famous face--and the 54-year-old responded by taking corrective action.  A plastic surgeon--who, of course, has not actually treated Brad--examined some ""before and after"" photos, and--surprise, surprise--his professional opinion is that Pitt has totes gone under the knife.  ""His forehead looks smoother, so most likely he got Botox,"" says Dr. Steve Fallek, a Jersey-based surgeon.  ""He also looks to have had some filler in the cheeks and around the mouth to improve those lines, a laser or peel to improve skin texture, and maybe some filler in the lower eye area.""  Not surprisingly, the folks at L&S were also able to dig up an anonymous source willing to ""confirm"" that Brad got his face overhauled.  ""He went to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon this year and got fillers and Botox and some eye work,"" an ""insider"" tells the tabloid.  The source claims life after Angie was even more stressful than Pitt anticipated, and the actor didn't want the world to know he'd been struggling:  ""Brad thinks the divorce has taken a toll on his looks,"" the insider says.  ""He's at an age where he can't get away with not sleeping or eating the way he could when he was younger. He doesn't want to do anything drastic. Brad just wants to make sure he looks his absolute best for this next movie role.""  In case it isn't clear, we're not quite buying this report.  Giving Brad a facelift would be like power-washing the Mona Lisa.  Any surgeon who would agree to do it should immediately have his license revoked.  Besides, what would Pitt's motivation be?  He's still working as much as ever, and something tells us he's not having a hard time in the female department.  The man's not exactly your typical divorced, 54-year-old father of six."	1

ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1
"Kim Kardashian broke the Internet. Beyoncé shut it down. But Will Smith brought it back to life the day he joined Instagram.  While the social media platform launched back in 2018, it wasn't until one fateful day in December 2017 that the Fresh Prince decided to post his first IG picture. It's been on ever since.  The charismatic super star let fans into his childhood when he shared a baby photo that required no filters. Approximately seven IG posts later, he had everyone hooked, especially when he showed just how proud he is to be a father by uploading a split image of Jaden and himself in similar poses at two different events.  Will then reminded his fans and binge watchers everywhere to keep watching Netflix (before the whole Mo’Nique boycott went down).  But it isn't just his wit and family pics that has everyone following Smith—it's his life advice. From inspirational posts laced with comedic timing, to his musings on what it takes to make a marriage last, Smith's insight never comes off as preachy, which people obviously relate to. Since joining in December, his followers have swelled to 8.9 million.  Bottom line? There are many reasons to love Will Smith's Instagram— nine major keys to be exact.  He's Motivational  No matter the subject, Will always finds new ways of encouraging people to cut the dead weight out of their lives, so that they can shine brighter.  He Inspires New Perspectives  Smith's response to this young artist's animation proves he’s not afraid to look at himself through someone else’s eyes.  His Co-Signs Are Everything  He waited approximately 2,700 days to launch his IG account but he used Ellen Degeneres' talk show as the plug when he did. Enough said.  He Defines Cultural Ideas  The now 49-year-old actor started off as a big-eared kid from Philly looking to make it. Somewhere along the way he transformed into an inebriated super hero, but not before experiencing life as one of the world's soul survivors. Now he's a full blown family man who's still doing backflips on a big screen while banking millions. He personifies the phrase, ""Black don't crack!""  He Always Remembers His Roots  Smith may be worth around $260 million, but he never forgets where he came from.  He Has the Best Friends  Understandably, Will Smith has a lot of high-ranking friends in a lot of high-ranking places. But sometimes, it’s not about the money or the fame. Sometimes it’s just having a lot of (high-ranking) celebrity friends who care just as much about the culture as you do.  He Shows His Family A Lot Of Love  Through all his stardom, Will has always seems to put family first. With his family by his side, he shows the new generation it’s still cool to be a family man.  He's All About Self-Empowerment  He announced he was starting a vlog to show people the things they can do when they’re not sleeping— and what he’s doing when we are.  He's A Genius  Will showed us he can rap and act, but when he jumped on camera and conquered a Rubik’s Cube, we realized he can do anything – even master the philosophies of a colorful square puzzle."	0
"Jennifer Anne Garner (born April 17, 1972)[1] is an American actress. Following a supporting role in Pearl Harbor (2001), Garner gained recognition for her performance as CIA officer Sydney Bristow in the ABC spy-action thriller Alias, which aired from 2001 to 2006. For her work on the series, she won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, and received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations.  While working on Alias, Garner garnered a cameo role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), followed by a praised leading performance in the romantic comedy film 13 Going on 30 (2004). Garner has appeared in supporting as well as lead film roles, including the superhero films Daredevil (2003) and Elektra (2005), the comedy-drama Juno (2007), and the fantasy-comedy The Invention of Lying (2009). In the 2010s, she appeared in the romantic-comedy Valentine's Day (2010), the fantasy comedy-drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012), the biographic drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), the comedy film Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (2014), the drama film Miracles from Heaven (2016), and the romantic comedy-drama film Love, Simon (2018).  Garner works frequently as an activist for early childhood education and is a board member of Save the Children. She is also an advocate for anti-paparazzi campaigns among children of celebrities. Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley from 1998 to 2003, during which they married. Garner married actor Ben Affleck in 2005; they separated in 2015 and divorced in 2018. Garner and Affleck have three children together.  Early life [ edit ]  Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972, in Houston, Texas, but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three. She is the second of three daughters.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide, and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was ""very conservative"" and her mother ""quietly blue.""[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, she and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's ""take on the world"" was ""practically Amish.""[12]  Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get ""straight As"" and instead wanted to perform ""in any kind of production.""[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994 she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]  Acting career [ edit ]  1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias [ edit ]  As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996 she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]  After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to ""provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight""[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]  Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: ""I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that.""[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: ""You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross.""[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought ""an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness"" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.  2002–2011: Transition to film [ edit ]  While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an ""other-worldly"" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure ""she would be the next superstar"".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered ""an aptitude for"" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she ""realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material.""[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.  Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year-old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her ""startling"": ""Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else.""[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an ""utterly beguiling"" performance: ""You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star.""[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: ""Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for.""[57] 13 Going on 30 grossed US$96 million worldwide.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner ""is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability ""to blend charm and gravity""[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her ""natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role.""[63]  After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: ""She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card.""[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never ""been lovelier or more affecting.""[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008 Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as ""captivating"": "" Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess's peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she's a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable.""[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her ""feistiness"" and "" lightness of comic touch"".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]  The Invention of Lying in 2009 Garner at a press conference forin 2009  Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, portraying the childhood friend of a famous photographer and womanizer (McConaughey). While the film received lukewarm reviews, it grossed US$102.2 million worldwide.[72] Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner ""easy to like and sharp with her timing"", he was disappointed to see her as ""the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character.""[73] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as ""less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words ""enter generic female lead"" in [the] screenplay).""[74]  Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner – ""always happy and always pleasant to everyone"" – against type.[75] In the film, she played the love interest of the first human with the ability to lie (Gervais) in a world where people can only tell the truth. Reviews for the movie were mixed and it made US$32.4 million worldwide.[76] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she ""proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on.""[77] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she ""has never been better onscreen [...] Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before.""[78]  In Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), she shared scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[79] The film made US$56.2 million in its U.S. opening weekend,; it eventually grossed US$110.4 million domestically and US$216.4 million worldwide.[80] In 2011, she had a supporting role as a villainous arranged bride in the comedy Arthur, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name, directed by Steve Gordon and co-starring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren.[81][82]  Butter in 2011 Garner at the premiere ofin 2011  Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton, in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green, which followed a magical pre-adolescent boy whose personality and naïveté have profound effects on the people in his town.[83] The film received mixed reviews from critics and made a modest US$56 million worldwide.[84][85] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her ""convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom""[86] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought ""fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity"" to the role.[87] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, in which she played an overly competitive and socially ambitious woman participating in a local butter sculpturing competition in a small Iowa town. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States only, Butter received mixed reviews and grossed US$105,018.[88][89] Peter Debruge of Variety praised ""the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner's comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30""[90] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the ""best in show"" : ""[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd.""[91] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: ""Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one.""[92] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena,[93] and became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[94]  Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 drama Dallas Buyers Club, portraying the role of a doctor treating AIDS patients in Texas during the mid-1980s.[95][96] The film received significant acclaim and was a box office success.[97] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as ""a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity""[98] and Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: ""Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here.""[99] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: ""It's not a well-shaped role, but I've gotten to the point where I'm happy to see Garner in anything. She's incapable of phoniness.""[100] Also in 2013, Garner became the first celebrity spokesperson of the Italian fashion brand Max Mara.[101]  In 2014, Garner starred opposite Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day, as the fictional salary cap analyst of Cleveland Browns. Critical reception towards the film was mixed and Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle describing her part, remarked: ""It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice.""[102] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, taking on the role of the mother of the titular character. The film grossed US$101 million worldwide.[103] Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: ""Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled.""[104] Her other film role in 2014 was that of an overprotective mother in the dramedy Men, Women & Children, directed by Jason Reitman and co-starring Rosemarie DeWitt, Judy Greer, Dean Norris, and Adam Sandler. The film made a US$2.2 million worldwide,[105] and Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: ""Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it's not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption.""[106] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[107]  In 2015's Danny Collins, a drama inspired by the true story of folk singer Steve Tilston and starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner played the supporting role of the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. The film was released in selected cinemas and was warmly received by critics; Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she ""gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion.""[108] In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven, playing the mother of a young girl who had a near-death experience and was later cured of an incurable disease. The film grossed US$73.9 million worldwide[109] and received generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt it ""makes the most out of an outstanding performance"" from Garner.[110] Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a ""dedicated"" and ""heartfelt"" performance[111] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found ""her subtly wrought work [...] tremendously effective"" in an otherwise ""crassly manipulative"" film.[112] Also in 2016, she starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the critically panned comedy Nine Lives, playing the second wife of a workaholic father who has his mind trapped inside of his daughter's new cat. Garner made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day (2016).

""There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids.""[138] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[139] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[140]  Personal life [ edit ]  Relationships and family [ edit ]  Garner met co-star Scott Foley on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000.

It was an eyebrow-raising moment she did not try to conceal.  And it has emerged supposed non-smoker Khloe Kardashian was holding a marijuana joint in a recent episode of her clan's television show portraying their holiday in Costa Rica.  In a typically exciting installment of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday, she was shown holding a suspicious-looking cigarette in her hand as she enthusiastically embraced her sister Kourtney's former lover Scott Disick.  No smoke without fire: Khloe Kardashian is said to have been holding a marijuana joint on Sunday's Keeping Up With The Kardashians  According to TMZ, sources close to production said they did not mind the fact the 32-year-old was holding a drug in the scene because it was a natural moment.  In addition, while marijuana is illegal in the United States, it is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica.  However it is hardly the first time the star has caused a stir due to smokling.  For back in 2014 she was photographed puffing away on a suspicious looking cigarette while in a nightclub with her then lover The Game.  However her spokesman claimed at the time: 'She doesn’t smoke pot or cigarettes. It's a Hookah stick, which is tobacco free. It’s called Phantom Smoke.'  Watch the joint: Khloe seemed careful as she went in for a hug with Scott Disick  Carried away: But she seemed to be relishing her clinch with sister Kourtney's former lover  No wonder it's so popular: Marijuana is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica  She was spotted smoking while on the dance floor while getting very close to rapper and self-proclaimed 'weed enthusiast,' whose real name is the rather less flamboyant Jayceon Taylor.  At one point in her exciting evening the classy broad was even seen waving her gargantuan behind at him, Miley Cyrus style.  The 37-year-old rapper recently raised by confirming he had slept with sisters Kim and Khloe, as well as their future sister-in-law Blac Chyna.  Chivalrous Jayceon told Wendy WIlliams after she quizzed him on his single Sauce, where he raps, 'I used to f*** b****s that Usher Raymond passed on, Then I f***ed three Kardashians.'  Sly puff? Perhaps the pair shared the suspicious-looking cigarette later	1
A day after Fox cancelled Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the praised cop comedy series has been picked up by NBC for a 13-episode sixth season.  NBC, whose sister studio Universal TV produces the Andy Samberg-starring series, was one of the potential suitors for the comedy after its cancellation. NBC also was among the broadcast networks that bid for the Brooklyn Nine-Nine pitch from creators Mike Schur and Dan Goor when it hit the marketplace in 2012 before the project landed at Fox in a very competitive situation.  “Ever since we sold this show to Fox I’ve regretted letting it get away, and it’s high time it came back to its rightful home,” said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman, NBC Entertainment. “Mike Schur, Dan Goor, and Andy Samberg grew up on NBC and we’re all thrilled that one of the smartest, funniest, and best cast comedies in a long time will take its place in our comedy line-up. I speak for everyone at NBC, here’s to the Nine-Nine!”  NBC  NBC’s pickup of Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows 32 hours of groundswell of support for the show on social media the magnitude of which we have rarely seen, with regular fans — joined by celebrity ones like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Guillermo del Toro, Seth Meyers and Mark Hamill — rallying behind it. Acknowledging the big role fans’ social media campaign played in the show’s resurrection, Brooklyn Nine-Nine‘s creators and stars announced the NBC pickup directly to them on Twitter. (you can see some of their posts below).  Created by the Parks and Recreation duo of Dan Goor and Michael Schur, who are former college roommates, Brooklyn Nine-Nine centers on Peralta, played by Saturday Night Live alum Samberg, a screwball who happens to be a real good cop. His captain in the NYPD’s 99th Precinct is Raymond Holt, a seen-it-all and emotion-challenged captain played by Andre Braugher, who scored three consecutive Emmy noms for Supporting Actor from 2014-2016. Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Joe Lo Truglio, Stephanie Beatriz, Chelsea Peretti, Joel McKinnon Miller and Dirk Blocker also star.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which was Fox’s highest-rated live-action comedy series this season among adults 18-49, is produced by Universal Television, Fremulon, Dr. Goor Productions and 3 Arts. Goor and Schur executive produce alongside David Miner and Luke Del Tredici. The show won two Golden Globes in its freshman season — for best comedy series and best actor in a comedy series (Samberg).  NBC is not the first broadcast network that has come to the rescue of a series produced by its sister studio. In a similar way, ABC and CBS picked up ABC Studios-produced Scrubs and CBS Studios-produced Medium, respectively, after their cancellations by NBC. Like them, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has off-network/SVOD deals that make prolonging their run good business for the parent company. For Fox, which didn’t own Brooklyn Nine-Nine, it was expensive, with a license fee said to be around $1.9 an episode.  NBC’s pickup of Brooklyn Nine-Nine brings the number of Schur series on the network to three — he also has The Good Place, which was renewed for a third season and the newly picked up comedy Abby’s.  Hey everyone, just wanted to say no big deal but….  NBC JUST PICKED #BROOKLYN99 UP FOR SEASON 6!!!  Thanks in no small part to you, the best fans in the history of the world! Nine-nine!!!!!!!!! — Dan Goor (@djgoor) May 12, 2018  So happy to announce:  NBC IS PICKING UP BROOKLYN 99 for SEASON 6!!! — The Lonely Island (@thelonelyisland) May 12, 2018  SQUAD YOU DID IT #BROOKLYN99 WILL BE ON NBC FOR OUR 6th SEASON! — Stephanie Beatriz (@iamstephbeatz) May 12, 2018	0
"Cheryl Ann Tweedy[1] (born 30 June 1983) is an English singer, songwriter and television personality. Born and raised in Newcastle upon Tyne, she rose to fame in late 2002 upon winning a place in Girls Aloud, a girl group created through ITV's Popstars: The Rivals. While still in the group, she began a solo career in April 2009, and between then and 2014, she released four studio albums – 3 Words (2009), Messy Little Raindrops (2010), A Million Lights (2012) and Only Human (2014). Collectively, the albums included ten singles, five of which – ""Fight for This Love, ""Promise This"", ""Call My Name"", ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""I Don't Care"" – reached the top position on the UK Singles Chart. Cheryl was the first British female solo artist to have five number-one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018.  Cheryl became a judge on the UK version of The X Factor in 2008. She mentored two of the eventual winners of the competition (Alexandra Burke in series five and Joe McElderry in series six), before resigning in 2011 and joining the panel of the American version, which she left during the auditions stage. She returned to judge series 11 and 12 of the UK version.  Cheryl has become a recognised and photographed style icon, being referred to as a ""fashionista"" by the press.[2] She has been photographed for the covers of British Vogue, Elle and Harper's Bazaar, and fronted cosmetic company L'Oréal from 2009 to 2018. Her net worth was estimated at £20 million in October 2014.[3][4] Cheryl was married to England footballer Ashley Cole from July 2006 to September 2010. She married Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014, and was granted a decree nisi from him in October 2016. From 2016 to 2018, she was in a relationship with One Direction singer Liam Payne, with whom she has a son born in March 2017.  Early life  Cheryl Ann Tweedy[5] was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 30 June 1983,[6] and grew up on council estates in the suburbs of Walker[7] and Heaton. She is the fourth of five children of Joan Callaghan,[8] and the first of her two children with Garry Tweedy following the collapse of her marriage to the father of her three other children. Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was 11 years old.[9]  At the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas.[10] Interested in dancing from an early age, she began sequence dancing at the age of four,[11] before joining The Royal Ballet's summer school at the age of nine.[12] She occasionally appeared doing dance recitals on different television shows in the UK, such as Gimme 5, in 1993.[13]  Career  2002–2009: Popstars: The Rivals and Girls Aloud  Cheryl (far right) with Girls Aloud performing at the Capital Radio Help a London Child fundraiser, 2005.  Cheryl auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, which aimed to create a boy band and a girl group to compete for the Christmas number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. She sang ""Have You Ever"" in her audition,[14] and was one of twenty contestants (ten girls and ten boys) chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. The finalists performed live on Saturday evenings, with one gender performing each week, and each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the five-piece groups emerged. Cheryl was in danger of elimination twice, surviving over Emma Beard[15] and Aimee Kearsley[16] in consecutive performing weeks. On 30 November 2002, she was the first contestant to qualify for the girl group, and was joined by Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to form Girls Aloud, following the final public vote.[17] The group's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one over boy band One True Voice's ""Sacred Trust / After You're Gone"".[18] Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between being formed as a band and achieving a number one single.[19]  Girls Aloud released their debut album Sound of the Underground in May 2003,[20] which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles ""I'll Stand by You"", ""Walk This Way"", and ""The Promise"" charted at number one. Two of their albums reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album The Sound of Girls Aloud and 2008's Out of Control, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold.[21] They also achieved seven certified albums and were nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for ""The Promise"".[22] The group's musical style was pop, but throughout their career they experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim,[23] due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group amassed a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for ""Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group"" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone.[24][25] Girls Aloud took a hiatus in 2009 in the pursuit of solo projects, saying they would reunite for a new studio album in 2010,[26] but this did not materialise.  2008–2011: Television endeavours, 3 Words and Messy Little Raindrops  In 2008, Cheryl replaced Sharon Osbourne as a judge for the fifth series of The X Factor alongside creator Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh. She was given the girls category (made up of female solo contestants aged 16 to 25) and subsequently ended up as the winning judge when Alexandra Burke was crowned the winner of series five on 13 December.[27] She returned for the sixth series in 2009 and was given the boys category (made up of male solo contestants aged 16 to 25).[28] She was the winning judge for a second consecutive year when Joe McElderry won on 13 December.[29] Cowell referred to her as ""one of the best I've ever worked with.""[30] Cheryl returned for the seventh series in 2010 and mentored the girls category again.[31] This was the first series in which she was not the winning mentor, when Rebecca Ferguson finished as runner-up to Matt Cardle, who was mentored by Minogue. In 2011, Cheryl joined Cowell, L.A. Reid, and Paula Abdul on the judging panel of the American version of The X Factor.[32] After a three-week stint she departed the series.[33] Cowell said that the reason why she left was because he offered her a place on the 2011 series of the UK version and he felt that she would have been more comfortable there.[34] Cheryl did not return to the UK version, as Tulisa had taken her place on the UK judging panel.[35] Nicole Scherzinger replaced her on the judging panel of the American version for the rest of season one.[36] In December 2012, Cheryl sued the American producers of The X Factor for $2.3 million (£1.4m). She received $1.8 million (£1.1m) for the first season, and then sued for $2 million (£1.25m) for the second season, plus additional damages.[37] In November 2013, Cheryl won for her settlement, for an undisclosed amount between her and producers Blue Orbit.[38]  Cheryl's first solo performance was on American rapper will.i.am's ""Heartbreaker"" in 2008. She was picked to appear as a dancer in the video after taking streetdancing classes during the filming of ITV2 series The Passions of Girls Aloud.[39] She was later asked by will.i.am to sing additional vocals on the track.[40] In April 2009, she started working on solo material,[41] and her debut album, 3 Words, was released in the UK on 26 October.[42] The album spent two weeks at number one,[43] and on 6 November, BPI certified the album platinum, denoting shipments of over 300,000 units; it later tripled this feat.[44] The first single from the album, ""Fight for This Love"", was written by Andre Merritt, Steve Kipner and Wayne Wilkins, and produced by Kipner and Wilkins. Following a performance on The X Factor live results show, ""Fight for This Love"" entered the UK and Irish charts at number one,[45] and in 2010, it went to number one in Denmark, Norway and Hungary,[46] and was later certified platinum in the UK.[44] It also became the fourth best-selling single of 2009 in the UK.[47] Cheryl's second single, ""3 Words"", which features will.i.am, went to number four in the UK and seven in Ireland.[48][49] In 2010, the single was released in Australia and charted at number five, and was certified platinum.[50] The third single, ""Parachute"", charted in the top five in both the UK and Ireland, and was certified gold in the UK.[51][49][44]  Cheryl started recording sessions for her second album in February 2010,[52] though in an interview on Alan Carr: Chatty Man, she said that some of the songs submitted for the record dated back to 3 Words.[53] The album was largely produced by Wayne Wilkins[54] and released on 29 October 2010 under the title Messy Little Raindrops. It features guest vocals from August Rigo, Dizzee Rascal, Travie McCoy, and will.i.am,[55] and debuted at number one in the UK, and at number two in Ireland.[51][49] It received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with a positive review of four out of five stars from Jon O'Brien of Allmusic.[56] On 19 August 2011, the album was certified platinum by BPI, with shipments in the UK exceeding 300,000.[44] The album's first single, ""Promise This"", is an up-tempo dance-pop song written by Wilkins, Priscilla Hamilton and Christopher Jackson,[57][58] which was released on 24 October 2010 and became her second number-one in the UK where it was certified gold.[59] ""The Flood"" was released as the album's second single and entered the charts after its official release at number 18.[51]  Cheryl was given a one-off television programme for ITV1, Cheryl Cole's Night In, which aired on 19 December 2009.[60] The programme, hosted by Holly Willoughby, featured music and interviews with Cheryl and some of her favourite performers. Alexandra Burke, Rihanna, Will Young, Snow Patrol and will.i.am made appearances.[61] The programme attracted 5 million viewers on its first airing.[62]  From May to July 2010, Cheryl was the opening act for The Black Eyed Peas at the British shows (as well as some European dates) of The E.N.D. World Tour.[63][64][65] Cheryl was interviewed during an episode of the fourth series of Piers Morgan's Life Stories, in which she discussed her marriage and divorce with Ashley Cole and her life-threatening battle with malaria. The show, which aired on 23 October 2010, drew an audience of 7.2 million, the highest figure in the chat show's history.[66]  2012–2013: A Million Lights, Girls Aloud reunion and tours  Cheryl's third studio album, A Million Lights, was released on 18 June 2012.[67] It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, selling 34,934 copies in its first week on sale, and was her first not to debut at number one in the UK and her first not to sell over 100,000 copies in its first week.[68] Her debut album 3 Words sold 125,000 copies while its follow-up Messy Little Raindrops sold around 105,000 copies.[68] A Million Lights was certified gold in the UK for shipments of 100,000 copies.[44] The lead single ""Call My Name"", became Cheryl's third number one single on the UK Singles Chart, with the sales of 152,001 digital copies. The song became 2012's fastest selling number one single on the UK Singles Chart until December of the same year,[69] when the winner of that year's series of The X Factor, James Arthur, sold 490,560 copies with his cover of Shontelle's ""Impossible"".[70] ""Call My Name"" sold a total of 417,000 copies in the UK, and was the 34th best-selling single of 2012 there.[71] ""Under the Sun"", the second single from the album, was released on 2 September 2012,[72][73] and peaked at number 13, becoming her seventh consecutive solo top-twenty single. To promote A Million Lights, Cheryl embarked on her first solo concert tour, A Million Lights Tour. The tour ran from 3 to 17 October 2012, and comprised 11 show dates: two in Ireland, one in Scotland and eight in England. She also did a set of meet and greets at each concert. The £350 offer included an autograph, a chance to meet her and a photograph with her backstage, with proceeds going towards her charity, The Cheryl Cole Foundation. The meet and greet ticket drew negative criticism from fans, who complained about the high price.[74][75]  On 4 June 2012, Cheryl performed a duet with Gary Barlow at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was organised and created by Barlow as part of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II and watched by millions worldwide.[76][77] In 2012, Cheryl returned to The X Factor as a guest mentor to help Barlow pick his contestants for the live shows of the competition. In November 2012, she was handed her own documentary entitled Cheryl: Access All Areas, which attracted 811,000 viewers on ITV2 and 177,000 on +1.[78]  In November 2012, after months of speculation, Girls Aloud reunited for the group's 10th anniversary. On 18 November, they released their comeback single, ""Something New"", which was also the official charity single for Children in Need 2012. The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart.[79] The group released their second greatest hits compilation, Ten, on 26 November 2012. The second single taken from Ten, ""Beautiful Cause You Love Me"", was released on 17 December.[80] A documentary entitled Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top aired on ITV1 on 15 December[81] and attracted 2.3 million viewers, a 10.5% share of the audience.[82] In 2013, the group embarked on Ten: The Hits Tour.[83][84] In March 2013, following the completion of the tour, Girls Aloud released a statement to confirm that they were splitting permanently.[85][86]  2014–2017: Only Human and The X Factor return  In June 2014, Cheryl debuted the first single from her fourth studio album Only Human, ""Crazy Stupid Love"", which features Tinie Tempah.[87] Later in the month, she performed at Capital FM's Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium.[88] ""Crazy Stupid Love"" was officially released in July and entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, selling 118,000 copies. It became Cheryl's fourth number one single on the chart, making her the third British female artist to achieve four numbers ones as a solo artist, after Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora.[89] The song also peaked at number one in Ireland.[49] The second single from Only Human, ""I Don't Care"", was released on 2 November and similarly to its predecessor debuted at number one in the UK, becoming Cheryl's fifth number one in the country. This made her the first British female to have five solo number one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018.[90][91] Only Human was released on 10 November and became Cheryl's fourth solo album to debut within the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[51][49] It was later certified silver in the UK.[44] The album's title track was released as its third and final single in March 2015. The song, which originally peaked at number 70 as an album cut in October 2014, failed to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart upon the single's release, therefore becoming Cheryl's lowest-charting single to date.[92]  In 2014, the singer also returned as a judge on the UK version of The X Factor for its 11th series to replace Sharon Osbourne, signing a £1.5 million contract.[93][94] She was joined by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Mel B on the judging panel. She was again selected to mentor the girls category, with her final act Lauren Platt coming fourth. In 2015, Cheryl returned to The X Factor for its 12th series; she was joined by Cowell and new judges Ora and Nick Grimshaw.[95] She was selected to mentor the groups category for the first time and her last remaining group Reggie 'n' Bollie reached the final finishing in second place. Cheryl announced her departure from The X Factor in April 2016, choosing to focus on her music career; she was replaced by Osbourne.[96] She guest appeared in the show's 14th series in 2017 as Cowell's adviser during the Judges' houses stage.[97]  2018: Fifth studio album and The Greatest Dancer  In July 2018, Cheryl revealed that her fifth studio album was ""pretty much finished"". She worked on the record with Naughty Boy and her former bandmate Nicola Roberts with whom she co-wrote every song.[98] The album's first single, ""Love Made Me Do It"", was released on 9 November 2018, and marked the singer's first release with new record label 3 Beat.[99] Cheryl's comeback was met with intense media scrutiny, and the single failed to make an impact on the charts peaking at number 19 in the UK and number 32 in Ireland.[100][101][49] Her performance of ""Love Made Me Do It"" on the 15th series of The X Factor was widely criticised in the media, with viewers arguing that its ""overtly sexual nature"" was ""inappropriate"" for pre-watershed television.[102][103]  Cheryl's record label announced that they intend to release a series of singles before releasing a full-length album, with two singles being scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.[104] The singer will serve as a dance captain alongside Matthew Morrison and Oti Mabuse on the new BBC One dance competition The Greatest Dancer, which will premiere on 5 January 2019.[105][106]  Other ventures  As a member of Girls Aloud, Cheryl teamed with Eylure to release five sets of false eyelashes, each set designed by a different member of the group. A range of festival-themed lashes followed in 2010, while limited edition ""10th Anniversary"" lash was released in 2012.[107][108] Similarly, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, each member designed a charm bracelet for Pandora, available as either a complete bracelet or a ""starter"" bracelet.[109] From 2009 to 2018, Cheryl served as the UK spokesperson for L'Oréal.[110][111]  Cheryl's first official book, entitled Through My Eyes, was published on 30 September 2010 by Bantam Press.[112][113] Through My Eyes purports to show her in the recording studio, backstage on tour, behind-the-scenes at The X Factor, at photo shoots and at award ceremonies. She said the book is ""filled with pictures that capture those moments, [her] memories and the people [she's] closest to"".[114] She is the subject of several unauthorised biographies,[115][116][117] as well as books detailing her relationship with and divorce from Ashley Cole.[118][119][120] Her autobiography, Cheryl: My Story, was published on 11 October 2012.[121] The book's content was about her relationships with Simon Cowell and her ex-husband Cole.[122][123] It has sold 275,000 copies as of February 2013 , generating £2.5 million in sales. In August 2014, Cheryl released her debut fragrance, StormFlower.[124]  Philanthropy  In 2004, Girls Aloud released a cover of The Pretenders' ""I'll Stand by You"" as the official single for the BBC's charity telethon Children in Need.[125] In 2007, the group announced a joint release of Aerosmith and Run DMC's ""Walk This Way"" with Sugababes as the official single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief. The song was recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis' request.[126][127]  In March 2009, Cheryl climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. The climb, organised by Gary Barlow, was also undertaken by fellow Girls Aloud member Kimberley Walsh, as well as Alesha Dixon, Fearne Cotton, Denise Van Outen, Chris Moyles, Ben Shephard, Ronan Keating and Barlow himself.[128][129] Between 3 February and 23 March 2009, Cheryl, Walsh, Barlow, Moyles and Cotton also raised money for Comic Relief by providing the voice for the BT Speaking Clock.[130] All nine celebrities reached the summit of Kilimanjaro on Saturday, 7 March 2009.[131] Cheryl, along with Cotton, Van Outen and Shephard, reached the summit first at sunrise. The trek raised £3.5 million for the charity. In February 2011, Cheryl launched her own charitable foundation with The Prince's Trust following a meeting with The Trust's President, HRH Charles, Prince of Wales. The Cheryl Cole Foundation is meant to provide vital funds for The Trust in the North East, which was set up to help disadvantaged young people from Cheryl's region.[132] On 13 June 2011, she auctioned 20 dresses with ASOS to raise funds for the foundation.[133]  In September 2011, Cheryl became the latest ""Forces' sweetheart"" when she visited British soldiers in Afghanistan.[134] On 23 January 2015, Cheryl announced the launch of a second charity, once again alongside The Prince's Trust. The charity was named Cheryl's Trust, and was set up with the aim of raising £2 million to build a centre, which will support up to 4000 disadvantaged young people in her native city of Newcastle.[135] To raise these funds, Cheryl has thus far teamed up with Prizeo in March 2015, setting up a styling session competition,[136] and also launched a limited edition Belgian Chocolate Bar with Greggs in August 2015; 5p proceeds from each sale being donated towards the trust.[137] In November 2016, she became the ambassador of the charity ChildLine.[138]  Artistry and influences  Cheryl has a mezzo-soprano range.[139] She spoke about her vocal ability saying, ""I am very aware of my ability, I know I'm no Mariah Carey but I think the emotion in the song is what matters.""[140] 3 Words was influenced by her appreciation for dance music and crosses from contemporary R&B, dance pop, house and a more general pop sound. Messy Little Raindrops uses a more dance pop sound than her previous album. A Million Lights, her third studio album also incorporates R&B and dance.[141] She incorporated Dubstep into A Million Lights, MTV citing ""Girl in the Mirror"" as an example.[142]  Cheryl has named Britney Spears and Beyoncé as a few of her inspirations, performance and fashion-wise.[143][144] She spoke on the reason Beyoncé was an influence on her, saying, ""I love Beyoncé, I just think she is such a beautiful person inside and out, apart from what she does on the stage which is obviously incredible and aspiration. I just like her as a woman. She's empowering.""[145] She has cited Lisa ""Left Eye""' Lopes, a former member of American band TLC, as another influence saying, ""I wanted to be [Lopes] – I used to wear baggy jeans and Timberlands like a tomboy.""[146] Other influences she has cited are Rihanna, whom she described as ""a perfect pop star"",[147] and Mary J. Blige, saying, ""Mary's voice sounds so grown up and you can hear that she has experienced a lot in her life, her songs help me with every heartache.""[148] Cheryl has influenced other artists, including Selena Gomez.[149] The 2006 Lily Allen song ""Cheryl Tweedy"" was written about her.[150]  Accusations of lip-syncing  It has been widely reported that Cheryl lip-syncs during live performances. Whilst performing ""Fight for this Love"" in 2009 on The X Factor, media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that she denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance.[151] In 2010, during her second performance on The X Factor, in which she performed ""Promise This"", she ""showcased her vocal and dancing skills with an energetic, raunchy routine that earned a standing ovation from her fellow judges.""[152] Similar to her 2009 performance of ""Fight for This Love"" on The X Factor, the media speculated whether she lip-synced or not. An ITV spokesperson insisted that she did not mime, although the performance was pre-recorded.[153]  In June 2012, Cheryl performed ""Call My Name"" with live vocals on The Voice UK. It was reported that The Voice executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would ""provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast."" As the performance began, she swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly elaborated routine. Following the broadcast, she received mixed comments from viewers, with a few accusing the singer of lip-synching, while others, including pop artists Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, she addressed the negative comments, and said that ""if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment.""[154]  Public image  A wax figure of Cheryl at the museum Madame Tussauds in London  Cheryl has become a recognised and photographed style icon.[155][156][157] Fashion magazine British Vogue praised her style saying: ""Her wardrobe choices have become as successful as her singles – while filming for The X Factor, she had fashion fans watching her every sartorial move and was snapped wearing a string of fashion-forward outfits from Givenchy and Preen, to McQueen and Missoni.""[158] In both 2009 and 2010, she was named the best dressed woman by Glamour Magazine, after 14,000 votes from the magazine's readers were counted.[159] She has been photographed for the covers of British Vogue,[157] Elle and Harper's Bazaar. In March 2010, Cheryl was declared by research company Millward Brown as the second most powerful celebrity in Britain.[160]  Cheryl topped FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World in 2009 and 2010. She has won Glamour Women of the Year Awards for TV Personality and Best Dressed[161] and Style Network Award for Best Dressed Woman and Style Icon of the Decade.[155] In February 2009, she appeared on the cover of British Vogue. The media coverage of her appearance in the magazine boosted the magazine's circulation to 240,000, its best ever February figure.[162] She appeared on the November 2009 cover of the UK's Elle magazine. In October 2010, a wax statue of her was added to the gallery of Madame Tussauds London at a cost of approximately £150,000.[163]  Personal life  Cheryl began dating England and Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole in September 2004, announcing their engagement after he proposed in Dubai in June 2005.[164] The couple were married at a ceremony at Barnet, north west London on 15 July 2006.[165] They signed an exclusive deal with OK!, reportedly worth £1 million, regarding the rights of the photographs.[166] On 23 February 2010, Cheryl announced she was separating from Cole,[167][168] and on 26 May, she filed for divorce at London's High Court citing ""unreasonable behaviour"" from her estranged husband. The divorce papers state that Cole admitted being unfaithful to Cheryl with a number of other women.[169] She was granted a decree nisi on 3 September.[170] She continued to use her married name, but later began using the mononym Cheryl for her music releases.[171]  On 7 July 2014, Cheryl married French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini after a three-month courtship.[172][173][174] Following their separation, Cheryl began dating singer Liam Payne in early 2016,[175][176] before being granted a decree nisi from Fernandez-Versini on 20 October 2016.[177] On 22 March 2017, she gave birth to her son with Payne.[178][179][180] Cheryl and Payne announced they had ended their relationship in July 2018.[181]  In December 2016, Cheryl appeared on the BBC One genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, during which she researched her maternal family.[182] Research shows that her paternal line is from Tyneside[183] and that there were a number of coal miners amongst Cheryl's forebears. When tracing further back, in one of the branches of her paternal line, researchers find that her ancestry includes several mariners.[184] The investigation into Cheryl's maternal line shows that her grandmother, Olga Ridley, was one of twin girls born to Edith Annie Burton, the housekeeper for a widower named Joseph Ridley who already had a number of children from his marriage.[185] Joseph Ridley had fought in World War I in the Durham Light Infantry as a Pioneer in France and, from an examination of the census, before the war he had been a Grocery Warehouseman.[185]  Assault conviction  On 11 January 2003, Cheryl was involved in an altercation with a nightclub toilet attendant, Sophie Amogbokpa, and subsequently charged with racially aggravated assault over the incident.[186][187] At her trial on 20 October she was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm but cleared of the racially aggravated assault charge,[188] and sentenced to 120 hours of community service. She was ordered to pay her victim £500 in compensation, as well as £3,000 prosecution costs. Judge Richard Howard said, ""This was an unpleasant piece of drunken violence which caused Sophie Amogbokpa pain and suffering.""[188]  Filmography  Discography  Tours  Solo tours  As solo supporting act  Awards and nominations  See also"	0
"Mother is the story of a couple's relationship that is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. From filmmaker Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream), Mother! stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in this riveting psychological thriller about love, devotion and sacrifice. (2017)  OSCAR-WINNING actress Jennifer Lawrence has suggested the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida were signs of “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for electing Donald Trump and not believing in man-made climate change.  Lawrence, who is promoting her new drama Mother!, appeared on British network Channel 4, where she discussed topics ranging from the movie to the gender pay gap and Mr Trump.  “It’s scary,” the actress responded to the interviewer’s assertion that there was “an end-of-days feeling” across the world and especially in the US.  “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming. I don’t even recognise it. It’s also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.”  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the reporter noted – to which Lawrence replied that “it was really startling” Mr Trump was elected.  She then suggested the recent hurricanes devastating Texas and nearing Florida may have been prompted by Mr Trump winning the presidency.  “You know, you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature’s rage and wrath,” Lawrence said.  Lawrence later said the conversation topics of Mr Trump and US politics were “really polarising and upsetting.”  “You know, I’ve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” she said.  After being asked whether she finds Mr Trump confusing, the actress fired back, saying, “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is.”  Lawrence has never been shy about sharing her opinions on the President.  In 2015, when Trump had just launched his presidential campaign, she said a victory by him would “be the end of the world,” during an Entertainment Weekly interview.  Social media users were quick to hit out at the star for politicising a natural disaster.  What a dumbass!! Typical Hollywood snowflake. Should stick to memorizing lines and not using brain. #JenniferLawrence #MAGA — George Branton (@GeorgeBranton) September 8, 2017  Opens twitter  Reads, ""Jennifer Lawrence said hurricanes are punishment for voting for Trump.""

"Our not-so-secret secret is that we expect most, if not all, of our products to work double-duty. Cheek stain doubles as lip pigment, and brown eyeshadow helps fill in our brows. But, there's one tube in our makeup bags that could do so much more: concealer.  What we normally slather onto zits and undereye circles has many other applications. We tapped makeup artist Tina Turnbow to show us five techniques that turn our old cover-up into a highlighter, brow accent, lip definer, and more.  Ahead, find her step-by-step instructions for using concealer to get a gorgeous face. Don't you just love a good multitasker?  Hello, Highlighter  If you haven't plunked down the cash for a contour kit with a shadow powder and highlighter, your concealer could sub in a pinch. ""Make sure you're using one that's about two shades lighter than your skin tone,"" Turnbow says.    Start with your contour powder. Find your cheekbones, and slide the pigment just below them in a downward motion. ""It should end a couple of inches away from the corner of your mouth,"" Turnbow says.  Product used: Kevyn Aucoin The Sculpting Powder ($44; sephora.com)    Next, apply your concealer. ""It should create a halo effect around your eyes,"" Turnbow says. Use your fingers to pat it on along the tops of your cheekbones. Then, bring it up until it reaches just above the tip of your eyebrows. ""Look for a concealer with a radiant aspect to it,"" she says. ""This will help attract the light.""  Product used: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, ($29; nars.com)    For your nose contour, use the same shadow you swept under your cheekbones. Focus it along the two edges of the bone. ""Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,"" Turnbow says.    Your concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. ""When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,"" Turnbow says. ""People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there.""    The result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do. It's contouring that works in real life—not the crazy sculpting you see on the red carpet all the time. [Read the full story on Refinery29!]"	0

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually. But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less ""this'll happen ASAP."" “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”  A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”  Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.  In their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, ""No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.""  At an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, ""I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”"	1
"Barack Obama tried to teach the nation how to say goodbye on Tuesday night with his farewell address.  The 44th President of the United States addressed the country from his hometown of Chicago in his final speech as Commander-in-Chief.

Cannasos reports:By Jacqueline AustinThe Nobel winner thanked his doctors and family for their support through his brain cancerordeal. He also thanked Terrance ‘Scooby’ Williams of Dr. Green’s Greenery, a pot dispensary in Oakland, CA, for helping him find the right strain of cannabis.Carter told his medicinal regiment to Sawyer“I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.“Edibles are also good when traveling when smoking is not permitted.”The future is bright for the 91-year-old humanitarian.

"TV host Anne-Marie Losique has again defended Ben Affleck after a 2004 interview of the pair went viral amid the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  Appearing on Weekend Sunrise on Sunday, Anne-Marie insisted that her relations with Ben were purely 'professional,' and that he 'never asked me to go to his room or anything like that.'  In the video from 2004, the journalist is seen sitting on Ben's lap as she interviews him, the actor tells her she should go 'topless' then puts his head on her chest.  'He never asked me to go to his room or anything like that': TV host Anne-Marie Losique defends Ben Affleck over their VERY intimate interview... amid the Harvey Weinstein scandal  'In all my career, I never go roam around in rooms and suites of actors and producers by the way,' Anne-Marie said.  'What I did with Ben and what we did, which was completely mutual, it was in front of cameras, and studio executives, agents, other journalists etc, and in front of like 20 people,' she said.  'It started when the cameras rolled, it stopped when the cameras stopped rolling.'  Speaking up: Appearing on Weekend Sunrise on Sunday, Anne-Marie insisted that her relations with Ben were purely 'professional'  She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more.  'That's it. The rest we had very courteous conversation, very respectful. He never asked me to go to his room or anything like that and never, nothing like that!'  She insisted the pair played the 'game' in interviews for ten years and she said she didn't like that the 2004 interview was being associated with the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  Anne-Marie also said she wasn't a 'victim,' despite what people might think.  All for show: She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more  Making headlines: Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein (pictured) drama, Anne-Marie said she was once asked up to his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away'  Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein drama, Anne-Marie said he once asked her to visit his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away.'  'Professional settings have to stay professional,' she said, but defended his victims who unknowingly went up to his hotel suite with him.  'When one says no, it's no,' she added.  Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben.  'This was for the camera. You have to understand that we have done dozens and dozens of interviews like that. It was for a show I was producing, so I was not at all a victim,' she said.  The video starts by showing Anne-Marie sitting on Ben's lap facing him as he's heard saying: 'They would like it better if you did the show topless.'  Having her say: Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben  He then turns her around so she can face the camera before he places his head on her chest.  'This is a lovely perfume you have on,' he says as the two hold each other.  He then says: 'You usually show a lot more cleavage than this. What's the story? Why are you covering it up today?'  'It's Sunday morning,' she responds.  'It's Sunday morning? That never stopped you before from getting them ti****s out,' Ben says back to her in the interview that lasted for more than five minutes.  But despite what the video appears to show, Anne-Marie said it 'has been blown out of proportion.'  She told the publication she had an uncomfortable encounter with Harvey, years ago.  'He did invite me once at the Toronto Film Festival to go up to his suite for an interview. Of course I did not go. He said, ""I would be more comfortable in my suite."" I said, ""Umm, no."" I am not saying something would have happened, but I made sure nothing happened,' she said.  Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party.  Annamarie Tendler, who is the author of The Daily Face and Pin It, asked for an apology from the actor over the alleged incident in a Tweet on Wednesday.  Claims: Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party  'I would also love to get an apology from Ben Affleck who grabbed my a** at a Golden Globes party in 2014,' she Tweeted.  She followed that tweet up with more detail, saying: 'He walked by me, cupped my butt and pressed his finger into my crack.  'I guess he tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way and oops touched my butt instead of my lower back?  'Like most women in these situations I didn't say anything but I have thought a lot about what I'd say if I ever saw him again,' she concluded.  Writer and comedian, Jen Statsky, who is known for her work on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, also tweeted about Annamarie's allegations.  Controversial: Ben had made a statement condemning Harvey's alleged abusive actions, saying he was 'saddened and angry' over the 'sickening' claims, which was slammed by Annamarie and Jen  'I was also at this party and *multiple* friends had this same exact experience,' she wrote on Twitter.  Ben had made a statement condemning Harvey's alleged abusive actions, saying he was 'saddened and angry' over the 'sickening' claims, which was slammed by Annamarie and Jen.  The statement was also slammed by Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, who called Ben a liar.  Actress Hilary Burton meanwhile said she 'didn't forget' when Ben 'grabbed her breasts' on TRL, in 2003.  He since apologised to Hilary, in a Tweet."	0
"Arie Luyendyk Jr. drew the ire of Bachelor Nation on Monday’s dramatic season 22 finale when he broke off his engagement to Becca Kufrin on camera, weeks after proposing — admitting he still had feelings for runner-up Lauren Burnham.  But the 36-year-old race car driver stands by the decision to have the emotional and awkward breakup filmed for a number of reasons, chief among them the chance it gave Kufrin to move into a starring role on next season of The Bachelorette.

Seems like a private conversation. We don’t belong in this conversation,” said Bachelor Ben Higgins. Added Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher, “STOP.FILMING.HER.”  How did this breakup end up on camera?

Not great.  “It was embarrassing the way he broke up with me with the full cameras and crew around,” the 27-year-old the Minnesota-based publicist told PEOPLE exclusively for this week’s issue (on newsstands Friday).  “There was a better and more tactful way to do it,” she added. “A breakup is hard enough, and to have it all filmed and have to re-watch it and know that people all across the country are watching you get your heart broken, it is embarrassing. It’s not fun. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It was like a slap in the face.”  That being said, Kufrin just wants to put that chapter of her life behind her.  “I went through all the emotions. I was mad for awhile, I was so sad and down for awhile, I was p—– for awhile,” she said. “At this point, I want this chapter of Arie to be done and close it and put it on the shelf and put it away.”  “I’m still going to feel a sense of compassion for him because I did love him,” she continued. “But at this point, I want him to be happy, I want to be done and not have to worry about them anymore.

Emmy Award nomination is always an interesting time of year. This year that is perhaps even more true as The Emmy’s made history when Laverne Cox became the first transgender* actor to receive an Emmy nomination (Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series) for her portrayal of Sophia Burset on the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. This is certainly cause for a celebration – we’re celebrating, celebrate with us.  We’re happy for Laverne Cox despite The ViP team (it’s unanimous) holding the unpopular opinion that Cox’s nomination is more political than earned. We’re here for it! Don’t get us wrong, we just also have to be honest. We don’t feel she beat out other potential candidates on OITNB for this category – not with screen time and not with her performance. You’ll also note that while we love, adore and admire (a couple of us are even obsessed with) Kerry Washington just the same – she didn’t make our list either.  Those aren’t the only changes we made to this year’s Emmy’s nod list. Before we get into what should’ve happened let’s talk about what actually happened.  Orange is the New Black dominated the comedy category and helped offer some color to a very white ballot. The binge-watch favorite earned 12 nominations in all, including a nomination for Best Comedy Series. Uzo Aduba (Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren) and Natasha Lyonne (Nicky Nichols) joined Cox in the Outstanding Guest Actress category (the only category with more than one person of color in it), while Taylor Schilling (Piper Kerman) and Kate Mulgrew (Galina “Red” Reznikov) got nods in Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively.  In the past few years, nominations have crept away from networks and toward cable television, which allows for gritty dramas, edgy comedies and a lower season episode count, which means overall less work for writers and production teams and some network folks aren’t happy about it. Netflix has recently joined cable as an outlet for intense storytelling. Between its critically acclaimed series Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, Netflix garnered a total of 31 nominations, impressive for a network only in its second year at the Emmy’s. Cable provider HBO led the networks with a whopping 99 nominations, including 19 for the top-nominated program Game of Thrones.  Even critics’ staple favorites like CBS’s The Good Wife came away with fewer nominations than expected. While nods were secured for Best Actress category frequenter Julianna Margulies (Alicia Florrick), supporting actor Josh Charles (Will Gardner, whose on-screen death came as one of the biggest television shockers of the season), supporting actress Christine Baranski (Diane Lockhart) and guest actor Dylan Baker (cringe-worthy client Colin Sweeney), the program was noticeably missing from the Best Drama Series category. Also noticeably absent from the list was Fox’s new breakout hit, Sleepy Hollow.  Some traditional network shows, however, managed to make the cut. Shonda Rhimes’ fast-paced fan favorite Scandal came away with a Best Actress nod for Kerry Washington’s Olivia Pope and guest actor nods for Joe Morton (Rowan “Papa” Pope) and Kate Burton (Sally Langston).  While Canada hasn’t seemed to have much luck with the Emmy’s (Orphan Black’s Tatiana Maslany), British programs like Sherlock, Downton Abbey and Luther (Idris Elba’s Best Actor in a Miniseries nomination makes his fourth Emmy nod overall) have all made more than one appearance in this year’s Emmy nominations.  Theater apparently also makes good television, as screen adaptations of the plays The Normal Heart and The Trip Bountiful earned Emmy nods. The Normal Heart, which aired on HBO, dominated the Best Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie category, with Jim Parsons, Joe Mantello, Alfred Molina and Matt Bomer taking up four of the six available spots. Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts earned nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Cicely Tyson earned a Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie nod for her work in The Trip Bountiful, impressive since the movie aired on Lifetime, which does not traditionally do well in the Emmy race.  Emmy nominations often belong to a closed group (check the lists for best comedy and drama series’ actors for the past five years — the same names come up a lot). And so often the Emmy’s get it wrong. Actually we couldn’t remember the last time The Emmy’s got it right. So, The Visibility Project staff sat down, brainstormed and got to work on fixing the 2014 Emmy’s nomination list. We’ve done a little bit of category shifting in some places, based on quality of performance and the fact that British shows count as shows and not miniseries in our minds.  As our staff writer, Kylee pointed out during our decision-making process, #wethegods, we’ve fixed the list our way and how we see fit. We stuck to the main categories so we added an honorable mentions list of actors that would definitely make the cut if we’d fixed the full list. Our picks are below – enjoy!  Best Drama Series  House of Cards  Breaking Bad  Sleepy Hollow  The Good Wife  Orphan Black  Best Comedy Series  Orange is the New Black  Modern Family  The Mindy Project  Parks and Recreation  Brooklyn 99  Best Actress in a Comedy Series  Uzo Aduba, Orange is the New Black  Dannielle Brooks, Orange is the New Black  Mindy Kaling, The Mindy Project  Melissa McCarthy, Mike & Molly  Amy Poehler, Parks and Recreation  Samira Wiley, Orange is the New Black  Best Actor in a Comedy Series  Louis CK, Louie  Don Cheadle, House of Lies  Neil Patrick Harris, How I Met Your Mother  William H.

DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith have reunited for their first official show in 12 years.  The duo are celebrating a short concert run with Friday and Saturday’s MTV Presents Summerblast Music Festival 2017 in Croatia, then at Sunday’s Livewire Festival in Blackpool, England, though they are hoping for more.  “I looked at Jeff and he was getting old, man, and I was like, ‘I can’t do this to this boy,’” Smith joked to Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier. about the decision to have a reunion. “It was time. LL hit me [up and] was like, ‘Dude, I’m telling you, it’s time. You have no idea the love that’s out there.’ I was listening to L like, ‘All right, I need to do it.’”  “Now I got the bug,” Smith continued. “I was on fire last night. It was the first time being on stage in a while. I blew my voice out a little — I do that all the time. I just can’t contain myself on stage.”  As for Jazzy Jeff, he said that his job is to rein in Smith when he gets “overly excited.”  “I’m the little man in his ear telling him to calm down, just slow down,” he said. “You have to have fun with it and a lot of it is making sure that you’re loose and calm on stage.”  However, while the two of them are loving the tour and even debuted a new track, “Get Lit,” on Sunday, they said that this didn’t mean there was going to be a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion.  “Stuff had to go really wrong for there to be a Fresh Prince reunion special,” Smith said. “Like, I don’t know what would have to happen! Nah man, you can’t touch stuff like that. It’s so nostalgic for people — I’m not going nowhere near that.”	0

In case you wanted proof of your waning youth, Thursday marks the 10th anniversary of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline’s wedding — a day when a promising young pop star and a dude nicknamed “Meat Pole” decided to throw caution to the wind and say “I do.”  “Ten years — it totally freaks me out,” says wedding planner Alyson Fox, reflecting on the September 18, 2004, nuptials. The day marked Fox’s first (and only) celebrity wedding. While it was originally planned as a big October wedding at the Bacara in Santa Barbara, things rapidly changed after the paparazzi figured out the date and location. Fox was left with about 10 days to organize a completely new, surprise wedding — and, not trusting any other venue to keep the secret, she held it at her own house.  Most Britney fans probably don’t celebrate her short-lived marriage’s anniversary; some even see it as a key moment in a downward spiral from which she has only recently recovered. Still, though Britney filed for divorce in 2006, Fox holds that marriage dear.  TIME spoke to Fox about the whirlwind wedding, young love and the groomsmens’ infamous white Juicy velour “pimp” tracksuits.  TIME: Britney and Kevin Federline’s engagement was huge. Did you think that this would be one of the biggest weddings-  Alyson Fox: —of my career? Yes, I mean, she is Britney Spears. I first interviewed with Felicia, her assistant for years, and I didn’t know who I was meeting with, just that it was a VIP… I met Britney and her mom the next day and they all couldn’t be nicer. The sweetest. I mean they’re from the South. Britney’s so polite, she kept calling me Miss Alyson, and I was like, ‘Oh my God don’t do that; that makes me feel old.’  And then you met Kevin.  They were like any young couple. Very much in love, very touchy feely.  What was the original wedding going to be like?  They came up with a list of 200 to 250 people, and we thought the Bacara would be great. We were designing the most beautiful but not over the top, elegant but shabby chic, gorgeous but fun event… It was a really fun experience. I have not one negative thing to say until we had to move the whole wedding.  So what happened?  A publication printed the location and date of the wedding. I got a call from a very unhappy Kevin. [Unhappy at the situation not her.] Even though I told them that we had the best security team and it could still go on without a hitch, they didn’t want 100 million people standing outside trying to take pictures, ruining the intimacy and privacy of that event. So we had to go to Plan B, and we had to do it fast.  You had a “Plan B”?  Well, we planned it in 10 days or less… Everything was already in the works, Monique Lhuillier was making all the gowns that were basically ready, all the vendors were in place for the big wedding — we just didn’t have a location. In that week we decided we can’t do it at a hotel, we can’t do a venue because people were going to know. We limited the guest list to the two families and the wedding party, and then we talked to Britney and Kevin about doing a surprise wedding. Nobody would know.  Not even Britney’s mom?  No. Nobody knew… We told everyone and our vendors we were having an engagement party. We tried to use every vendor we could who was going to help at the wedding.  And you would throw it at your house in Studio City?  Well, their place wasn’t ready yet… The vendors made the house look stunning. It was so beautiful. I only wish they could have had more people… Every person who walked in that night, we handed then an invitation, they opened it up and it said “surprise!” you are here for the wedding and not the engagement party. And we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos…  Tuxedos? I thought the men were wearing those white Juicy velour jumpsuits…  No! That’s what they left the house in. They were in tuxedos and gowns. Everybody made such a big deal about that, but that’s what Juicy did for every celebrity who got married. They’d send them the cute little tracksuits. I asked Britney and Kevin what they wanted printed on the back, and Britney said, “Maids! Maids will be cute!” And it was. It was cute! And he said “Pimps” which was adorable… People are closed-minded. It was a joke, it was for fun. It was Juicy tracksuits! 10 years ago people would have given anything for a Juicy tracksuit.  You must not have gotten a lot of sleep that week.  Oh I didn’t sleep that week. And I didn’t sleep the week after, because there were all these stories going on [at the time] that they weren’t really married, and all this B.S. People are going to think what they’re going to think, but I know the truth. They were wonderful people and I’ll say that until the day I die. To this day I don’t talk to a lot of people about it because I still feel protective over them. Unfortunately it didn’t work out — but what is it, 60% of marriages that don’t?

Parisian-based fashion house, KENZO, has named Britney Spears as its newest spokesperson, with a campaign called Kenzo Presents Britney Spears, with its own hashtag, #kenzolovesbritney. After several teaser shots of the new campaign—officially called “La Collection Memento N°2“—KENZO and Spears finally unveiled their partnership on their social media channels.  The campaign, shot by legendary photographer Peter Lindbergh, focuses on the idea of cultural icons—something that Spears wholeheartedly embodies. With a heavy focus on denim and the quintessential KENZO motifs, the collection is vast and wide ranging for both men, women and some pieces that may be worn by both genders. One of those motifs, for which KENZO had become internationally recognized, is “the jumping tiger,” developed by Kenzo Takada in the 1970s.  “I was really flattered when KENZO approached me to the face of their 50th anniversary line,” began Spears. “I love the brand, and with denim being a big part of this collection, it made it that much more appealing to me since denim is such a part of my own style.” (Who could ever forget her matching denim-on-denim moment on the Grammy’s red carpet with then-beau Justin Timberlake?)  The collection elevates the ever-popular “athleisure” trend. For the main ad campaign shot, Britney Spears wears the Cropped ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Sweatshirt, the Denim ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Denim Baseball Cap (already sold out), The Mini Denim ‘Kanagawa Wave’ Rucksack and the Denim Shorts.  The collaboration certainly is a match made in heaven. Spears’ is a timeless, American icon, and her reign as the queen of pop will surely last generations to come.  All photos from KENZO website.	0
And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

"The possibility of Game of Thrones' Daenerys Targaryen and her late husband Khal Drogo sitting on the Iron Throne together may be impossible given what happened in the show's first season, but Emilia Clarke gave fans that image to savor when she and Jason Momoa, the actors behind the characters, reunited at a Game of Thrones cast party this weekend. Clarke and Momoa each posted shots of them posing by the Throne. They also got straight-up gushy about each other in their captions, as they have in the past.  ""FYI...This is the closest you’ll ever get to me attempting ‘that lift’ from dirty dancing,"" Clarke wrote on her Insta. ""Yes, my man is sitting. Yes, there’s no lake. And yes, I have no idea I’m NOT being raised above his head. (Id like to take a moment to thank alcohol for giving me courage to attempt this. Ever.)""  Momoa wrote the most adoring comment on her 'gram: ""Epic night love u my love enjoy every moment so proud of you.""  Instagram  He posted several shots of them too, writing, ""Moon of my life @emilia_clarke every time I leave you my face hurts from smiling to much. I Fucking love you forever. Aloha j""  Clarke liked the shot:  Instagram  Both Momoa and Clarke shared shots from the party of them with other cast members, hinting they may have been at the wrap party for the series. ""I’m so grateful to be apart of the greatest show on earth. I’m honored to be able to come to Ireland and celebrate with my friends. I’m just here for kisses and hugs and The black stuff 😜😜😜😜,"" Momoa wrote, perhaps to debunk rumors his character may be making a surprise last-season appearance. ""Mahalo David and Dan you are legends. Congrats to the talented crew and cast.""  Instagram  Clarke told Vanity Fair that she shot Daenerys' final scene earlier this year. ""It fucked me up,"" she said. ""Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone’s mouth of what Daenerys is... """	0

"Hold onto your sanity, Jelena shippers, because your two favorite people might be friends again. According to reports, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have been hanging out as friends over the last couple weeks. They've been hanging out with groups of mutual friends, TMZ reports, and The Weeknd is apparently totally cool with it/knows all about it. So are Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber friends for real this time? Did Bieber perform his song ""Friends"" for her and was like, ""Selena, girl, can we be friends plz?"" Maybe!  The exes were reportedly seen platonically hanging out at Gomez's house in Studio City with a group of friends this past Sunday, Oct. 22. TMZ released photos that reportedly show Gomez pulling into her house on Sunday night and Bieber's car following just 10 minutes after. There's also a photo of what appears to be Gomez and Bieber walking out of her house, but only the tattooed arm of a guy can be seen in the photo, so it's hard to confirm that it's actually the Biebs. Still, fans are completely losing their minds, seeing as if their beloved Jelena won't get back together in a romantic way, friendship is a good second.  Try not to faint, Jelena fans, but these are the reported photos of Gomez and Bieber hanging out this past weekend.  Some fans are like, ""OMG YASSSSSS,"" while others are like, ""Meh.""  Gomez and Bieber reportedly got back in touch around the time she revealed she had a kidney transplant earlier this summer.  Gomez revealed the news in a moving Instagram post on Sept. 14 that read,  I'm very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn't promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of. So I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health. I honestly look forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these past several months as I have always wanted to do with you. Until then I want to publicly thank my family and incredible team of doctors for everything they have done for me prior to and post-surgery. And finally, there aren't words to describe how I can possibly thank my beautiful friend Francia Raisa. She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me. I am incredibly blessed. I love you so much sis. Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made. For more information regarding Lupus please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org/ -by grace through faith  One of Gomez's best friends, actress Francia Raisa, was her kidney donor, and Gomez penned a beautiful thank you to her in her Instagram post. Raisa posted about the experience on her own Instagram shortly after Gomez. She said,  I am beyond grateful that God would trust me with something that not only saved a life, but changed mine in the process. This was part of our story, and we will share it soon, but what is important now is that this is not the only story.For more information regarding Lupus, please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org -- Love you sis, so glad we’re on this journey together. ❤️ xx  In August, Bieber released the single ""Friends"" with BloodPop. It's about wanting to be friends with an ex, and fans immediately thought ""Friends"" was about Selena Gomez.  BloodPop® on YouTube  The ""Friends"" lyrics go:  Do you wonder why I've been callin'? Like I've got ulterior motives  No, we didn't end this so good  But you know we had something so good  So I'm wonderin'  Can we still be friends? (oh) Can we still be friends? (oh)  Doesn't have to end  And if it ends, can we be friends?  Can we be friends? Can we be friends?  Sounds to me like someone is trying to platonically reconcile with an ex! But honestly, these two probably don't write all of their songs about each other... I'm just sayin'. Gomez has a new single coming out on Oct. 25. called ""Wolves."" She released the ""Wolves"" lyrics on Oct. 24 and they're super romantic. Fans are assuming it's about her current boyfriend, The Weeknd, and they're pumped. But, it's safe to say Jelena shippers are having a good day today."	1
