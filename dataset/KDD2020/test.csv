"Chris Evans and Jenny Slate's relationship was beloved by the internet. Theo Wargo/Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Chris Evans and Jenny Slate have broken up again, according to the New York Times .  Evans and Slate had an on-again, off-again relationship that the internet loved.  INSIDER spoke with relationship experts to find out why getting back together with an ex is almost always a bad idea.  Once again, Chris Evans and Jenny Slate have broken up, according to a recent New York Times profile of Evans.  The profile doesn't go into too much detail as to what caused the breakup. In fact, it is only mentioned at all because Evans refers to a feminist text, ""The Mother of All Questions"" by Rebecca Solnit, that he read while dating Slate. But anyone who has ever experienced any sort of on-again-off-again relationships like Evans and Slate's likely has some inkling as to what happened. After all, getting back with an ex rarely, if ever, works out quite the way you'd like it to.  INSIDER spoke with relationship experts to find out why.  It encourages an unhealthy behavior pattern.  ""Jenny Slate and Chris Evans have broken up before, and there is a really good chance they're going to get back together — and break up again,"" relationship expert April Masini, who hosts an online relationship advice forum, told INSIDER. ""When breakups become the way that you deal with relationship conflicts, you're in a bad behavioral pattern.""  This can become a source of strain in one's daily life. ""Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,"" Masini said.  It makes everything more confusing.  Often, ending a relationship isn't as clear-cut as many of us would like it to be — if you care about someone deeply, the act of breaking up with them isn't going to change that. This can make it easy to think that getting back with an ex is a good idea.  ""When a couple does get back together, what it tells you is that there is a lot that's good and a lot that works,"" Susan Winter, a relationship expert and best-selling author, told INSIDER. ""But there are also issues that haven't been fixed. Chances are, [Evans and Slate] like each other as people, which makes this tough.""  As anyone who has reunited with an ex can probably attest, it also tends to be more trouble than it's worth.  ""Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,"" relationship expert Rachel DeAlto told INSIDER. ""In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.""  Evans and Slate reportedly started their relationship while filming the movie ""Gifted."" Fox Searchlight  It's possible that the reconciliation is to benefit outside sources, rather than the ones in the relationship.  Have you ever gotten back together with an ex simply because you're in the same friend group, and your friends think you were so great together, and, well, it's just easier to be together? Evans and Slate may have been following the same line of thinking.  ""They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,"" Masini told INSIDER. ""And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.""  Not everyone has fans, of course, but most people have outside influences — like friends and family — who can shape our thinking and behavior without us realizing it. So, if you're ever thinking about getting back together with an ex, think about if it's something that you really want, or just something you have been told to want.  A breakup can incite positive change — if you stick to it.  The good news? As tough as they are, breakups can often lead to some positive change.  ""A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,"" Winter said. ""The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality. I've seen it help people get into sobriety, I've seen it make philanderers get clear on the reason why they couldn't commit, I've seen people take anger management and sensitivity courses. I've seen all types of change.""  No word yet on if Evans and Slate will heed this advice — but, chances are, it's something that we can all benefit from hearing."	0

"That '70s Show is an American television period sitcom that originally aired on Fox from August 23, 1998 to May 18, 2006. The series focused on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in fictional Point Place, Wisconsin from May 17, 1976 to December 31, 1979.[1]  The main teenage cast members were Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon and Wilmer Valderrama. The main adult cast members were Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong and Tanya Roberts.  Cast [ edit ]  Teens [ edit ]  Topher Grace as Eric Forman (seasons 1–7; uncredited special guest season 8): Eric is a nice guy, geeky, physically slight and somewhat clumsy. He is a smart-aleck with a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. He convinces his parents to let his best friend Steven Hyde move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. His father, Red, is always hard on him. For seven seasons Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor Donna Pinciotti. He decides to become a teacher after high school and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa. Although mentioned in every episode, he does not appear during the final season until the end of the series finale.  Mila Kunis as Jackie Burkhart: The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, spoiled rich, selfish, often times annoying immature girl. She likes to give thoughtless and superficial advice, which occasionally turns out to be correct. As the series progresses she becomes more genuine, after her father, a crooked politician, goes to jail and her fortunes take a reversal. Partly as a result of these changes, Donna and she become better friends. By the end of the series, Jackie had dated three of the four males of the group: Kelso, Hyde and Fez.  Ashton Kutcher as Michael Kelso (seasons 1–7; special guest season 8): The dumb pretty boy of the group wants to coast through life on his good looks. Often referred to as ""The King"" in many episodes, he spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie, but their relationship comes to an end when Laurie (Eric's older sister) reveals their affairs to Jackie. He fathers a baby girl named Betsy from a librarian named Brooke during the seventh season. He becomes a police officer but gets kicked off the force because he does just about everything wrong. He gets a job as a security guard at a Playboy Club in Chicago and leaves the series during the eighth and final season. Kelso, along with Eric, returns for the series finale.  Danny Masterson as Steven Hyde: Eric's best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, the Formans allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother, making him a foster brother to Eric. Hyde has a witty, blunt and sarcastic sense of humor and a rebellious personality. He is also smart and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, in the final season he marries an exotic dancer named Samantha. Hyde later discovers Samantha was married to another man when she married him. As Donna points out in ""My Fairy King"", that means Hyde and Samantha are not legally married. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by Tim Reid), a wealthy black businessman (making Hyde, who was presumed white, biracial). Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first an office worker, then a manager and later the owner of the Point Place record store. He also previously worked for Leo in a Photo Hut earlier in the series.  Laura Prepon as Donna Pinciotti: Eric's longtime girlfriend (and briefly fiancée). Donna is tall, intelligent, good-looking. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends. Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Casey, Michael's brother and Randy during the final season and quickly ends it. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show's finale.  Wilmer Valderrama as Fez: The horny foreign exchange student of the group whose hormones are usually out of control. His country of origin is never named. He enjoys eating candy, drinking beer and looking at pornography. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes a ladies' man. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple.  Josh Meyers as Randy Pearson (season 8): Hyde's employee at the record store. He is introduced in the final season. Randy appears laid back, gentle, polite and a ladies' man, although many of his flaws surface later, encompassing parts of the departed Kelso and Eric's personalities and other attributes. Tall (like Kelso), he tends to spout witty one-liners (like Eric), and makes silly voices. He forms a friendship with Red after showing Red how good he is at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna and Kelso embrace him as a new member of their group, Fez initially does not, but soon warms up to him. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, but she later breaks up with him. The two end on good terms and remain friends. He makes a brief appearance in the series finale.  Adults [ edit ]  Debra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman: Red's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.  Kurtwood Smith as Red Forman: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. A conservative Navy combat veteran, he served in World War II and the Korean War. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing.  Lisa Robin Kelly (seasons 2–3; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and Christina Moore (recurring season 6) as Laurie Forman : Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often mock her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, ""bottomless dancing is legal"".  : Eric's attractive but promiscuous, manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often mock her promiscuity.

In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series again during season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, ""bottomless dancing is legal"". Tanya Roberts as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1–3; special guest appearance seasons 6–7): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is the sexy neighborhood mom about whom Eric and his male friends fantasized when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after leaving Bob and moving to California. She returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a limited recurring role. She is temporarily replaced in Bob's heart by the aggressive, assertive Joanne (played by Mo Gaffney), tall like Midge but not as pretty. She and Bob meet in a supermarket. Red and Joanne almost immediately take a mutual dislike to each other.  Don Stark as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a veteran of foreign wars. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner.  Tommy Chong as Leo (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2–3 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four, but is later referenced in season five's ""The Battle of Evermore"" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.

The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address streaking, the sexual revolution, the Equal Rights Amendment, the 1973 oil crisis, and the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of the first Star Wars movie, which premiered in May 1977.  Throughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These, however, were largely abandoned after season 2, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, showing ""December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m."" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the registration tags on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. The final episode's closing credits showed an ""80"" year tag.  The show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, ""Grandma's Dead"", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach ""one"" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.  The show's unexpected longevity (it was the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation) combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series timeline sped up and slowed down with more rapidity near the series' climax, the timeline necessitated that several major events depicted as having occurred months apart would have in fact happened within weeks or even days of one another.  The timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, M*A*S*H aired for 11 seasons despite the Korean War only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters age faster than normal while other characters age naturally.  Eighth season and series finale [ edit ]  The character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[2] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[2] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an ""innocent character"", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[3] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers, was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[4] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle. Both Eric and Kelso returned for the series' final episode, although Topher Grace was uncredited.  The eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[5] and ""That '70s Finale"" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[6]  Production [ edit ]  Title [ edit ]  The working titles for the show were Teenage Wasteland (named after the lyric from ""Baba O'Riley"" by The Who), The Kids Are Alright (named after another song by The Who), Feelin' All Right, and Reeling in the Years (named after the song by Steely Dan). However, due to the denials of these three songs from the 1970s (including The Who's Pete Townshend's denial of using his two songs for each of the two titles), and Fox Network's decision that Feelin' All Right was not too memorable, co-creator Bonnie Turner suggested that the show should be titled That '70s Show, which ultimately became the official title for the show.[7]  Opening [ edit ]  Theme song [ edit ]  The show usually opens with the theme song, ""In the Street"", written by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell of the band Big Star. The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album #1 Record. In 2000, Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired, an amount he thought ironic, given the show's title.[8]  Big Star's original version of the song was not used on the show. Instead, a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick. Unlike previous versions of the song, Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase ""We're all alright!"" quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song ""Surrender"".[9]  Both versions of the song (Todd Griffin and Cheap Trick) used on the show end with somebody yelling ""Hello, Wisconsin!"" In Griffin's version, Masterson is the one yelling ""Hello, Wisconsin!""[10] while it is unknown who yells it in Cheap Trick's version during the opening. On the soundtrack, That '70s Album (Rockin'), Cheap Trick's lead singer Robin Zander yells ""Hello, Wisconsin!""[11] Alternate holiday versions of the theme song were arranged for Halloween and Christmas specials, using organ music and bells, respectively.  Opening credits [ edit ]  Opening credits for seasons 1–7 showed members of the cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together. At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).  After Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, Mila Kunis ""Hanging Out...;"" Danny Masterson ""Down the Street""). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were Kurtwood Smith and Tommy Chong, with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last ""We're all alright"". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears ""Hello, Wisconsin!"" The final episode omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.  Elements of the show [ edit ]  The 1970s [ edit ]  The show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as sexism, sexual attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking, including teenage drug use. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television remote (""the clicker""), reruns, VCR, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars.[12] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[13]  Beginning with the second season, the show focused less on the sociopolitical aspects of the story. For example, the dynamic of the relationship between Eric and Donna was altered in later seasons to more closely resemble the relationships of other ""power couples"" on teen dramas. Likewise, the first season of the show featured a recurring, more dramatic storyline in which the Formans were in danger of losing their home due to Red's hours being cut back at the auto parts plant where he worked. Storylines in later seasons were generally presented more comically and less dramatically.  The show also featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Betty White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Tom Poston and Jack Riley (The Bob Newhart Show), Pamela Sue Martin (The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries), Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati), Eve Plumb, Barry Williams and Christopher Knight (The Brady Bunch), Tom Bosley and Marion Ross (Happy Days), Monty Hall (Let's Make A Deal), Gavin MacLeod (The Love Boat and The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Don Knotts, Richard Kline and Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company), and Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family). Series recurring cast member Tanya Roberts also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (Charlie's Angels).  Beginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (Season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled ""That '70s Finale"").[14]  Split screens [ edit ]  One device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode ""Who Wants It More?"", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the ""caver"" will be owned by the other.  Dream sequences [ edit ]  The show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as Star Wars, Rocky, and Grease.  The character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode ""Stone Cold Crazy"", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in ""Eric's Birthday"" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in ""It's All Over Now"").  In the 100th episode, ""That '70s Musical"", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.  The circle [ edit ]  The circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in Eric's basement. The picture is of the final scene of the series.  In the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the ""drug-induced"" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word ""marijuana"" while in the circle (except in one episode ""Reefer Madness""), often referring to it as ""stuff"" or a ""stash"". In the episode ""Bye-Bye Basement"", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to ""weed""; in ""The Relapse"", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for ""smoking weed and beating up freshmen;"" in ""Ski Trip"" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in ""Eric's Burger Job"", Kelso blames his ""roach clip"" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (""That Wrestling Show"" and ""Hyde Moves In"") Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words ""Cannabis Sativa"" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in ""The Pill"" Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, ""That kid's on dope!"" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.  As the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are ""Class Picture"", ""I'm A Boy"", ""Substitute"", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.  The stupid helmet [ edit ]  The stupid helmet refers to a replica of a Green Bay Packers helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a ""dumbass"", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.  The water tower [ edit ]  In many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local water tower. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.  After Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was ""invincible"". In the ""Water Tower episode"", the gang painted a marijuana leaf on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving the finger. In the episode ""The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)"" Kelso paints Jackie and his names on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss on the tower in the show's finale.  Scene transitions [ edit ]  In the first season, scene transitions (also known as bumpers) consisted of animated smiley buttons[15] or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using Syncro-Vox, usually yelling, in a rock form, ""Yeahhh!"" or something similar (ex. Farrah Fawcett saying ""Yeah!"" or Richard Nixon saying ""Are you ready to rock and roll?"") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of lava lamps with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.  Beginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, lava lamp-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the episode usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.  By the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).  ""Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)"" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.  The Vista Cruiser [ edit ]  Many of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's ""Aztec Gold"" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.  The show's pronunciation of ""Vista Cruiser"", with emphasis on ""Cruiser"" conflicted with the pronunciation of author George Plimpton in the Oldsmobile television advertisement for the 1969 Vista Cruiser, where he pronounced the two words with the emphasis on ""Vista"".[16]  That particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for US$500.[17]  In August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.[18]  Running gags and catchphrases [ edit ]  In one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of catchphrase, ""kicking your ass"". For example, in ""Kitty and Eric's Night Out"", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, ""I swear I'll kick his ass!"" In ""Eric's Hot Cousin"", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, ""And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass"", and, in ""Prank Day"", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone ""horribly, horribly wrong"" Red says, ""Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!"" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.  Some other notable running gags and catchphrases are:  Red's favorite insult is ""dumbass"", the origin of which is revealed in ""Halloween"". Ironically, Eric is the first character to say ""dumbass"" in ""Eric's Burger Job"" (season 1 episode 5). The insult is adopted by the whole gang and even occasionally by Kitty. Red regularly comes up with new choice insults such as ""kettlehead"" (which refers to Kelso).  Fez's country of origin is never revealed. Sometimes, Fez is about to disclose where he is from, or at least hint at it, but something happens to prevent him from doing so, like someone entering the room as seen in ""Stolen Car"", or Fez rambling in ""Love of My Life"". [19]  Fez's real name was also never revealed. Even Fez stood for FES, Foreign Exchange Student. [20] [21] Red often calls Fez by some exotic foreign name when he is speaking directly to him.  Red often calls Fez by some exotic foreign name when he is speaking directly to him. Someone, usually Kelso, falls off the Water Tower. [22]  The word ""burn"", a term used by a character after something bad or offensive happens at another character's expense, although it is more often used by Kelso. According to Kelso in ""Dine and Dash"", a good burn consists of two elements: ""You didn't see it coming; parts of it really hurt.""  Hyde would usually give Kelso a punch in the arm for either his stupidity or bad behavior.  Kelso yells ""Ow, my eye!"" when Hyde rough-houses with him. For example, in the episode ""Class Picture"", a series of flashbacks feature Hyde beating up Kelso. While the two are out of the immediate sight of the audience, Kelso yells, ""Ow, my eye!"" and the scene cuts to the next flashback. This gag is repeated several times throughout the series, although the only time Kelso appears with an injured eye is in ""Jackie's Cheese Squeeze"" after he was punched by Todd, Jackie's manager. On that occasion, Kelso did not yell, ""Ow, my eye!"" [23]  Fez uses the phrase ""Good day"", followed by another cast member saying, ""But Fez..."" and Fez immediately interrupts with an exclamatory, ""I said good day!"" In some instances, the words vary, but the interaction is the same.  Eric has a never-ending streak of quoting Star Wars . In several episodes, he relates things to Star Wars , or quotes the film. In times of trouble, he brings a toy light saber and his going-away present from Donna was her dressing up as Princess Leia.  . In several episodes, he relates things to , or quotes the film. In times of trouble, he brings a toy light saber and his going-away present from Donna was her dressing up as Princess Leia. Everyone who calls Eric's action figures ""dolls"" is always loudly corrected by Eric: ""They're action figures!""  Kitty often uses alcohol or her use is mentioned, particularly after she starts menopause during the fifth season.  Fez's sex life or usually lack thereof. Often Fez accidentally reveals some perverse behavior he performed, like hiding in Donna's room. [24]  The best thing to do or the best solution can be found by ""The Circle"". [25]  Eric's attempted ""secret"" money stash locations are known by everyone. [26] [27]  Guest stars from 1970s sitcoms would often have an inside joke referring to their earlier series.  Kitty will often laugh in situations she finds awkward.  British remake [ edit ]  In 1999, the show was remade by the ITV network in the United Kingdom as Days Like These using almost verbatim scripts with minor changes to cultural references.[28]  Merchandise [ edit ]  Home media [ edit ]  That '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment at an increment of two seasons per year between 2004 and 2008 and a complete series release on October 14, 2008.

AllMusic gave both albums 3 out of 5 stars in their reviews.[30][31]  Reception [ edit ]  American ratings [ edit ]  Over the course of its run, the series was a consistent performer for Fox, becoming one of their flagship shows. Its eight seasons, consisting of 200 episodes, made it Fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom ever behind Married... with Children, though That '70s Show did not have the same ratings success.

Lindsay Lohan says she was “racially profiled” at London’s Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.  The Mean Girls actress, 30, said she was stopped by a woman who asked her to take her headscarf off. “She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘But please take off your headscarf,'” Lohan told U.K. television show Good Morning Britain. She added: “And I did, it’s okay. But what scared me was in that moment — how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”  Lohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds “solace” studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn’t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience “really jarring.” She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: “I’m from New York — I’m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.”  When Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was “out of respect” for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. “I was… leaving Turkey and… when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women — that’s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,” she said.  When Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. “I don’t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,” she said. “But at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what’s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they’re capable — or not capable — of.” However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away “or deleted.” Watch the clip below:	1
"Image Source: Getty / ullstein bild Dtl.  The second season of Netflix's hit series The Crown shed lots of light on Queen Elizabeth II's hapless younger sister, Princess Margaret. From her dramatic love life and nude photo scandal to her penchant for drinking and smoking, it's been made abundantly clear what most royal family aficionados knew all along: Margaret was never meant to blend in. She was always going to stand out.  Margaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; much like Prince Harry and Princess Charlotte after her, she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister — after all, if you don't bear the direct responsibility of one day taking the throne, you have less pressure put on you to be perfect. Margaret was only 22 when her sister became queen, and while her duties mostly consisted of representing the family on royal tours of Jamaica, Japan, Australia, and the US, she also had a vested interest in welfare charities, music, and the ballet.  After failed engagements, one divorce, two children, and a handful of extramarital affairs, Princess Margaret's royal reputation wasn't one to be desired. Throughout her later life, her health began to severely decline and the glamorous jet-set lifestyle she was known for faded away; a cigarette smoker since 15, Margaret had part of her left lung removed in 1985 (an operation similar to the one her father, King George VI, underwent three decades earlier) — and though she was able to kick the habit some years later, she continued to drink heavily. The '90s brought a bout with pneumonia, a mild stroke, and a bathroom incident — during which her feet were burned from scalding-hot bathwater — that resulted in loss of mobility to her feet.  Image Source: Getty / Tim Graham  By the early 2000s, Margaret needed help walking (and would sometimes use a wheelchair), and in January and March 2001, she suffered more strokes that inhibited her vision and paralyzed her left side. By the end of that year, Margaret would make only two official public appearances; one in August for the 101st birthday party of the Queen Mother and one in December to celebrate her aunt Princess Alice's 100th birthday.  Margaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister.  ADVERTISEMENT  On Feb. 9, 2002, Princess Margaret died at the King Edward VII Hospital in London after suffering another stroke. She was 71. Her sister, Queen Elizabeth II, announced the news ""with great sadness"" in a statement from Buckingham Palace. A private service for family and friends was held six days later, on the 50th anniversary of her beloved father's own funeral. Margaret was cremated — a rarity for royals — and her ashes were placed in the tomb with her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother (her mother died just seven weeks after Margaret), at Windsor Castle. In April 2002, a state memorial service was held for Margaret at Westminster Abbey. And like the unconventional badass that she was, Margaret even wrote her own epitaph, which was carved on a memorial stone.  We thank thee Lord who by thy spirit doth our faith restore  When we with worldly things commune & prayerless close our door  We lose our precious gift divine to worship and adore  Then thou our Saviour, fill our hearts to love thee evermore  As far as her legacy goes, royal biographers have posited that Margaret paved the way for future members of the family to come out on the other side after divorce. Without her public split from Earl of Snowdon in 1978 — and bearing the brunt of bad press and criticism that came with it — it may not have been as easy for her niece, Princess Anne, and nephews Charles and Andrew to go through with their own divorces (from Captain Mark Phillips, Princess Diana, and Sarah, Duchess of York, respectively)."	0
Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

Tyler Hoechlin returning as Superman for crossover, Lois Lane to appear  DC has announced that Tyler Hoechlin (Teen Wolf, Supergirl) will be returning to The CW as Superman in this year’s annual Arrowverse superhero crossover event. The Man of Steel will also be joined by Lois Lane, marking the power couple’s DCTV crossover debut.  Hoechlin made his first appearance as Clark Kent in season two of Supergirl as Kara Danvers legendary cousin. After being featured in four episodes of the series, Hoechlin will put back on his cape as we wait to see who will be cast to play Lois Lane.  The CW recently set the dates for the annual crossover, with this year’s storyline heading to Gotham City, a place previously off-limits to The CW. The crossover will start with The Flash on Sunday, December 9. Arrow will continue the story on Monday, December 10, before it all comes to an end in Supergirl on Tuesday, December 11. DC’s Legends of Tomorrow is sitting out of this year’s event, and Black Lightning has yet to establish any firm links with the Arrowverse.  Season 3 saw Supergirl stop Reign and the other Worldkillers’ threat to humanity and our planet, and in the process, Kara was shocked to find her mother Alura alive and living in a salvaged Argo City that survived the destruction of Krypton. Reconnecting with her past caused Kara to realize that her true home is now here on Earth, where big changes are taking place for her and all of her friends in National City – and also, it appears, for a doppelganger in Russia! Season four promises to be full of surprises, action, adventure and lots of big revelations for Supergirl, Alex, James, J’onn, Lena and Brainy.  Supergirl stars Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers/Supergirl, Mehcad Brooks as James Olsen, Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers, Jeremy Jordan as Winslow ‘Winn’ Schott, Katie McGrath as Lena Luthor, Jess Rath as Brainiac 5, and David Harewood as Hank Henshaw/J’onn J’onnz. New to the cast for the fourth season is Sam Witwer as hero Agent Liberty.  Based on the DC characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the series is executive produced by Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller. Supergirl is produced by Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.  Supergirl season four will premiere on The CW on its new night, Sunday, October 14, at 8:00 p.m.  Are you excited for Hoechlin to return as Superman? Who do you want to see play Lois Lane?

"If you're at all familiar with the supermodel-heavy, glitter-coated televised spectacular that is the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show , you've heard of the Fantasy Bra: a one-of-a-kind undergarment handmade in collaboration with a jeweler to the exact measurements of one of the Angels that closes out the program (and is valued at a few million dollars). This year the honor of walking the sparkly runway in the very expensive bejeweled creation will go to Lais Ribeiro , the 27-year-old Brazilian model who got her Angel wings in 2015, but has been in the Victoria's Secret family since 2010. And though they're usually made aware of the appointment months before the show, Ribeiro admits that Victoria's Secret cut it a little close this year: She didn't find out until her fitting, which took place in August. (The show tapes in Shanghai on November 21.) So how did the lingerie giant pull off the surprise?  ""[Victoria's Secret] sent the new collection to me—I tried [the bra], and I had to take pictures and polaroids,"" Ribeiro explains to Glamour. ""They said, ‘Oh no, it’s just for a segment on the show.’ I was like, 'Sure!'"" Imagine her surprise when she's trying on looks for the show, and someone wheels in the Fantasy Bra for her to see. Luckily, we don't have to get too creative with the details, because Victoria's Secret got it all on tape.  ""It was a mix of emotions inside of me,"" the model says of what was going through her head when she realized what was going on. ""I was so happy, thankful, honored to be chosen. Hard work pays off—that’s all I thought about. Like, wow, I’ve been working with the brand for seven years, but we never know."" As soon as she wrapped filming for the televised program (you already have a calendar alert set up for the 28th, when it airs on CBS, right?), Ribeiro got into the car to share the news with her family back in Brazil. Over FaceTime, she says, ""I put everybody in the room and I was like, ‘I have something to tell you guys’—they thought I was pregnant, but I was like, ‘No…’ and then they started to scream and cry. My sister dropped the phone.”  Though she notes that her family was number one on the list of people she wanted to share the news with, she was just as psyched to show her fellow Angels. Adriana Lima was a particularly emotional one, because she's acted as a sort of role model for Ribeiro within Victoria's Secret. ""I remember that I was just crying so much [at the fitting], and we [went] back to the room to change, and Adriana was [there]—she said, ‘Hey,’ and saw [the Fantasy Bra] and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, so well-deserved.’"" For people who look up to the Angels, ""Adriana Lima is, like, the strongest because she’s a mother, she’s a sexy girl, she has such a strong personality—but at the same time, she’s so open to teach us and welcome us to where she’s been living for so long,"" Ribeiro says. ""That’s what’s amazing about her.""  Pinterest PHOTO: Gary Gershoff  Ribeiro has said how, growing up Brazil, she didn't know much about the modeling world or Victoria's Secret—however, she vividly remembers the first time she learned about the Fantasy Bra: when fellow Brazilian Gisele Bündchen wore the $12.5 million ""Sexy Splendor Fantasy Bra"" in 2005. ""She’s just killing it; it’s so amazing,"" she recalls. ""And she’s from Brazil. I was just like, 'It’s so amazing to be from a country where we have so many top models and we are proud of what we do.' When you’re from the same country, you’re cheering for [each other]. That was my first and favorite—until now.”  When she hits the catwalk in Shanghai, all Ribeiro hopes for is that the image of her in the ""Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra"" feels true to her. “I hope I can show my personality…. I try to be calm and do me,"" she says. That's not as easy as it sounds when you're on that mega-runway in your lingerie, with heavy wings flapping behind you, Ribeiro assures: ""You’re walking and you feel like you’re bouncing""—but at the same time you're trying to have that not read on your face because you know you have cameras pointed at you from every angle. Looking for familiar faces in the audience doesn't help calm her nerves, either. ""When I [see] them, I just want to cry. It’s kind of like, ‘OK, they’re there, they’re proud of me, but I can’t control my emotions,’ because I’m very emotional,"" she admits. When the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show went to London, she actually couldn't keep it together: ""I saw my sister, and I just started to cry and everyone was like, ‘What is happening?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know!’""  Loading View on Instagram  The ""Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra"" will have its moment to shine on the 2017 Victoria's Secret runway later this month, but Ribeiro has gotten a few chances to try the style on for size since she got the news. So the million-dollar—or rather, two-million-dollar question is: What does the Fantasy Bra feel like? According to Ribeiro, ""It feels amazing, I have to say—it feels very powerful. I was just feeling myself when I was wearing it.""  Related Stories:  And the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Fantasy Bra Goes To…  The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Finally Cast Its Models!

Not all of Caitlyn Jenner‘s kids are dealing with her transition gracefully.  While the world has been on an inspiration high since Jenner’s AMAZING speech at the July 15 ESPYS, Kylie Jenner is reportedly not as thrilled. According to a source, Kylie has felt more “alone” than ever following Cait’s change.  [ Related: Surprise! Almost All Of The Kardashian & Jenner Kids Came Out To Support Caitlyn At The ESPYS! ]  A source explained:  “Kylie has not been taking this whole thing well at all and cannot come to terms with the fact that her father is now Caitlyn.”  Hmm. Considering the youngest Jenner didn’t show up to a recent Father’s Day event, we’re not surprised to learn she’s feeling this way.  The insider added:  “Caitlyn has been getting more attention than anyone in the family and perhaps that is part of what bothers Kylie. But also she feels incredibly alone lately and is barely coping. She used to be daddy’s girl but ever since her dad transitioned, Caitlyn does not seem to have the same time for Kylie that Bruce once did. It bothers her a lot and last night while everyone in the family was crying tears of joy, her tears were of sorrow.”  We can understand why the 17-year-old is feeling left out — the 65-year-old is more in demand than ever! Long gone are the days that the Olympian was chauffeuring Kylie and Kendall Jenner around Calabasas!  We just hope Kyles will eventually come around to Caitlyn…we know there’s a lot of love there. Hang in there, you guys!  [Image via E!.]	1

He’s the king of her heart! Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, enjoyed a dinner date in London on Wednesday, August 22.  The low-key couple stepped out at Hawksmoor, a steak restaurant in the Covent Garden district of the U.K. capital. They held hands as they walked down the street to the award-winning eatery.  The 10-time Grammy winner, 28, looked stunning in an emerald-green off-the-shoulder maxidress. She coordinated her black leather clutch with a matching belt and sandals. Her hair was styled in a loose updo. The Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk star, 27, opted for a more casual look with a blue long-sleeved henley, dark jeans and sneakers.  Swift and Alwyn’s relationship first made headlines in May 2017, though she hinted on her album Reputation that it began around late 2016. Neither have spoken publicly about their romance.  “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” a source previously told Us Weekly exclusively of the songstress, who in the past made headlines for flaunting her romances. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”  The British actor has joined the pop superstar on several dates of her ongoing Reputation stadium tour, which kicked off in May and concludes in November. “He’s very supportive of her career and wants to be there every step of the way,” the source told Us.  Swift revealed on Reputation that she met Alwyn at the Met Gala in May 2016 while she was dating Calvin Harris, from whom she split the following month before briefly moving on to Tom Hiddleston. Her other famous exes include Joe Jonas, John Mayer and Harry Styles.  For the latest celebrity news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast “In Case You Missed Us” below!

"In the absence of one Donald Trump , who hosted a rally for himself in Michigan in lieu of attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner Saturday night, the MC and comedian Michelle Wolf declined to, as they say, take any prisoners. “Like a porn star says when she’s about to have sex with Trump, let’s get this over with,” Wolf said, opening her remarks. It was the president’s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents’ Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN’s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981—then recovering from an attempted assassination.)  Among the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents’ Dinner—for, it seems, they weren’t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally—as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe ’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast—but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf’s jokes about Trump’s wealth (“Mr. President, I don’t think you’re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you’re doing fine”) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.  Sanders was reportedly seated in Wolf’s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: “I loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid’s Tale ,” Wolf said to her. “I’m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what’s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.”  The New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders’s seeming gameness for taking the criticism—“That @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,” she wrote on Twitter—a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents’ Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf’s speech), said, “Washington is so thin-skinned .” (She would know .) Celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf’s performance—though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.  But there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf's own, in response to Sean Spicer's tweet that ""Tonight's #WHCD was a disgrace."" ""Thank you!"" she responded.  Also, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn’t have water."	1
Kim Kardashian West said she wants to give her daughter “a normal life” as the pair posed in a new photoshoot inspired by the style of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.  The reality TV star said she was “very conscious” of her daughter’s mixed-race heritage after appearing with North, her daughter with rapper Kanye West, in the pictures for Interview Magazine.  The images were taken by photographer Steven Klein. It is the first time four-year-old North has appeared on the cover of a major magazine.  Kardashian, whose family have roots in Armenia, said: “Kanye always has his family around and people who look like my daughter — that’s important to me.  “She’s obsessed with her curly hair, and if she finds someone who has the same hair, she runs to them and is like, ‘You have curly hair like me?’ And we get to talk about it.  “We also talk about it with my niece Penelope, because she and North look really different, but they’re best friends and they’re together all the time.”  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said the family had “strict rules” about how much of the children’s lives are included in the reality show that made their name.  She said: “Some seasons they’re on a little bit, just to show a bit of personality, although there are never storylines about them. But then there’s social media, on which I’ve always been really open. When I’m out and people call North’s name, that’s when it’s weird for me. She lives such a normal life, believe it or not, at home.”  She shared the images on her Instagram page captioning it: “Interview Magazine September cover!!! This photo shoot I will cherish forever as such an amazing memory with my daughter, working with the most incredible team.”  Kardashian-West said the photographs were a “homage to the iconic Jackie Kennedy”.  But she was criticised on social media, with some people saying the pictures were an insult to the memory of the the former First Lady.  One person tweeted: “This is a disgrace, You are no Jackie O,” while another said: “Jackie O turning over in her damn grave right now.”  Some twitter users also wanted to know why Kardashian’s skin colour appeared to have been darkened to match that of her daughter.  “Why did they darken her skin to try and make her look black?” one asked.	0

California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.	1
"Mila Kunis gushes over husband Ashton Kutcher: 'I got a man that has got a lot of patience'  The 34-year-old actress has been married to Ashton Kutcher - with whom she has three-year-old daughter Wyatt and 16-month-old son Dimitri - since 2015, and has heaped the praise on her spouse, saying she is “lucky” to have found him.  Speaking to E! News, she said: ""I have the world's greatest husband. I swear, I got very lucky, man. I got a man that has got a lot of patience and is incredibly supportive of our family.""  Despite only marrying three years ago, Mila and 40-year-old Ashton have known each other since the late 90s, when they starred together on ‘That 70s Show’.  Ashton Kutcher and wife Mila Kunis have become parents for the second time (AP)  They began dating in 2012, three years before tying the knot, when ‘Jobs’ actor Ashton was undergoing a divorce from first wife Demi Moore, whom he married in 2005.  Mila’s comments come after she previously gushed over her brood, saying she and Ashton are “grateful” to have two tots of their own, as they were desperate to start a family.  She said in November: ""I have an 11-month-old and a three-year-old - I have tiny little humans. Ashton and I wanted kids so bad; we were so ready to be parents.  ""We were able to have this little family the way we wanted, and I'm so grateful for it and it's the one thing that I can't control.  (L-R) Actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are not shy of public displays of affection  ""That's where my vulnerability is. My job, it comes and goes. You don't get a job, you get a job, you don't get a job. Your kids, you just want one thing.”  Previously, the ‘Black Swan’ star also credited Ashton with helping her learn about the “business side” of their shared profession.  She said: ""Honestly, full disclosure, when I started dating Ashton, I was like, 'I don't want to know [about the] business side, it makes me so uncomfortable.' And he said, 'Right, stop, get on the call.'  ""And then I started educating myself, getting the language right. I would ask him questions, Googled lots of things, and now I know what everybody's doing, I know what I can do, I know what I can ask for. I am way more involved than I was five years ago.

The annual Pirelli Calendar always features an all-star lineup of celebs. In 2016, Serena Williams, Yoko Ono, Patti Smith and Amy Schumer modeled for spread. In 2017, actresses Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman, Robin Wright and Nicole Kidman went au naturel for their shoot. And in 2018, Alice in Wonderland was remade with an all-black cast that included Lupita Nyong’o, Naomi Campbell, RuPaul, Sean “Puff Daddy’” Combs among others. So what’s in store for 2019? We have all the info on the newest calendar (and it’s buzzy stars!), below.  The 2019 calendar lineup features model Gigi Hadid with designer Alexander Wang, Dirty John actress Julia Garner, American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Misty Copeland with American Ballet Theatre dancer Calvin Royal III and French actress and model Laetitia Casta.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 46th edition of the calendar was shot by Albert Watson and meant to look like film stills. “Each character has a part to play in the 2019 Pirelli Calendar,” Watson explained. “In some cases, the role was close to what the actress does for a living, but here they were certainly all acting a part. Not themselves. And that’s what I wanted.”  The theme of the collection is titled “dreams” because each woman is focused on their future in the stills. “The basic idea behind the whole project is that of telling a story in four ‘little movies,'” Watson said.  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  For Hadid’s part, she played a woman who just broke up with her companion (don’t worry — IRL she’s still with Zayn Malik).  “She has a confidant, not a boyfriend, played by the designer Alexander Wang,” said Watson. “He is helping her get over this difficult time. I think there’s a degree of angst in these images. With Gigi Hadid’s character, I wanted to convey the sense of a woman thinking about her future, but also showing her in a situation of loneliness.” Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  RELATED VIDEO: Queer Eyes’ Jonathan Van Ness Says Gigi Hadid ‘Is Very Talented with Her Hands’ — And Loves to Bake!  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  Copeland and ballet dancer Calvin Royal III play dancers who are dreaming of performing in Paris and she showed off a few of her professional moves in the photos. “She is looking to the future and has ambitions,” said Watson. “Trying to be successful is her driving force.”  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  For Casta, she portrayed an artist “dreaming of success.”  “What’s interesting is that Laetitia told me that, in her spare time, she really does do a lot of sculpting and creates artwork,” said Watson. “This worked out very well and helped her get into character.”  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  Garner played the role of a “botanical photographer who dreams of putting on successful exhibitions.” And Watson remarked that Garner got “straight into character” during their time on set.	0
Baby on the way! Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm.  The former WWE wrester, 38, and the businessman, 43, secretly tied the knot in March 2014. They welcomed their first child, daughter Ava Grace, now 3, that August.  Three months after giving birth to their daughter, Keibler, who dated actor George Clooney from 2011 to 2013, revealed she never thought about marriage or parenthood until she started a relationship with her now-husband.  “Life can be unpredictable. You feel one way, and then … boom!” Keibler wrote on her lifestyle blog in December 2014. “You need to entirely change your perspective. That is certainly what happened to me this past year. Until I started dating Jared, the idea of being married and having a family was never on my radar. I was just hoping that the right love would find me.”  “But after a serendipitous reconnection with Jared, a friend who turned out to be my soulmate, we created a family together almost instantly,” she continued. “Talk about a serious change in my reality! This year and the holiday season especially has me feeling so nostalgic about family — my family, my new family, and of course, the newest addition to our family. Ava has graced us with such joy, such light and such love–we never saw it coming. She is our special little lady, and I couldn’t be more thankful for how she has opened my heart.”  The Dancing With the Stars season 2 alum has maintained a low profile since becoming a mother. In addition to shutting down her blog, Keibler has not updated her Instagram account since September 2015. The last post she shared on the social media platform was of herself reading a book titled “What Does It Mean to Be Kind?” to Ava.  Clooney, for his part, also started a family after his split from Keibler. The Oscar winner, 57, welcomed twins Alexander and Ella in June 2017 with his wife, Amal Clooney, whom he wed in September 2014.

"Christina El Moussa, 34, and her boyfriend Doug Spedding, 55, have officially broken up. The Flip or Flop star officially ended her relationship with the businessman after he reportedly checked into an in-patient rehabilitation center for addiction issues, according to an In Touch exclusive posted Wednesday. Multiple media outlets also confirmed the news.  ""Doug has had a huge history of drug and alcohol abuse, and Christina was warned when they first started dating,"" a source told E! News.

Margot Tenenbaum, now 21 weeks pregnant. (Photograph by Katherine Wolkoff)  Manhattan, of course, has long been proudly gaunt, inhabited as it is by legions of celebrities, socialites, fashionistas, and those who would be them (remember Edith Wharton’s ethereal creatures, Lily Bart of the long, light step and the slender pink nails? Slender nails?). Only in the past few years, however, have the bump, the basketball, and the belly on two sticks entered the local lexicon. Blooming stars now strut the red carpet at the Oscars and pregnant supermodels flaunt their exposed bellies, while Us Weekly, People, and the Star intrepidly report on who has stayed admirably attenuated (Gwyneth Paltrow, Sarah Jessica Parker) and who has not (Debra Messing, Kate Hudson). In late spring, the hot gossip swirled around paparazzi shots of Paltrow emerging smilingly (triumphantly?) svelte from a London hospital. The conspiracy theory was that she hid out in the hospital for a few weeks after giving birththere’s just no way she could’ve lost so much weight so quickly. The pregnant-celeb watch is about to reach a new peak this fall, as Julia Roberts waddlesshe’s having twins; she can’t help ittoward a January due date. Toss into this roiling mix the Atkins and South Beach dietsthe latest devotionals in New York’s Church of Divine Diminishmentand you’ve got a freshly minted group neurosis. You’ve also got an unnerving question: Are women starving their babies by starving themselves?  W ay back when, in the late fifties, a woman as tortured as Sylvia Plath could be at her sunniest when she was cow-heavy and floral. Today, the prevailing attitude toward the extra flesh of maternity verges on disgust. A sampling of what women tell me they do not want to be while pregnant: a fat slob, a huge blob, sloppy, horrible like Kate Hudson, fucking gross. Tenenbaum’s language is less harsh (mushy is her preferred pejorative), but she has the same fear of becoming almost offensive, of not measuring up. She keeps worrying, she says, about an upcoming vacation with her husband’s family. There’s no way she wants to expose her girth in a bathing suit, but then she wonders if they’ll think she’s ashamed of her body if she swims in shorts and a shirt. And maybe I am ashamed, she says.  Berger sympathizes. The last time I got weighed [at the OB’s], I was really pleased the nurse just wrote the number in my chart and didn’t say it out loud, because it was so . . . If you knew how much I weighed, you’d be like, Oh, my God!’   In conversations with several dozen more pregnant women and new mothers, I was repeatedly struck by how fixated they are on the new pregnancy ideal, how much they lap up the praise if they achieve it, how anxious they are if they don’t. It’s a jungle out there, and only the scrawniest survive.  Beth Dorfman, a second-trimester periodontist, was so concerned about blowing up, and about eating healthy in general, that she consulted nutritionist Tanya Zuckerbrot early in her pregnancy (Zuckerbrot says she’s seen a significant increase in the number of women who come to her for weight-related reasons). I remember shopping with my mother and I thought, These random people walking past me on the street, I wonder if they think Hmm, that girl might be pregnant, or That girl might just have eaten seventeen cupcakes an hour ago, ’  Dorfman says.  Zuckerbrot advised Dorfman to eat more protein and fiber (pregnant women can go Atkins, by the way, as long as they eat some carbs) and turned her onto the miracle that is Scandinavian fiber crisps. They’re like sixteen calories a cracker, Dorfman says. They’re not the tastiesta nice bagel or bread would taste betterbut they satisfy some of the craving and fill me up. Dorfman promptly began eating three of the Scandinavian crisps topped with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast. Even her peanut butter is diet, she says. It’s not Skippy Reduced Fat; it’s even lower fat than that, like 2.5 grams per serving. All the calorie counting is a necessary evil, says Dorfman. When you’re pregnant, you’re only supposed to eat 300 more calories per day, she says, citing a common recommendation. That’s not much. One of those Dannon Light ’n Fit yogurts, that’s 100 calories right there.  When it comes to exercise, so many women rhapsodized to me about spotting a sublimely trim pregnant woman exercising her butt off at the local Equinox that I began to wonder whether clever health-club marketers were fitting trainers with fat pads. Meredith Paley, a vice-president at Kenneth Cole whose daughter, Ava, was born in July, is one of those who attracted gawkers. Her pregnancy-workout schedule: spinning on Tuesdays, body sculpting Wednesdays, one or two other random gym visits a week, and five-mile Central Park runs on Wednesdays, Fridays, and both weekend days. Because Paley knows that doctors recommend that pregnant women keep their heart rates under 140 beats per minute (to keep sufficient oxygen flowing to the baby), she says she always wore a monitor and walked when the number got close. A serious runner, Paley volunteers several times that intense exercise is natural for her, what makes her feel good. Still, she says, I’m the first to admit that I didn’t see pregnancy as an excuse to sit on my ass and let the pounds come.  One maternity researcher says she ﬁnds her subjects’ weight-restrictive behaviors unnerving. The pregnancy and delivery is all about them. If you can’t invest in your baby by gaining weight, I think it’s a harbinger for lack of investment in the child.  Dorfman, also an avid exerciser, is frustrated by the heart-rate cutoff. If the doctor says 140, I want to go to 137that’s just the type of person I am. I’m not going to jeopardize the health of my child, but I’m on the treadmill like, God, I’m not even sweating. I feel like it’s not doing anything.  This kind of superfit patient has become increasingly common, says Upper East Side obstetrician Shari Brasner, during the ten years she’s been in practice. She mentions a third-trimester patient who blew by her running in the park recently (It was unbelievable), and one who, after developing a painful nerve cluster in her foot, cut a hole in her sneaker rather than step off the treadmill. The doctor says it’s not hard to spot which patients are tormented by their expansion: They take ten minutes to remove every last bit of clothing, down to the rubber band on their ponytail, before getting on the scale.  Julie Tupler disavows the idea that women should be skinny or diet during pregnancy, but there’s no denying that her classes attract those who are serious about flab. You’re not supposed to gain ten pounds in the first trimester, says Patty Surak, who was eight months along, but I did. On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Surak and five other very pregnant women were assembled for a Tupler session, outfitted in oversize T-shirts and black exercise pants. One staple of Tupler’s class is a sort of pregnancy-safe sit-up. The group’s homework is 500 a day.  What’s the magic word for next week? Tupler asked.  One thousand, the group replied in unison.  You can start doing these again right after the placenta comes out, Tupler said. I had one student who even did it before!  A s is probably obvious by now, it’s not just how much weight women gain but where they gain it. Like Dante’s levels of hell, there’s a hierarchy of bad to worse. Level 1: All extra adipose tissue is smartly confined to the stomach. (That’s the baby’s body, not yours, says mother and academic body watcher Susan Bordo, author of the recently rereleased Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.) Level 2: Your breasts get big, too, but nothing else. (I know a lot of women who get pregnant who are very flat-chested, and it’s like heaven to them, says Tenenbaum, who’s already well endowed and hasn’t felt the thrill, though her husband apparently can’t get enough: He’s like, Your boobs! They’re so big! It’s great!’ ) Level 3: Your butt and thighs puff up, or become rumply (one UrbanBaby mother’s lament). And finally, Level 4: Your face and ankles swell, a fate that befell 34-year-old publicist Katie Pottinger. My entire body widened. My face, I wouldn’t even say it was puffy; I mean, it really blew out. There was a thickening, she says, that happened all over.  The skinny-pregnancy set also lives to be told they’re having a boy. Under the old anti-feminist canard straight out of Grimm’s, girls steal their mother’s looks. I was like a preening peacock when people told me You must be having a boy,’  says Kate Walsh, an associate editor for Metropolitan Home and the new mother of a very female Evelyn. Diana Becker, a soft-spoken 28-year-old legal secretary, got the other end of the deal: You must be having a girl, a neighbor lady informed her. Why? Becker naïvely asked. Because people get fat all over when it’s a girl.	1

Shania Twain has changed her live shows to avoid risking a Lyme disease flare-up.  The Still the One singer hits the road as part of her Now Tour next month (May18) to support her new album, but after being diagnosed with the infectious disease, which can cause nerve damage and paralysis, she can no longer perform without a strict set of guidelines.  “It’s more work for me now vocally because of the Lyme disease effect on the nerves in my larynges, so it’s like an hour and a half of, like, physical exercise,” she explained to E! News. “I take a mini trampoline with me and I’ve got to do a real pre-show show.”  The 52-year-old country icon insists her new concert series is “still sexy” despite the change in her routine behind-the-scenes, revealing she and her crew have crafted shows with “something nobody has seen before.”  Shania is grateful she caught the condition early, because it could have been much worse.  “Lyme disease does affect your life for sure. It’s such a silent, evil thing,” she shared. “A lot of the symptoms you just learn to live with. I was lucky that I caught it early. I did get a lot of damage but I’m not battling with degenerative organ issues, so I feel very fortunate.”  Shania went public with her Lyme disease diagnosis last summer (Jul17) and she is now looking at the illness as a source of empowerment and confidence.  “By the time you’re my age, you have something. Everybody’s got something in some form of their life,” she smiled. “I’m proud of myself on one hand for persevering.”  Shania’s Now Tour kicks off in Tacoma, Washington on 3 May (18).	0
hollywood  Celebrities find out about their Emmys nominations in many unique ways, but it seems like actress Elisabeth Moss found about hers in the most inimitable style    Elisabeth Moss accepts the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for 'The Handmaid's Tale' during the 69th Emmy Awards at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. Pic/AFP  Celebrities find out about their Emmys nominations in many unique ways, but it seems like actress Elisabeth Moss found about hers in the most inimitable style.    The star of 'The Handmaid's Tale', who arrived at the Red Carpet of 2017 Emmy Awards in a custom Prabal Gurung gown, revealed that she got to know about her Emmy nomination courtesy of a shirtless GIF.

The talented singer opened his set with two of his most recognizable tunes, “Pray For Me” and the ultra popular “Starboy.” When he got to “Call Out My Name” in the latter part of his performance, after calling this audience beautiful and expressing his appreciation for them. As soon as he started belting out the lyrics to the emotional tune, it definitely looked like his sweat had a combination of tears to go along with it.

"Ocean's 8 (stylized onscreen as Ocean's Eight) is a 2018 American heist comedy film directed by Gary Ross and written by Ross and Olivia Milch. The film is both a continuation and a spin-off from Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy and features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, and Awkwafina. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala in New York City.  After the release of Ocean's Thirteen in 2007, Soderbergh stated he had no intentions of making a fourth film, citing his desire to have the series ""go out on top"". However, an all-female spin-off was announced in October 2015, with much of the cast signing on by August 2016. Filming took place from October 2016 to March 2017 around New York City.  Ocean's 8 premiered at Alice Tully Hall on June 5, 2018 and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day of the release of Ocean's Thirteen. The film has grossed over $291 million worldwide and received a lukewarm critical response, with praise for the performances of the cast (particularly Bullock, Blanchett, and Hathaway), but criticism for the storyline.[3][4][5]  Plot [ edit ]  Following her release from prison, Debbie Ocean, younger sister of the late Danny Ocean, meets with her former partner-in-crime Lou to convince her to join a heist that she planned while serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie’s who is eager to move out of her mother’s house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer cracker; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family’s suburban home.  Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, from the Met Gala in five weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a dim-witted and snobby actress, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala. After the team manipulates Daphne into choosing Weil as her stylist, Weil and Amita go to Cartier to convince them to let Daphne wear the Toussaint, as well as surreptitiously digitally scan it to later manufacture a cubic zirconia duplicate.  Debbie hunts down Claude Becker, an art dealer who ratted her out to the police when they were discovered for art fraud, which led to her arrest and imprisonment. Debbie manipulates Daphne to invite Becker as her date to the gala. Lou realizes that Debbie is out for revenge on Becker, but Debbie reassures her that everything will be fine.  Weil discovers a flaw in the plan: The Toussaint can only be unclasped using a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier. Nine Ball enlists her younger sister, Veronica, to build a similar magnet in time for the gala. As the gala begins, Daphne consumes soup that Lou spiked, causing her to vomit in the restroom, where Constance takes the necklace. When the necklace is discovered to be missing, the museum is evacuated and searched; Tammy ""finds"" the duplicate necklace in order to end the search. Meanwhile, Amita retrieves the real necklace and begins disassembling it. She retools it into several pieces of jewelry, and gives them to Constance to slip it to each member of the team. One of the real diamonds is planted on Becker.  Soon after the gala, the necklace is identified as fake when returned to Cartier, and John Frazier, an insurance fraud investigator, is called in. Frazier, who has a history with the Ocean family, notices Debbie's presence and suspects her involvement in the heist, but is unable to find any evidence against her solid alibi. Debbie assures Frazier that she does not know where the necklace is, but she may know where part of it is. Dropping her dimwitted persona, Daphne is revealed to have been in on the plan, tipped off by Weil's bad acting, and Debbie and Lou invited her in to keep her from ratting them out. Daphne visits Becker for a romantic evening, where she finds the diamonds planted on him by Debbie during the gala, and sends a picture to Frazier so that he can obtain a warrant to arrest Becker for stealing the necklace. To further frame Becker, Debbie sells pieces of the necklace to actresses disguised as elderly socialites, who in turn sell the jewelry and deposit the money into an account in his name. Becker is arrested.  As the eight celebrate their victory, Daphne asks Debbie and Lou how they each made so much money from the sale of one necklace. Lou reveals that while the gala was being evacuated, Lou and ""The Amazing"" Yen were stealing some of the Crown Jewels on display during the Gala, which makes their cuts higher than expected. Each member of the team goes their separate ways with their money: Amita goes to Paris with a man she met on Tinder; Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a YouTuber; Tammy expands her business in selling stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool bar; Daphne becomes a director; Lou goes on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie returns to Danny’s grave to raise a toast to him with a martini in his honor.  Cast [ edit ]  Additionally, Dakota Fanning appears as Penelope Stern, a celebrity who Kluger is jealous of, and Nathanya Alexander appears as Veronica, Nine Ball's younger sister.[6] Elliott Gould and Shaobo Qin reprise their roles from the previous films as Reuben Tishkoff and ""The Amazing"" Yen, respectively. Matt Damon and Carl Reiner were also set to reprise their respective characters Linus Caldwell and Saul Bloom, but their scenes were cut.[7][8] Marlo Thomas, Dana Ivey, Mary Louise Wilson and Elizabeth Ashley appear as elderly actresses who help the crew shift their stolen gems.[9] Celebrities who cameo as themselves in the film include Anna Wintour, Zayn Malik, Katie Holmes, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Kim Kardashian, Adriana Lima, Desiigner, Kylie Jenner, Alexander Wang, Nina Cuso, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Lily Aldridge, Olivia Munn, Jaime King, Zac Posen, Hailey Baldwin, Derek Blasberg, Sofia Richie, Heidi Klum, Kelly Rohrbach and Lauren Santo Domingo.[10][11]  Production [ edit ]  After the release of Ocean's Thirteen, Steven Soderbergh stated that there would not be an Ocean's Fourteen, noting that George Clooney wanted ""to go out strong"" with the third film.[12] In December 2008, Soderbergh again said that a fourth film in the franchise was unlikely, this time citing the recent death of Bernie Mac, who had appeared in the earlier films.[13] However, a female focused spin-off was in development as of October 2015.[14][15] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling and Elizabeth Banks were later announced to star in the film,[16] though Banks' presence turned out to be a rumor that did not materialize.[17]  In August 2016, Bullock, Blanchett, Bonham Carter and Kaling were confirmed to star, with Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Awkwafina and Sarah Paulson closing deals to fill the cast.[18][19] During production on the film, Dakota Fanning and Damian Lewis were spotted on set, with Lewis's casting being confirmed in December 2016 and Fanning confirming her casting in March 2017. However, Lewis does not appear in the finished film.[20][21][22]  On November 11, 2016, Richard Robichaux was also cast in the film.[23] That same month, Matt Damon stated he would appear in the film, reprising his role from the Ocean's Trilogy;[24][25][26] however, his scene was not included in the finished film. In January 2017, James Corden joined the cast as an insurance broker who begins to grow suspicious of the group.[27] That same month, it was revealed Anna Wintour, Alexander Wang, Zac Posen, Derek Blasberg, Lauren Santo Domingo, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Katie Holmes, Olivia Munn, Hailey Baldwin and Zayn Malik were announced to cameo in the film.[28][29][30][31][32] That same month, Richard Armitage joined the cast of the film.[33]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography on the film began on October 25, 2016, in New York City.[34][35] In March 2017, Blanchett said production had officially been completed.[36]  On May 5, 2017, it was announced that filming would continue on Staten Island at the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, which Broadway Stages was in the process of acquiring after an initial rejection.[37]  Box office [ edit ]  After premiering at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on June 5, 2018,[38] Ocean's 8 was released by Warner Bros. to theaters in North America on June 8.[39][40] In the United States and Canada, Ocean's 8 was released alongside Hotel Artemis and Hereditary, and was projected to gross around $45 million from 4,145 theaters in its opening weekend, although some tracking firms had it debuting with as low as $30 million. Deadline Hollywood noted that it was tracking on-par with the 2016 all-female Ghostbusters reboot (which opened to $46 million), and had more interest from audiences than the likes of fellow female-led comedies The Heat ($39.1 million debut), Spy ($29.1 million) and Girls Trip ($31.2 million).[41] The film made $4 million from Thursday night previews, including $100,000 from additional early screenings Wednesday night, and $15.8 million on its first day (including previews). It went on to debut to $41.6 million, the highest of the franchise, not factoring in inflation; 69% of its audience was female.[42][43] In its second weekend the film made $19 million, finishing second behind newcomer Incredibles 2.[44] In its third weekend the film earned $11.7 million, finishing third behind Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Incredibles 2.[45]  Overseas the film was released in 16 countries alongside the United States and made $12.2 million in its opening weekend. Its largest markets were Australia ($4.7 million), Mexico ($2.6 million) and Brazil ($1.7 million).[46] By its third week of release (where it made $26.9 million), the film had an international total of $70.9 million. Its largest markets were Australia ($10.2 million), South Korea ($8.6 million), the UK ($5.9 million), Mexico ($5.4 million) and Brazil ($4.2 million).[47]  As of August 29, 2018 , Ocean's 8 has grossed $139.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $152.7 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $291.8 million, against a production budget of $70 million.[2]  Critical reception [ edit ]  According to several media outlets, Ocean's 8 received a generally lukewarm response from critics.[48] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 275 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Ocean's 8 isn't quite as smooth as its predecessors, but still has enough cast chemistry and flair to enjoyably lift the price of a ticket from filmgoers up for an undemanding caper.""[49] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[50] According to BBC News, while critical reviews of the film were ""broadly positive"", ""most had some reservations"".[51] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by Ocean's Eleven and Thirteen.[42]  Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast, saying, ""Ocean's 8 is a heist caper that looks gorgeous, keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that's impossible to resist. What more do you want in summer escapism?""[52] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap called the film ""slick, charming and funny,"" though added it never quite kicks into high gear"" and said, ""Cinematographer Eigil Bryld gives the proceedings the high-gloss of a SkyMall catalog, which is appropriate for a movie about robbing a legendary Cartier necklace at fashion's most exclusive event...And between the sheen and the talented performers, Ocean's 8 does eventually coast on froth and good will.""[53]  Variety's Owen Gleiberman said it is ""clever enough to get by"" and wrote ""Ocean's 8 is a casually winning heist movie, no more and no less, but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals, it lingers most...as a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models.""[54] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said, ""Some movies are more about parallel play than actual playground interaction, and despite a screenful of terrifically skillful talents, Ocean's 8 never quite gets its ensemble act together. It's smooth, and far from inept. But it isn't much fun. That's all you want from a certain kind of heist picture, isn't it? Fun?""[55]  Kaling and Blanchett attributed the lukewarm reception to the dominance of male critics and a lack of diversity among mainstream film reviewers. In an interview with Yahoo! Movies, Kaling cited actress Meryl Streep's criticism of Rotten Tomatoes and said, ""There is obviously an audience out there who want to watch things like [Ocean's 8], what I work on, what Sarah [Paulson] works on ... I think white men, critics would enjoy [the movie], would enjoy my work, but often I think there is a critic who will damn it in a way because they don't understand it, because they come at it at a different point of view, and they're so powerful, Rotten Tomatoes."" Several film writers strongly disagreed that the film's reception was dictated by the gender and ethnicity of the critics. Guy Lodge, a chief film critic for Variety, highlighted the fact that several female reviewers, including Emily Yoshida from Vulture and Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek, concurred with the general lukewarm response.[48]  Possible sequel [ edit ]  Sandra Bullock said in an interview that a sequel to Ocean's 8 is possible.[56]"	1

Robert Pattinson is NOT over his ex-fiancee FKA Twigs, and we’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why he still thinks about her.  Ladies, it’s time to take notes! The best way to get back at an ex-boyfriend is to look amazing. FKA Twigs, 30, latest Apple commercial (promoting the HomePod) has her ex-lover Robert Pattison, 31, reminiscing about the good old days. “He loves her very much still and seeing this commercial reminds him of how amazing she is. He sees her talent, he sees her smile, and watching it makes him happy since it such a time warp for him. It takes him back to when they were in a better place. It shows the best of everything about her. Now, will that lead him back to her? Never say never,” a source close to the Twilight star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. So sweet, right?  For those of you who haven’t seen the commercial, Robert isn’t exaggerating. FKA looks absolutely stunning in the ad directed by Spike Jones. In the four-minute clip, the gorgeous singer shows off her enticing dance moves to the tune of “Till It’s Over” by Anderson .Paak. The HomePod transforms her room into a dance floor, and we can’t get enough. No wonder Robert is so smitten. FKA’s commercial also marks her return to the spotlight. Since their breakup in 2017, FKA has kept a pretty low profile, and hasn’t put out any music. So, this is definitely the Friday pick-me-up we didn’t know we needed. Plus, just like Robert, we can’t help but take a trip down memory lane.  Robert and FKA were together for a little two years before deciding to call it quits. We certainly thought they were in it for the long hall as they had plans to get married. Unfortunately, their busy schedules caused them to breakup. Interestingly, right after their split, a source told The Sun, “with so much history between them, though, there are strong feelings there.” And, it’s clear those strong feelings are still alive today. Don’t be surprised if they reunite in the near future! We’d be here for it.	1

The funds will go to help the victims and their families.[10] The British Red Cross reported it received more than £10 million in donations in the 12 hours following the concert.[12] Despite time zone differences, networks from at least 50 countries broadcast the concert live,[13] which was simultaneously streamed live on various platforms, including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.[14]  New York Magazine's Vulture section ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017.[15]  Background [ edit ]  On 22 May 2017, a suicide bombing was carried out at Manchester Arena in Manchester, England, following a concert by Ariana Grande as part of her Dangerous Woman Tour. 22 of the concert-goers and parents who were in the entrance waiting to pick up their children following the show were killed, more than 500 were injured and 116 of those were seriously injured.  A few hours after the bombing, Grande posted on Twitter: ""broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words. [sic]""[16] The tweet briefly became the most-liked tweet in history.[17] Grande subsequently suspended her tour and flew to her mother's home in Boca Raton, Florida.[18][19] On 26 May, she announced that she would host a benefit concert in Manchester for the victims of the attack.[20]  Before main event [ edit ]  Developments and planning [ edit ]  Promotional poster for the concert  Event tickets were made available on 1 June 2017 for £40, and sold with no booking fees.

Whatever the terrorists had hoped to produce in Manchester, it certainly wasn't this party.""[87] She received praise for her ""grace and strength"" in organizing, hosting and performing at the concert.[88][89] Madeline Roth of MTV News wrote that the performance ""bolstered courage among an audience that desperately needed it. ... Returning to the stage was a true act of bravery and resilience"".[90] The City of Manchester named Grande as an honorary citizen of the city following the singer's ""great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit"" and will be the first to be awarded from the city.[91]  Kory Grow in Rolling Stone, wrote ""It felt incredibly safe. As I made my own way to the tram, I wrote in my Apple Notes app, ""Helicopter hovering overhead,"" which to me signified that the fans were being watched over. Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I'd written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they'd read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn't a threat. ""You have to understand, tensions are running high,"" one of the men said with a smile and a handshake, allowing me through the gate. Manchester was secure tonight.""[92] Dee Lockett, in New York Magazine's Vulture section, ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017, noting:  Less than two weeks after the attack, and with only a few days to privately process and mourn, Ariana returned to Manchester with an entire benefit concert she coordinated. ... She called in every favor, pulling in famous friends like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber to show up for the grieving city. After meeting with a parent of one of the victims, Grande said she shifted the tone of the show from somber to celebratory because she understood that it was what her fans needed. ... All night, Ariana performed without breaking, but that was when she had others by her side. ... When it was just her alone with her fans for her finale cover of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", the floodgates opened. In what will likely go down as one of the defining moments of her career, she paused the song, looked out to her audience, which was already sobbing along with her, then resumed the music to nail yet another impossible note.[15]  See also [ edit ]"	1

"Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is a retired American actress who became a member of the British royal family upon her marriage to Prince Harry.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. An outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. She represented international charity organisations in the 2010s. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements as part of the British royal family. She became the Duchess of Sussex on her marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.  Early life and education [ edit ]  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr., from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her ""dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.""[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Procter & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career [ edit ]  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a ""briefcase girl"" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: ""Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.""[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and ""actively re-positioned"" her character from ingenue to ""the show's moral conscience"" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her ""desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings"".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was ""Tig Talk"", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked ""everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years"".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as ""aspirational girl next door"", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life [ edit ]  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and concluded a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55] Markle's subsequent relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello lasted almost two years, ending in May 2016.[56]  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[57][58] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[59] His grandmother Elizabeth II is queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, as well as Head of the Commonwealth.[60] The couple met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] In November, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[62] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[63][64][65] In September 2017, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[66][67]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, where the show is filmed.[68] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[69]  Royal marriage [ edit ]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017 by Clarence House and Kensington Palace.[57][70] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[71] The ring Harry gave Markle was made by Cleave & Company Ltd., and consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[72]  Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[73][74] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[75] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[76] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[76] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[77]  The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[78] They are expecting their first child, who would be seventh in line to the throne, in 2019.[79] The couple will move to Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle's Home Park following the birth, but their office will continue to operate at Kensington Palace.[80][81]  Public life [ edit ]  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[82][83] in connection with World AIDS Day.[84] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[85] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[84] Cardiff,[86] Goldsmiths' Hall,[87] and Edinburgh.[88] On February 28, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, ""Making a Difference Together"" with the prince.[89] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[90] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[91] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12.[92] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23.[93] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[94]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband celebrated the charity work of his father, Prince Charles.[95] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July.[96][97] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[98]  The Duchess takes part in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which includes overseas tours.[99] The first such trip was to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand in October 2018.[100][101] Despite the low support for the monarchy in Australia, the couple were greeted by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of the Duchess's pregnancy hours after arrival was enthusiastically received by the public and media.[101][102]  Fashion and style [ edit ]  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored ""that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up"".[103] In her youth, Markle's ""sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style"" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers ""streamlined dresses"" with ""neutral colors"" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes ""monochromatic and tonal dressing"".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by a wide variety of fashion designers.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for redefining ""modern royal style with every subsequent appearance"".[112] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, the Duchess of Sussex appeared in a Karen Gee dress which resulted in the breakdown of the designer's website.[113]  Charity work [ edit ]  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[115] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[116] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[117][118][119]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[120][121][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[122] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[123] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[120][124] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[125]  In September 2018, the Duchess announced her support for a charity cookbook (for which she wrote the Foreword) titled Together: Our Community Cookbook.[126][127] The book, which is written by women from the Grenfell community, features recipes from around the world.[128] Meghan, who has regularly visited the Hubb Community Kitchen since January 2018,[128] said in a statement: ""Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive.""[126]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World, and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[129][130][131] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[132]  Titles, styles, and arms [ edit ]  Titles and styles [ edit ]  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[133][134] She is styled as ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"",[135] and she is the first person to hold that title.[136]  Arms [ edit ]  Ancestry [ edit ]  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[140] and on her father's side from German,[141] English,[142] and Irish settlers.[143] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[141] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[144][145]  Filmography [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  References [ edit ]"	0

804 SHARES Share TweetAnd once again the mainstream media ends up with egg on its face. This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. “I didn’t have a gun on me but wish I did” pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa — ᏢᏒᎥsᏟᎥᏞᏞᎪ’s ᏉᎥᎬᎳ ™️ (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018“When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.”The witness also added, “I didn’t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.”He said he wished he had a gun. And that’s the way he should feel. And that’s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn’t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. ‘Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! — al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50’s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms… they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that’s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. — Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube “Ad-apocalypse” where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term profits and do anything to reach their goals even by fooling simple-minded people, hiding the truth, manipulating science and everything, putting public mental and physical health at risk, abusing non-human animals, polluting the environment, destroying family values, promoting materialism and sexual degeneration in the name of freedom and turning people into programmed robots!”She goes on to quote Adolf Hitler saying, “Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it and eventually they will believe it.”The rest of her message targets YouTube and censorship. “There is no free speech in the real world and you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system. Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated so that people can hardly see their videos.”February 20, YouTube enacted a new advertising policy that demonetized channels with less than 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time. Though Aghdam’s main English channel had more than 15,000 subscribers, many of her videos appeared to be demonetized.	1
Ryan Seacrest wants the benefit of the doubt.  As allegations of extended sexual harassment by a former coworker came to light, the television personality — and the networks who put him on air — want everyone to know that he’s a good, likable guy.  “Throughout my 25 years in the entertainment industry, the majority of my co-workers have been women, and I’ve endeavored to foster a positive work environment of mutual respect and courtesy, as that’s how I believe it should be,” Seacrest said in a statement when allegations against him surfaced. “I’m distraught that anyone or any situation would call that into question. I’m proud of my workplace reputation, and believe my track record will speak for itself.”  While other men accused of harassment have been held at arm’s length by their employers, Seacrest has had the full force of industry public relations teams behind him.  Before he appears on the new American Idol on Sunday, here’s what’s unfolded so far.  The Ryan Seacrest Harassment Allegations  Seacrest’s allegations came to light on Monday, Feb. 26, after Variety published a detailed account from former stylist, Suzie Hardy, who claimed Seacrest harassed a coworker. Hardy worked at E! between 2007 and 2013.  Seacrest has denied this and his lawyers claim that Hardy asked for $15 million in exchange for her silence.  Hardy accused Seacrest of groping her genitals, grinding against her while wearing only underwear and and with an erection, and slapping her bottom so hard that it left a welt for hours, according to Variety.  An anonymous industry source backed up some of Hardy’s allegations in an interview with Today, and a former E! News employee told Variety that he witnessed the latter two incidents.  An internal investigation, conducted by a third party hired by E!’s parent company NBC Universal, lasted two months and interviewed Seacrest and Hardy among more than two dozen other witnesses, but found “insufficient evidence to substantiate allegations” against him.  The details of the investigation have not been made public. Hardy and her lawyers claim that several key witnesses were not interviewed, though the network disputes that assertion.  How Kelly Ripa and Other Coworkers Responded to Allegations  As Seacrest was quick to point out, a large portion of his various co-hosts and co-workers are women and many have voiced their support for him.  Kelly Ripa went on air to praise her co-host of Live! with Kelly and Ryan.  “You are a privilege to work with and I adore you. Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what a easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day,” she said to Seacrest before hugging him.  ABC’s Scandal star Bellamy Young initially suggested Seacrest shouldn’t host the E! Oscars show, saying it was time “to step aside and let someone of equal talent that is beyond reproach to be in charge.” She retracted her statements promptly the next day and offered an apology, saying she did not have all the information.  “Never has there been a more urgent time to make sure our voices are used for truth, and I failed in that regard Monday night,” she said. “Our word matters. I apologize to Ryan Seacrest.”  Jimmy Kimmel, who hosted the Oscars, also defended Seacrest ahead of the awards show, saying, “We should at the very least afford people the opportunity for truth, what the facts of the story are before hanging them out to dry.”  Was Seacrest Snubbed at the Oscars?  Still, rumors swirled that publicists warned their clients to avoid the TV personality after sexual assault allegations against him resurfaced before the awards show.  Reports of behind-the-scenes scrambling and the institution of a 30-second delay to shield Seacrest from any embarrassment were denied by E! News.  The show did seem to be a flop compared to past years though. Fewer people stopped to talk to Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet last weekend. Ratings did indeed fall.  E!’s Live from the Red Carpet lost 35% of its 2017 audience. And while the entire awards show had its lowest ratings ever in 2018, E!’s coverage losses well outpaced those of ABC’s Oscars broadcast, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  But plenty of stars did visit with Seacrest before the awards and some even offered some support. An exchange between Seacrest and Taraji P. Henson generated speculation that the actress was throwing shade, though she later clarified that her intention was to encourage him.  Seacrest’s Net Worth  For all the claims that the #MeToo movement may go too far and tarnish the careers of innocent men, Seacrest stands as a decisive counterpoint.  His Monday morning ratings on Live with Kelly and Ryan following the Oscars were the highest since he’s joined the show. Seacrest returns to host the new American Idol on Sunday, Mar. 11 in a premiere that has been heavily promoted by ABC.  The network shelled out $150 million in October to resign the Kardashian-Jenner clan for five more seasons of Keeping up with the Kardashians, which makes Seacrest about $15 million each year as the show’s producer.  Last year he also signed a multi-year deal with ABC, just after becoming the permanent co-host of Live with Kelly and Ryan. In addition to his existing contracts for the morning show, American Idol, and the network’s live New Year’s Eve show, Ryan Seacrest Productions will now create scripted content for ABC.  With all these deals, the 46-year-old’s net worth is now estimated to be $380 million.  While many claims of harassment never make it past human resources, the internal investigation does not definitively clear Seacrest’s name in any legal sense or mitigate the motives the network has to keep him on as a successful producer and personality.  Whatever the details of the E! investigation, his producer role on major shows and his status as one of the top-earning celebrities give him significant pull in the industry.	1
Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.  Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party  Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable?  photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty  May 2011: Billboard Music Awards  Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.  photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty  November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently  Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.  photography via instagram.com/ashilrd  January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber  They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it.  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards  The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split.  photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin    December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours  Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).  photography via instagram.com/zedd  January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin  Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.  photography via instagram.com/selenamylight  September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE  Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.  photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator  November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”.  photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin  January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve  Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — rip jelena 2010-2018 (@thorsodn) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber 💕 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  📱| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 3, 2016 at 4:12pm PST  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Now I know what Love is A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 16, 2018 at 7:45pm PST  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — Hennessy ✨ (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best.	1
"U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the news that the administration will impose massive steel and aluminum tariffs on our allies in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.""This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We’ve been down this road before—blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression. 'Make America Great Again' shouldn’t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.'"""	0
"Another day, another celebrity breakup. According to reports, Sarah Hyland and Dominic Sherwood reportedly broke up after two years of dating. Hyland is one of the stars of ABC's Modern Family and Sherwood is one of the stars of Freeform's Shadowhunters. Fans are wondering: Why did Sarah Hyland and Dominic Sherwood break up? Elite Daily reached out to both Hyland and Sherwood's teams for comment, but did not hear back by time of publication.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Hyland and Sherwood's relationship had just run its course. And hey, I get that. Things are good for a while, and then you just realize you're not right for each other. It doesn't mean it was a bad relationship, it's just one that's over. The pair first met when they co-starred in Vampire Academy back in 2014. (Hyland has also had a recurring role on Sherwood's Shadowhunters recently.)  Hyland and Sherwood went public with their relationship in March 2015 when they were seen kissing at a Lakers game in Los Angeles. They used to post pictures of each other on their respective Instagrams all the time, but Hyland hasn't posted anything about Sherwood since April 15, and Sherwood hasn't posted anything about Hyland since April 22.  Of course, Instagram posts realistically have nothing to do with the status of any given relationship. But that's just about the only indication we've had that these two were going to call it quits (albeit a very, very small indication). They celebrated their two-year anniversary in Feb. 2017. Hyland posted about the anniversary on Instagram with a caption that read, ""Happy 2 year to my #1 @domsherwood.""  Sherwood talked about his love for Hyland in an interview with ET in Feb. 2017. In the interview, he said,  Sarah makes me want to be a better version of myself. That's what I love most about her. She inspires me to be the best version of me.  When she joined the cast of Shadowhunters, Sherwood said,  Everyone fell in love with her on set. It was a real joy ... She's been coming in since season one, coming to visit me. Having her on set as an actress was just phenomenal.  At this point it's unclear why Hyland and Sherwood broke up, but it was wonderful while it lasted!"	0
Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.	1
"Zendaya , queen of one-of-a-kind style and woke interviews , has the whole ""authenticity"" thing down pat. To her, the thought of not being 100 percent true to herself is cringeworthy—hence, why she was literally cringing as she revisited some of her old videos from her short stint as a vlogger.  The Spider-Man: Homecoming star posted a video in which she watched and critiqued YouTube videos created by her 14-year-old self, Elle reports . The peppy girl in the videos—whose catchphrase is ""don't forget to smile""—is admittedly quite a bit different from the Zendaya the world is used to seeing slay on red carpets and take down trolls on Twitter .  ""When I was younger, I genuinely felt that I had to make a persona that matched Rocky, which is the character that I used to play,"" she says of the old clips, referencing her character on Disney Channel's Shake It Up. ""This is back when I literally had an entire alter-ego, and this sh*t is so obnoxious — I can't even believe.""  As it turns out, 2017 Zendaya isn't really feeling 2010 Zendaya's schtick. ""'Happy smiley faces?' What the f*ck?"" she asks, genuinely horrified at the things her younger self said. ""I was trying to make this positive environment and trying to be this f*cking ray of sunshine. This is the most annoying sh*t I have ever seen in my entire life. And the thing is, at the time I was like, 'Oh, the kids are going to love it. It'll be cool. Whatever,'"" she said.  She goes on to mock her own, totally forced body language and word choices, and she even admits that her haters back in the day may have had a point. ""No wonder people were annoyed with me,"" she says. ""Like, 'Oh, she is annoying!' Yes, honey, I was!""  Zendaya continues to call out her 14-year-old self for 4-and-a-half straight minutes, at one point declaring: ""I need to delete these... because it's so fake."" Hey, she's nothing if not real.  Thankfully, the vids are all still online for the world's viewing pleasure. But for a truly meta experience, you can watch Zendaya watching herself, below:  Related: Why This Tweet Comparing Bella Thorne and Zendaya Is TOTALLY Unfair"	0
"It's called method acting... How very Daniel Day-Lewis!  Remember the days when Pirates of Caribbean actor Johnny Depp was Hollywood's most-desired hunk? Well, that ship has well and truly sailed. Now fans are concerned there's something seriously wrong with the 54-year-old. Over the weekend, photos emerged of Johnny posing with fans at the Four Seasons hotel in St Petersburg, Russia. And he looked VERY different.  Looking at the snaps, Amber Heard's ex-husband cuts a pale and gaunt figure. Fans were also quick to point out just how much weight he appears to have lost, with many speculating it could be a result of potential illness or stress.  Johnny Depp: Then and now  ← Slide →  ← Slide →  ""Is he good health wise?"" one person asked, while another guessed, ""It's either stress or he real sick. I'm praying it's for a movie."" And they could be right. Johnny, who is currently touring with his rock tribute band the Hollywood Vampires, is starring in a new film called Richard Says Goodbye.  In the film, the actor is portraying Richard - a college professor who is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Onlookers who've seen Johnny recently agree that this could be the reason behind his drastic transformation. One person took to Twitter, advising the photos that sparked concerns were actually misleading. @its_batcounty claimed they saw Johnny in concert and he looked well. The message encouraged others to share their recent Johnny Depp encounters - all sounding very positive.  There was a time when Johnny was deemed Hollywood's leading heartthrob.  Despite the seemingly reasonable explanation - some pals close to Johnny are concerned. Chatting to Globe magazine, one insider claimed: ""Johnny looks like walking death."" They alleged, ""He lost 35 pounds (15-kilos) in a brief amount of time."""	1

"Actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has launched another attack on the religion’s most famous member, Tom Cruise, declaring the movie star is “diabolical.”  Remini has been an outspoken critic of the church since leaving in 2013, receiving critical acclaim for her documentary series ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.""  In a Reddit AMA to promote the second season of the show, Remini was asked if she thought Tom Cruise, a Scientologist since 1990, was a “good person."" Her response was blunt.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Jun 28, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT  “No! Just going to get straight to it, no! There is a public persona of the guy who looks at you directly in the eye and shakes your hand and hugs you and is an attentive person to you and there’s the person behind the mask who is a completely different person,” she wrote.  “Someone could say we all have that — what we are to the public and who we are behind the scenes, but the people who are around Tom and work for Tom, not even people who are Scientologists, they will say he is diabolical,” she continued.  “People who’ve worked with me will say I can be an a-----e — all actors can be. That is different. He’s very similar to David Miscavige, they could be twins.”  This isn’t the first time Remini’s spoken publicly about the most famous Scientologist in the world — in an interview with Larry King late last year, she said she suspected Cruise thought she was “the devil” for leaving the religion.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Apr 14, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT  “Tom and most Scientologists, all Scientologists, are taught to believe that people like me are literally the devil, that we mean them harm,” she said.  “Tom is very well-aware of what is Scientology, truthfully. He is very well-aware that it’s an organization that is defrauding people out of their lives.  “But in his heart, I believe he believes it.”  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Mar 3, 2017 at 7:38pm PST  Asked by another Reddit user how she’s now treated by Scientologists in Hollywood, Remini responded:  “They ignore me and walk out of rooms.”  This comes just days after ""Handmaid’s Tale"" actress and lifelong Scientologist Elisabeth Moss reportedly left the room at the Television Critics Association Awards when Remini took to the stage to accept an award.  “Elisabeth Moss believes that she can’t talk to me,” told Remini in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published three days after the incident.  “There’s a thing in Scientology called ‘acceptable truth.’ It means you only say what’s acceptable to the public. But she believes that I’m an anti-social personality — because I’ve spoken out against Scientology. So she isn’t allowed to talk to me. And me knowing that, I wouldn’t put her in the awkward position.”  Moss does appear alongside Cruise’s ex-wife Nicole Kidman, who is believed to have left the church after their 2001 divorce, in the new season of drama ""Top Of The Lake.""The pair also appear together in an hour-long roundtable video interview with The Hollywood Reporter:  This article originally appeared in news.com.au."	1
Aww! Robert Pattison was cracking up like the rest of us at Kristen Stewart’s hilarious opening monologue on ‘Saturday Night Live.’ HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVE details on on how he loved being included in her jokes that had the audience in stitches.  Yo go girl! Kristen Stewart absolutely crushed it at comedy when she hosted Saturday Night Live Feb. 4, and her ex Robert Pattinson, 30, is giving her big applause. She mentioned him in jokes for her opening monologue and not only was he totally okay with it, he’s thrilled that she did it! “Rob saws snippets from the show and absolutely loved Kristen’s opening monologue. He thought she was hilarious. He was happy to see her having so much fun and being so at ease with herself,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  K-Stew kicked off her opening bit by reminding the audience how Donald Trump, 70, lost it on Twitter when she cheated on her Twilight co-star back in 2012. “Four years ago I was dating this guy named Robert and we broke up and got back together and for some reason it made Donald Trump go insane,” she joked. She went on to read an actual tweet that our new president put up, where he ranted that she “cheated on him like a dog” and that he shouldn’t take her back. It is so unbelievable to think that the leader of the free world once got involved in a Twitter rage about Kristen’s love life, and that wasn’t lost on her.  Kristin reminded us that our ranter-in-chief tweeted a total of 11 times about their romance drama, including “Everyone knows that I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart.” She got huge laughs when she said that Donald was totally in love with her former boyfriend and that if he didn’t like her back then, he wouldn’t like her now cause “I’m like so gay, dude.” Oddly enough, for once Donald didn’t hop on his Twitter account and respond. After Kristen totally schooled him, it was probably best to keep quiet.  HollywoodLifers, what did you think of Kristen on SNL? Did you have any idea that she could be so funny?	1
"Jared Kushner (left), adviser to President Donald Trump, and Kim Kardashian West (right) are reportedly in talks to pardon a 62-year-old grandmother serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense.  One week after Kourtney Kardashian took Capitol Hill, E! News has learned Kim Kardashian West is in talks with the White House.  The ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star's rep confirmed Wednesday that Kardashian West and Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, are speaking. This news follows Mic's report that Kardashian West and Ivanka Trump's husband are in talks about a ""possible presidential pardon or clemency"" for 62-year-old great-grandmother Alice Marie Johnson.  Johnson is currently serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. It's been more than 20 years since she began her sentence in federal prison in October 1996.

""I struggled financially, I couldn't find a job fast enough to take care of my family. I felt like a failure, I went into a complete panic and out of desperation, I made one of the worst decisions of my life to make some quick money.""  She continued, ""I became involved in a drug conspiracy.""  Kardashian West first publicly discussed Johnson's case back in October 2017 when she tweeted an article about her imprisonment.  ""This is so unfair,"" Kardashian West wrote to her Twitter followers.  The following month, the New York Daily News reported that Kardashian West had enlisted her lawyer to ""help the clemency campaigns"" of Johnson and Cyntoia Brown.  Kardashian West's lawyer, Shawn Holley, told the publication at the time that Johnson ""has been a model prisoner and has the support of the warden, government officials and a host of others in her bid for release.""  ‘Tonight’: Miley Cyrus Updates 'Santa Baby' for 2018  Miley Cyrus changes some questionable lyrics to the holiday classic ""Santa Baby"" to better represent 2018, while Jimmy Fallon and Mark Ronson try to keep up.

"Hollywood star Angelina Jolie's fans have expressed their concern over the actress' bold style statement when meeting the head of the Church of England.  On Thursday (16 March), the 41-year-old actress sat down with Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to discuss pressing issues; unfortunately, it was her alleged braless look that grabbed eyeballs sending Twitter into a meltdown.  Fans shocked by the actress' daring outfit began criticising her soon after her pictures from the meeting were tweeted by the Anglican leader.  ""Privilege to welcome UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie. Discussed refugee crisis, South Sudan and prevention of sexual violence in conflict,"" the archbishop had captioned the pictures.  ""She needs a bra. Looks like she could poke someone's eye out. How embarrassing!"" a shocked viewer wrote on Twitter. Another user mockingly asked the archbishop to maintain his focus, ""Eyes up, Archbishop!"" the tweet read.  One of the angry tweets branded her ""shameless"" while another furious tweet said: ""Angelina Jolie is a trick ass ho in this pic. You are meeting religious figures, wear a goddamn bra.""  Jolie met the Archbishop to discuss topics such as sexual violence, the refugee crisis and South Sudan. However, on social media at least, the focus was on her clothing — a full-sleeved grey sweater and an ivory-pleated skirt.  Welby, on the other hand, only had good words for the global star. ""The role of the U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy on Refugees, Angelina Jolie Pitt, is one that has been extraordinary,"" he said.  ""What she said just now sums up so beautifully the issues we are facing, and puts it so precisely in terms of the challenge that there is. It's wonderful that she has committed her time, her energy, and has taken great personal risks in order to be able to speak authentically as to what she's done.""

"Kim DePaola can't say enough good things about how Dr. Terry Dubrow fixed her life — and her previously, um, botched boob job, as fans will get to see on Botched this week. And, it truly was a bit of a meeting of the Bravolebs when The Real Housewives of New Jersey pal came face to face with former Househusbands Terry and Dr. Paul Nassif.  ""Well, I knew a little bit about her and I knew that she just had that really terrible thing happen to her.

"George Timothy Clooney (born May 6, 1961) is an American actor, filmmaker and businessman. He is the recipient of three Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards, one for acting in Syriana (2006) and the other for co-producing Argo (2012). In 2018, he was the recipient of the AFI Live Achievement Award, at the age of 57.[3]  Clooney made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the long-running medical drama ER, from 1994 to 1999, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. While working on ER, he began attracting a variety of leading roles in films, with his breakthrough role in From Dusk till Dawn (1996),[4][5] and the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), in which he first worked with director Steven Soderbergh, who would become a long-time collaborator. In 1999, he took the lead role in Three Kings, a well-received war satire, set during the Gulf War.  In 2001, Clooney's fame widened with the release of his biggest commercial success, the heist comedy remake Ocean's Eleven, the first of what became a trilogy, starring Clooney. He made his directorial debut a year later with the biographical spy comedy Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and has since directed the historical drama Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), the sports comedy Leatherheads (2008), the political drama The Ides of March (2011), and the war film The Monuments Men (2014). Clooney won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the Middle East thriller Syriana (2005), and subsequently earned Best Actor nominations for the legal thriller Michael Clayton (2007) and the comedy-dramas Up in the Air (2009) and The Descendants (2011). In 2013, he received the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing the political thriller Argo. He has been nominated for Academy Awards in six different categories, a record he shares with Walt Disney.[6][7]  In 2009, Clooney was included in Time's annual Time 100 as one of the ""Most Influential People in the World"".[8] He is also noted for his political and economic activism, and has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since January 31, 2008.[9][10][11] He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[12]  Early life  Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky.[13][14] His mother, Nina Bruce (née Warren),[15] was a beauty queen and city councilwoman. His father, Nick Clooney, is a former anchorman and television host, including five years on the AMC network.[16] Clooney is of Irish, German, and English ancestry.[17] His maternal great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Ann Sparrow, was the half-sister of Nancy Lincoln, mother of President Abraham Lincoln.[18][19][20] Clooney has an older sister named Adelia (known as Ada).[21] Cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney was an aunt.[13] Through Rosemary, his cousins include actors Miguel Ferrer, Rafael Ferrer, and Gabriel Ferrer, who is married to singer Debby Boone.[22]  Clooney was raised a strict Roman Catholic[23] but said in 2006 that he did not know if he believed ""in Heaven, or even God.""[24] He has said, ""Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group.""[25] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Columbus, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade.[26] In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a medical condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that ""yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed.""[25] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: ""It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you.""[27]  After his parents moved to Augusta, Kentucky, Clooney attended Augusta High School. He has stated that he earned all As and a B in school,[13] and played baseball and basketball. He tried out to play professional baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 1977, but he did not pass the first round of player cuts and was not offered a contract.[28] He attended Northern Kentucky University from 1979 to 1981, majoring in broadcast journalism, and very briefly attended the University of Cincinnati, but did not graduate from either.[29] He earned money selling women's shoes, insurance door-to-door, stocking shelves, working in construction, and cutting tobacco.[24][30]  Career  Early work, 1978–1993  Clooney's first role was as an extra in the television mini-series Centennial in 1978, which was based on the novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was partly filmed in Clooney's hometown of Augusta, Kentucky.[31][32] Clooney's first major role came in 1984 in the short-lived sitcom E/R (not to be confused with ER, the better-known hospital drama, on which Clooney also co-starred a decade later). He played a handyman on the series The Facts of Life and appeared as Bobby Hopkins, a detective, on an episode of The Golden Girls. His first prominent role was a semi-regular supporting role in the sitcom Roseanne, playing Roseanne Barr's supervisor Booker Brooks, followed by the role of a construction worker on Baby Talk, a co-starring role on the CBS drama Bodies of Evidence as Detective Ryan Walker, and then a year-long turn as Det. James Falconer on Sisters.

His first major Hollywood role was in the horror comedy-crime thriller From Dusk till Dawn, directed by Robert Rodriguez and co-starring Harvey Keitel. He followed its success with the romantic comedy One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer, and the action-thriller The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman. Clooney was then cast as Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which was a modest box office performer, but a critical failure (with Clooney himself calling the film ""a waste of money"").[41] In 1998, he co-starred in the crime-comedy Out of Sight opposite Jennifer Lopez, marking the first of his many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.[42] He also starred in Three Kings during the last weeks of his contract with ER.[43]  After ER, 2000–2010  After leaving ER, Clooney starred in the commercially successful films The Perfect Storm (2000), a disaster drama; and O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Clooney lost an arbitration vote 2–1, and withdrew from the union over the decision. He became a ""financial core status"" non-member, meaning he no longer has voting rights, and cannot run for office or attend membership meetings, according to the WGA's constitution.[53]  He next co-starred with Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey in the war parody comedy film The Men Who Stare at Goats, which was directed by Heslov and released in November 2009.

In his acceptance speech, Clooney said that ""Don and I ... stand here before you as failures. The simple truth is that when it comes to the atrocities in Darfur ... those people are not better off now than they were years ago.""[92] On January 18, 2008, the United Nations announced Clooney's appointment as a UN messenger of peace, effective January 31.[9][10]  Clooney conceived of and, with John Prendergast – human rights activist, co-founder of the Enough Project, and Strategic Advisor for Not on Our Watch Project – initiated the Satellite Sentinel Project (SSP), after an October 2010 trip to South Sudan. SSP aims to monitor armed activity for signs of renewed civil war between Sudan and South Sudan, and to detect and deter mass atrocities along the border regions there.[93]  Clooney and John Prendergast co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed piece in May 2011, titled ""Dancing with a dictator in Sudan"", arguing that:  President Omar al-Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, is escalating bombing and food aid obstruction in Darfur, and he now threatens the entire north-south peace process ... the evidence shows that incentives alone are insufficient to change Khartoum's calculations. International support should be sought immediately for denying debt relief, expanding the ICC indictments, diplomatically isolating the regime, suspending all non-humanitarian aid, obstructing state-controlled bank transactions and freezing accounts holding oil wealth diverted by senior regime officials.[94]  On March 16, 2012, Clooney was arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy for civil disobedience.[95][96] He intended to be arrested when he planned the protest.[96] Several other prominent participants were also arrested, including Martin Luther King III.[96] Clooney has been described as one of the most strident critics of Omar al-Bashir.[97]  Armenian Genocide  George Clooney is a keen supporter of the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. He is one of the chief associates of the 100 Lives Initiative, a project which aims to remember the lives lost during the event.[98] As part of the initiative, Clooney launched the Aurora Prize, which awards to those who risk their lives to prevent genocides and atrocities.[98][99] Clooney had also urged various American government officials to support the United States' recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[99] Clooney visited Armenia to commemorate the 101st anniversary of the event in April 2016.[100]  Syria  In May 2015, Clooney told the BBC that the Syrian conflict was too complicated politically to get involved in and he wanted to focus on helping the refugees.[101] In March 2016, he and his wife, Amal Clooney, met with Syrian refugees living in Berlin to mark the fifth anniversary of the conflict, before meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to thank her for her Germany's open-door policy.[102]  Gun control  In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[103]  Personal life  Relationships  Clooney married actress Talia Balsam in 1989; they divorced in 1993.[104]  Clooney and Alamuddin at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in 2016  Clooney became engaged to British-Lebanese human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin on April 28, 2014.[105][106] In July 2014, Clooney publicly criticized the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail after it claimed his fiancée's mother opposes their marriage on religious grounds.[107] When the tabloid apologized for its false story, Clooney refused to accept the apology. He called the paper ""the worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers.""[108] On August 7, 2014, Clooney and Alamuddin obtained marriage licenses at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea of the United Kingdom.[109] Alamuddin and Clooney were officially married on September 27, 2014, at Ca' Farsetti.[110] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome.[111] In 2015, Clooney and Alamuddin adopted a rescue dog, a bassett hound named Millie, from the San Gabriel Valley Humane Society.[112] On February 9, 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show, The Talk, that Amal was pregnant, and that they were expecting twins.[113] On June 6, 2017, Amal gave birth to a daughter, Ella, and a son, Alexander.[114]  Real estate  Clooney's main home is in Los Angeles.

His home in Italy is in the village of Laglio, on Lake Como,[115] near the former residence of Italian author Ada Negri.[116] Clooney also maintains a home in Los Cabos, Mexico, that is next door to the home of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber.[117] In 2014, Clooney and his new British wife Amal Alamuddin bought the Grade II listed[118] Mill House on an island in the River Thames at Sonning Eye in Oxfordshire, England[119] at a cost of around £10 million.[120]  Motorcycle accidents  On September 21, 2007, Clooney and then-girlfriend Sarah Larson were injured in a motorcycle accident in Weehawken, New Jersey, when his motorcycle was hit by a car. The driver of the car reported that Clooney attempted to pass him on the right,[121] while Clooney said that the driver signaled left and then decided to make an abrupt right turn and clipped his motorcycle. On October 9, 2007, more than two dozen staff at Palisades Medical Center were suspended without pay for looking at Clooney's medical records in violation of federal law.[122]  On July 10, 2018, Clooney was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle to film set in Sardinia.

However, Clooney has also lent his voice to South Park as Sparky the Dog in ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"" and as the emergency room doctor in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Clooney was caricatured in the American Dad! episode ""Tears of a Clooney"", in which Francine Smith plans to destroy him.[138]  Director Alexander Cartio made his debut feature film, Convincing Clooney, about a Los Angeles artist who, faced with rejection as an actor and screenwriter, arrives at a master plan trying to get Clooney to star in his first-ever low-budget short film.

The producers of BBC drama Ordeal by Innocence have explained the decision to recast and reshoot the Agatha Christie adaptation following sexual assault allegations made against original actor Ed Westwick.  Advertisement  Ordeal by Innocence was dropped from the BBC Christmas schedules after allegations of sexual assault were made against actor Westwick in November last year. Westwick strenuously denies the allegations.  Producers Mammoth Screen decided to reshoot parts of the series with another actor, 30-year-old English star Christian Cooke. Now director Sandra Goldbacher and producer Damien Timmer have explained in a new interview with Radio Times why the decision was made.  “Hundreds and hundreds of people’s work would have just gone,” director Goldbacher says in the new issue of Radio Times, “or been indefinitely delayed. Which would have been devastating for everyone.”  Goldbacher adds that she was encouraged by the example of director Ridley Scott, who recast and reshot Hollywood movie All the Money in the World with Christopher Plummer following allegations made against original star Kevin Spacey.  “I felt encouraged by Ridley Scott having done it. It was like a sort of talisman for us all: he’s done it, so we can do it,” she said.  A trailer for the re-worked BBC series was recently released, including Cooke as character Mickey Argyll.  Goldbacher and producer Damian Timmer explain in the new issue how they were able to bring the original cast and locations back for the re-shoots, despite the late notice and time constraints.  While original filming took place in the summer, the re-shoots were conducted in winter. As a consequence, Timmer explains, “the technical challenges were reversed. This time, we had the snow, not the sun.”  Both Ordeal by Innocence and All the Money in the World were re-cast in order for the production to go ahead. However, other projects including Netflix biopic Gore starring Spacey were shelved.  Timmer says in the interview that the experience of Ordeal by Innocence shows that the television and film industry is able to adapt to meet specific challenges.  “Every era throws up new challenges that impact on filming. You might always have shot a series in a location that suddenly becomes a terrorist zone. The industry adapts and finds ways of working around whatever the issues is at the time.”  Ordeal by Innocence will now be shown on BBC1 this Easter.

"(CNN) Taylor Swift has used her latest video to throw some shade and let the world know she's heard everything people have been saying about her.  Swift premiered the video for ""Look What You Made Me Do"" Sunday night at MTV's Video Music Awards and it was a lot to take in.  The singer, who had been keeping such a low profile for so long that fans had started to worry, posted in an Instagram caption over the weekend saying ""There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation.""  It was a clever tease, given that "" Reputation "" is the name of her new album set to drop on November 10.  There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 25, 2017 at 4:54am PDT  Since Tay has yet to give the low down on what it all means, we'll attempt to break it down for you:  The death of her rep  The singer gets right down to it, opening up her video with a tombstone that reads ""Here lies Taylor Swift's reputation"" before a zombie version of Swift climbs out of the grave.  And how did her reputation die?  The viewers don't get a cause of death, so one is left to assume Swift is making a statement about all the bad press she's gotten in the last year or so with everything from her break up and spat with producer and DJ Calvin Harris, to her highly-publicized falling out with rapper Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian.  Swift and the couple have had competing narratives as to whether Swift signed off on West calling her a ""b***h"" in a song lyric.  Some fans think Swift took a shot at West with the lyrics ""I don't like your little games, don't like your tilted stage/The role you made me play of the fool, no, I don't like you."" The rapper's last concert tour featured a floating and tilted stage.  The moment at the end of the video when Swift said ""Getting receipts, gonna edit this later"" as she pointed her camera phone and mimicked the act of recording a video was interpreted by some fans as a swipe at Kim Kardashian, who was said to have ""brought receipts"" to her husband's spat with the pop star.  Said ""receipts""-- an internet catchphrase used to call for proof or evidence -- was a video of a phone conversation between the rapper and Swift, which Kardashian said proved the singer knew about the song lyric she later complained about. Swift shot back at the time that no where did the video show her approving being called a ""b***h.""  Shading an old frenemy?  The internet also has some theories about a scene in which Swift dressed up to look like Katy Perry.  One fan tweeted a screen grab of the scene writing ""#TaylorSwift personates #KatyPerry holding a #Grammy because Taylor has plenty & Katy doesn't have one.""  The two have had a long-standing feud and interestingly enough Perry was the host of the VMAs this year.  Remember the Tay-shirt controversy?  Swift gave a nod to last year's hoopla over then-boyfriend actor Tom Hiddleston, who wore a white ""I Heart T.S."" tank while the pair frolicked with friends at the beach for Fourth of July weekend.  She cheekily had a group of male backup dancers wear crop tops with the same message, though in black, possibly to match the stilettos they rocked.  And if you dig the look, you too can proclaim your love as it's part of the merch for sale on her site.  Taylor Swift Is Selling the 'I Heart T.S.' Crop Tops From the 'Look What You Made Me... https://t.co/UwUDhSdmfT pic.twitter.com/y55sm3Ecxl — Major Celeb News (@MajorCeleb) August 28, 2017  Those snakes  ""Swifties,"" as her die-hard fans are known, were thrilled with the singer owning a bit of her hater history.  #TaylorSwiftIsASnake has been the hashtag for those on Twitter wishing to take the singer to task, and the reptiles showed up in her video, with one even serving her tea.  Old and new Taylor are never ever ever getting back together  Swift's many faces and signature looks of over the years made a stunning appearance rife with symbolism.  Dressed in a furry one-piece which read ""Rep,"" the new Swift stood on a mountain made up of the older versions of herself from different music videos and red carpet appearances.  The old Swifts fight to climb to the top before they are all seen falling away.  And if that imagery wasn't obvious enough, we see the new Swift saying into the phone ""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, cause she's dead.""  Swift mocks Swift  Those old Taylors help Swift close out her music video as she uses them to parody some of the stinging comments that have been made about her over the years.  There's earnest, nerdy Swift from the ""You Belong With Me"" video who was scolded by zombie Swift saying, ""Stop making that surprise face, it's so annoying.""  ""You can't possibly be that surprised all the time,"" said ballerina Swift, who appeared in the ""Shake It Off"" music video.  The just starting out, acoustic guitar version of Swift from her teen years was told to ""Stop acting like you're so nice, you are so fake"" by circus ringleader Swift from the 2012 MTV European Music Awards.  When baby Swift starts to cry, a nearby Swift says ""There she goes playing the victim, again.""  The video ends with the version of Swift who was famously interrupted by West during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.  Wearing that same off the shoulder gown and clutching her VMA award, Swift utters her now infamous line ""I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative"" which was part of her official statement to the whole West-Kardashian kerfuffle, to which the rest of the Swifts respond with a resounding ""Shut up!""  On Tuesday, YouTube announced that ""Look What You Made Me Do"" had the biggest debut of any video in its history with 43.2 million views in 24 hours.  The previous record holder was Psy's ""Gentleman"" with 36 million views in the first 24 hours."	1
Not okay.  Sexism is so rife in Hollywood it hardly comes as a surprise when (yet another) male director is accused of something vile towards an aspiring female actress.  Well, this time (in the 1,347th edition of Sexism In Hollywood) it isn’t an aspiring actress making the claim, but Emmy Rossum — Golden Globe nominated Emmy Rossum.  “My agent called me and was like, ‘I’m so embarrassed to make this call, but there’s a big movie and they’re going to offer it to you. They really love your work on the show. But the director wants you to come into his office in a bikini. There’s no audition. That’s all you have to do,” Rossum said during a comedy roundtable hosted by The Hollywood Reporter.  The worst part — and likely the part every woman can relate to — was that Rossum didn’t immediately dismiss the offer, because of such an ingrained culture of sexism whereby attitudes and expectations are actually just pretty normal occurrences. Relate?  “And I actually had this moment like, ‘Well, how good is the part?’” Rossum said. “For a second, I was like, ‘Would I do it? Send me the script. Maybe the character is in a bikini in the movie.’”  But upon getting her hands on the script, Rossum was horrified to know that nope, there was no bikini scene, and actually no nudity at all.  “We really love your work, but we just want to see how tight your ass is,” Rossum said, mimicking the director’s voice. “Are you fucking kidding me? Last time I checked, I’m not a fucking model.”  Yeah, last time we checked a good bum might be a prerequisite for the Victoria’s Secret fashion show but definitely not for much else.	0
"Selena Gomez has created such a huge name for herself as a singer, big-screen actress, and style star that it's easy to forget that she got her start on the Disney Channel, playing the lead role of Alex Russo on Wizards of Waverly Place from 2008 to 2012. The young songstress turns 24 on July 22 and like any child star trying to navigate their way through adulthood in the public eye, Selena's life hasn't been without pitfalls; she spent time in a treatment center for two weeks back in January 2014, a stay that her rep said was ""not for substance abuse,"" and has been at the center of rumors concerning her famous friendships with Taylor Swift, Kendall Jenner, and Demi Lovato, as well as her on-again, off-again romance with Justin Bieber (and let's not even get started on his recent career setbacks).  While Selena's journey has included its fair share of ups and downs, it's worth noting that the actress and singer seems to be experiencing a lot of the same things that many women in their early 20s go through; friends coming and going, relationships falling apart (and rekindling), doing a little partying, and even getting tattoos. We're taking a look back at Selena's evolution from cute Disney kid to smokin' hot Hollywood star — scroll through to see the memorable moments."	1
This marks the royal’s first official public appearance on his own since the wedding. We have learned that Prince Harry headed for a ‘private visit’ to Pitseng, Lesotho in South Africa without his new bride Meghan Markle.  Apparently, Harry is set to be in attendance at the opening of a brand new dining hall at the Phelisanong Children’s Centres on behalf of the charity he co-founded with close pal Prince Seeiso back in 2006.  One spokesperson for the charity Sentebale (‘forget me not’) released the following statement: ‘The Duke was on a private visit to view the work of Sentebale at a camp for helpless children and youngsters, as well as other projects funded by the same charity.

Entourage and Wisdom of the Crowd star Jeremy Piven has issued a statement strongly denying TV personality/actress Ariane Bellamar’s public accusations that the Emmy-winning actor groped her on the set of Entourage and at the Playboy Mansion several years ago.  “I unequivocally deny the appalling allegations being peddled about me. It did not happen,” Piven said in the statement to Deadline. “It takes a great deal of courage for victims to come forward with their histories, and my hope is that the allegations about me that didn’t happen, do not detract from stories that should be heard.”  Bellamar’s October 30 claims on Twitter quickly were picked up by mainstream media on Tuesday, prompting CBS, the network that airs Piven’s Wisdom of the Crowd, and HBO, which carried Entourage, to issue statements.  “We are aware of the media reports and are looking into the matter,” a CBS spokesperson said Tuesday.  Said HBO today: “Today, via the press reports, is the first we are hearing about Ariane Bellamar’s allegations concerning Jeremy Piven. Everyone at HBO and our productions is aware that zero tolerance for sexual harassment is our policy. Anyone experiencing an unsafe working environment has several avenues for making complaints that we take very seriously.”  Here is the trio of tweets by Bellamar about Piven and his alleged unwelcomed interactions with her, that triggered the response:  Hey @jeremypiven! ‘Member when you cornered me in your trailer on the #Entourage set? ‘Member grabbing my boobies on the 🛋 without asking?? — Ariane Bellamar (@ArianeBellamar) October 30, 2017  ‘Member when I tried to leave; you grabbed me by the ass, looked at yourself in the mirror, & said what a ‘beautiful couple’ we made? #MeToo https://t.co/liD7irs0o0 — Ariane Bellamar (@ArianeBellamar) October 30, 2017	0
Katie Holmes is not pregnant with Jamie Foxx’s baby, nor are the two planning a wedding together, despite a completely made-up tabloid report. Gossip Cop has repeatedly debunked rumors of the two getting married and starting a family, and we can do so yet again.  According to OK!, those close to the actor and actress believe she’s expecting his child, which will lead to the two walking down the aisle. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Katie is very traditional and has old-fashioned values. She’s made it clear to Jamie that there’s no way she would have a baby out of wedlock. He’ll be expected to step up to the plate.”  The outlet’s seemingly bogus insider adds, “With their romance finally out in the open they can start planning a future and stop all the tiptoeing around. Katie sees Jamie as perfect daddy material, and husband material too.” But as Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes only casually date. The two aren’t in a serious or committed relationship.	1

"The tweets kept coming. On April 15, a year after Kanye West deleted his Twitter account, he returned with a vengeance. Over the next days and weeks, his posts grew increasingly bizarre. “The psychological zombie effect,” read one. “I’m super chaaaaaarged. Bout to take this whole thing to mars,” read another. After he called himself the “future president,” bragged about having “dragon energy,” and announced he’d fired his manager because “I can’t be managed,” speculation spread across the Internet that the rapper, who spent eight days in a psych ward in 2016, was having another breakdown. Wife Kim Kardashian was swift to fight back, tweeting that the media is “so quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive.”  But Kanye’s problems are more serious than anyone knows, insiders say, and they’ve led to the disintegration of his marriage after nearly four years. “Kim is in talks with lawyers about getting a divorce,” a source exclusively tells Life & Style. “Kanye’s acting more unpredictable than ever. Things have gotten so bad that Kim and Kanye sleep in separate rooms.”  When she needs even more time apart from her husband, Kim, 37, flees their home and takes the kids — North, 4, Saint, 2, and 3-month-old Chicago — to stay at mom Kris Jenner’s house. There’s been no escaping his social media meltdown, though. In fact, roughly an hour after he professed his love for President Donald Trump online on April 25, Kanye, 40, admitted in another tweet that “my wife just called me” and told him to clarify that he doesn’t agree with everything Trump does. But Kanye doesn’t listen to Kim most of the time. She called him out on her own Twitter account the same day for posting photos inside their home when they’d agreed not to. Though she later insisted she was joking, “They fight constantly — blow-out fights,” says an insider. “Kanye needs professional help. He’s delusional and paranoid. He thinks he’s a savior. He talks to himself, and he talks to people who aren’t actually in the room because he thinks he’s being watched.”  Kim’s endured his behavior before, but now — with two young children and an infant at home — it’s become too much. “Kim is tired of covering for him and putting out fires that he keeps creating,” the insider says. “She can’t take it anymore.”  She initially didn’t want to give up on the marriage. Instead, she tried to stage an intervention for her husband, the insider says, but Kanye wasn’t having it. “He either got wind of it or just assumed it was coming because he told Kim, ‘Don’t even think about trying to do an intervention on me,’” reveals the insider. “He doesn’t want help — he thinks he’s fine. He says he doesn’t have any mental problems or issues with anything like addiction.”  Making matters worse, Kanye also announced he’s dropping two new albums in June. “Kim is pissed that he’ll be off traveling the world promoting his music while she’s left at home feeling like a single mom with three small kids,” says the source. “She accuses Kanye of being selfish and has told pals that she’s done with her husband always putting himself first.” Kanye, naturally, sees things differently. Stubborn Kanye “disagrees and blames ‘selfish’ Kim for their issues,” notes the source. “He doesn’t believe Kim is always there for him.”  She certainly was by his side in November 2016. On Nov. 21, Kanye was hand-cuffed to a gurney and admitted to LA’s UCLA Medical Center following four days of “crying fits, violence, sleep deprivation, and drug use” that were caught on videotape, according to a second insider. Kim, who had just landed in NYC when word of the breakdown reached her, immediately flew home to be by the designer’s side during his ensuing eight-day stay in the hospital. Hot 97 radio host Ebro Darden recently claimed Kanye told him being “addicted to opioids” led to the hospitalization — but that’s not what Kim and Kanye said at the time. Kim actually blamed the trauma of her own robbery at gunpoint in Paris a month earlier for Kanye’s psychological snap. When Kanye later filed suit against insurance company Lloyd’s (to get them to pay the $10.8M and fees he claimed they owed for 23 concerts that were canceled due to what he said was a “debilitating medical condition”), Lloyd’s alleged his breakdown was brought on by drug abuse. An attorney for the company claimed Kanye was seen on video saying he popped two Percocets at a time and “stated words to the effect that ‘this is all about getting off of drugs, bad drugs.’” But Kim said in sworn testimony that her husband only took one Percocet at a time and had a valid prescription. As for the liquid and traditional marijuana the rapper used? His lawyers pointed out that it had been legalized in California. The case was finally dismissed in February 2018 with both parties saying the matter had been “amicably” resolved.  Party of 5 A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 23, 2018 at 7:25am PDT  Kanye kept a low profile for months after he left UCLA. But now his bizarre behavior has Kim experiencing déjà vu. “She’s afraid for Kanye, herself, and her family. That’s the main reason Kim wants a divorce,” says the insider. “She’s tired of the confrontations. She wants a clean break.”  One thing she doesn’t have to worry about: protecting her $175 million fortune. “She’s relieved to have a prenup in place,” says the source. Kanye, who announced on Twitter in 2016 that he had $53 million in personal debt, “is known for spending money like water, and his finances have been up and down for years. With him acting up right now, she’s afraid he’ll make irrational decisions and splash out millions on anything and everything. She’s spent years building her brand and is determined to protect her assets no matter what it takes.”  Smart move. “He really has no respect for the dollar,” rapper pal GLC, who grew up with Kanye in Chicago, tells Life & Style. “I remember him spending outrageously. He might have a couple tens of thousands of dollars to his name but when it was time to be on the road and make appearances, he’d spend it on clothes.”  No one’s as protective of the Kardashian fortune as Kris, 62. But surprisingly, she’s taking her son-in-law’s side, both publicly and privately. On April 24, after reports surfaced that Kanye was hard to deal with and fighting with Kris and Kim, the momager tweeted, “Lies, Lies, Lies” and “Nope...not true!” She’s just trying to cover for Kanye, says the insider. But even behind closed doors, she isn’t throwing him under the bus. “Kris is trying to persuade Kim to work things out with Kanye,” says the source. “She sees them as the ultimate power couple and wants to keep it that way. Despite Kanye’s faults, Kris likes him and thinks he’s a great dad. She’s trying to talk Kim out of filing for divorce.”  It will be an uphill battle for Kris. “Kim has tried over and over again to work things out with Kanye, and has come to the conclusion that a leopard doesn’t change its spots,” says the source. “She’s finally reached her breaking point,” adds the insider. “There’s no way to work this out.”  Love the Kardashian kids?

"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also"	1

Following the deadliest mass shooting in American history, in which at least 58 people were killed and 500 wounded at a musical festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night, artists, actors and other celebrities from around the country are now using their platform in the hopes of advancing the conversation about gun control.  Since identified as Stephen Paddock, the shooter opened fire on a crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, stationed across the street from the outdoor venue where country singer Jason Aldean was performing at the time. The police uncovered at least 10 rifles in Paddock’s room, including hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Eric Paddock, the brother of the suspect, told reporters on Monday that Stephen Paddock legally owned “a couple” of handguns and may have owned one long gun, “but he had them in a safe.” It’s still unclear how Paddock came into possession of so many rifles.  In a ten-tweet-long thread, John Mayer laid out a passionate argument for immediate change with regards to gun control. “I’m going to state my thoughts without the words ‘gun control’ ‘assault rifles’ and others that stoke reflexive debate,” he began. “I’m a logic and reason guy. I like to remove emotion (impossible today) and look at an issue in a theoretical vacuum to make sense of it. Lawmakers and influencers: if you’re not doing everything in your power to at least *reassess* the threat of mass murder, why can’t you come out and tell us that this is the life we’re going to have to accept? That these are the new terms? That it’s a fact of modern day life that from time to time we’ll lose dozens of people in seconds? That daily life is a lottery system? And if you can’t say that, if it’s just too cold and brutal a thought to bear, then isn’t that proof you haven’t solved the problem yet?  He continue: “If you’re not at least trying to fix this, you’re effectively telling the country in your (in)actions that this somehow acceptable. There’s two moralities: morality identity and morality-in-action. Our greater moral identity doesn’t match our actions so far.9) If you’re not open minded to solving this, you’re morally surrendering us all to a very certain fate. There is no in between here. **Please use the energy normally allotted to fighting this argument to rethinking this problem.** Unless you don’t think there is one…”  Billy Eichner was likewise outspoken. After tweeting “enough already” in all caps, the Difficult People and American Horror Story: Cult star questioned why congress hasn’t been pushed more on the matter since Sandy Hook.  GUN CONTROL NOW. ENOUGH ALREADY. GROW THE FUCK UP. THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN’T NEED A FUCKING MACHINE GUN. ENOUGH ALREADY. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  AND DON’T TALK ABOUT THE 2ND AMENDMFNT.

Think about how INSANE that is. We’re calling Congress about everything else, why not this?? — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  Lady Gaga shared a similar message, asking Democrats and Republicans to unite to bring an end to “terrorism.” She then directed a tweet towards Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, urging them to “act quickly” on gun control.  This is terrorism plain and simple. Terror bares no race, gender or religion. Democrats & Republicans please unite now #guncontrol ?? — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017  Prayers are important but @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump blood is on the hands of those who have power to legislate. #GunControl act quickly. https://t.co/bXZQ7enuEp — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017  Emmy Rossum, best known for playing the character Fiona Gallagher on Shameless, also tweeted at Trump calling for action.  Dear @realDonaldTrump, the people of Las Vegas don’t need your hashtags and empty tweets about “warmest condolences”. They need action. — Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) October 2, 2017  I believe in prayer, but it’s not enough by itself. We need better LAWS. In no world does a CIVILIAN need a MACHINE GUN. Let’s fix this. — Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) October 2, 2017  John Legend said the news was “heartbreaking” and “devastating” in his own tweet before retweeting Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden on the need for gun control.  The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017  Our grief isn’t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017  How long do we let gun violence tear families apart? Enough. Congress & the WH should act now to save lives. There’s no excuse for inaction. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2017  Gaga’s fellow pop star Ariana Grande, whose concert in Manchester, England earlier this year was the target of a bombing that killed 22 people, called for “love, unity, peace, gun control.”  My heart is breaking for Las Vegas. We need love, unity, peace, gun control & for people to look at this & call this what it is = terrorism. — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) October 2, 2017  Mark Ruffalo (as well as Julianne Moore, in a similar message) encouraged everyone to join the movement to end gun violence by texting Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization that works with lawmakers to pass “common-sense laws and policies that save lives.”  Today we mourn for Las Vegas, tomorrow we fight for them.

Nearly three months ago, Jimmy Kimmel broke down in tears during a powerful monologue on his late-night show about his newborn son’s recent open heart surgery.  His candor drew much-needed attention to the importance of providing all Americans, especially those with pre-existing conditions like his son, with adequate health care.  On Friday, Kimmel took to Twitter to share the first photo of William “Billy” Kimmel since opening up about his health struggles.  “Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got,” Kimmel wrote alongside a photo of his smiling baby boy.  Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got pic.twitter.com/XcvvM6XFJ3 — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) July 21, 2017  Kimmel’s wife and co-head writer Molly McNearney also posted an update with a different photo of their son looking just as happy, encouraging Americans once again to get involved in health care reform.  “Billy’s looking out for a lot of his buddies at Children’s Hospital. Remind your Congresspeople to protect them,” she wrote.  Billy's looking out for a lot of his buddies at Children's Hospital. Remind your Congresspeople to protect them. pic.twitter.com/UbFp2UgqGH — Molly McNearney (@mollymcnearney) July 21, 2017  After welcoming their son in April, Kimmel and McNearney learned that Billy had congenital heart disease. The newborn underwent a successful open-heart surgery at just three days old and returned home six days later.  “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was,” Kimmel explained at the time, “there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition.”  The speech quickly went viral as the Republican-dominated Senate debated repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a new health care plan that threatens to cut funding for millions, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.  He also revealed that his son will likely needed an additional surgery somewhere between the ages of 3- and 6-months-old.	0
"Cheryl Ann Tweedy[1] (born 30 June 1983) is an English singer, songwriter and television personality. Born and raised in Newcastle upon Tyne, she rose to fame in late 2002 upon winning a place in Girls Aloud, a girl group created through ITV's Popstars: The Rivals. While still in the group, she began a solo career in April 2009, and between then and 2014, she released four studio albums – 3 Words (2009), Messy Little Raindrops (2010), A Million Lights (2012) and Only Human (2014). Collectively, the albums included ten singles, five of which – ""Fight for This Love, ""Promise This"", ""Call My Name"", ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""I Don't Care"" – reached the top position on the UK Singles Chart. Cheryl was the first British female solo artist to have five number-one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018.  Cheryl became a judge on the UK version of The X Factor in 2008. She mentored two of the eventual winners of the competition (Alexandra Burke in series five and Joe McElderry in series six), before resigning in 2011 and joining the panel of the American version, which she left during the auditions stage. She returned to judge series 11 and 12 of the UK version.  Cheryl has become a recognised and photographed style icon, being referred to as a ""fashionista"" by the press.[2] She has been photographed for the covers of British Vogue, Elle and Harper's Bazaar, and fronted cosmetic company L'Oréal from 2009 to 2018. Her net worth was estimated at £20 million in October 2014.[3][4] Cheryl was married to England footballer Ashley Cole from July 2006 to September 2010. She married Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in July 2014, and was granted a decree nisi from him in October 2016. From 2016 to 2018, she was in a relationship with One Direction singer Liam Payne, with whom she has a son born in March 2017.  Early life  Cheryl Ann Tweedy[5] was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 30 June 1983,[6] and grew up on council estates in the suburbs of Walker[7] and Heaton. She is the fourth of five children of Joan Callaghan,[8] and the first of her two children with Garry Tweedy following the collapse of her marriage to the father of her three other children. Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was 11 years old.[9]  At the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas.[10] Interested in dancing from an early age, she began sequence dancing at the age of four,[11] before joining The Royal Ballet's summer school at the age of nine.[12] She occasionally appeared doing dance recitals on different television shows in the UK, such as Gimme 5, in 1993.[13]  Career  2002–2009: Popstars: The Rivals and Girls Aloud  Cheryl (far right) with Girls Aloud performing at the Capital Radio Help a London Child fundraiser, 2005.  Cheryl auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, which aimed to create a boy band and a girl group to compete for the Christmas number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. She sang ""Have You Ever"" in her audition,[14] and was one of twenty contestants (ten girls and ten boys) chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. The finalists performed live on Saturday evenings, with one gender performing each week, and each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the five-piece groups emerged. Cheryl was in danger of elimination twice, surviving over Emma Beard[15] and Aimee Kearsley[16] in consecutive performing weeks. On 30 November 2002, she was the first contestant to qualify for the girl group, and was joined by Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to form Girls Aloud, following the final public vote.[17] The group's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one over boy band One True Voice's ""Sacred Trust / After You're Gone"".[18] Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between being formed as a band and achieving a number one single.[19]  Girls Aloud released their debut album Sound of the Underground in May 2003,[20] which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles ""I'll Stand by You"", ""Walk This Way"", and ""The Promise"" charted at number one. Two of their albums reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album The Sound of Girls Aloud and 2008's Out of Control, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold.[21] They also achieved seven certified albums and were nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for ""The Promise"".[22] The group's musical style was pop, but throughout their career they experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim,[23] due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group amassed a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for ""Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group"" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone.[24][25] Girls Aloud took a hiatus in 2009 in the pursuit of solo projects, saying they would reunite for a new studio album in 2010,[26] but this did not materialise.  2008–2011: Television endeavours, 3 Words and Messy Little Raindrops  In 2008, Cheryl replaced Sharon Osbourne as a judge for the fifth series of The X Factor alongside creator Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh. She was given the girls category (made up of female solo contestants aged 16 to 25) and subsequently ended up as the winning judge when Alexandra Burke was crowned the winner of series five on 13 December.[27] She returned for the sixth series in 2009 and was given the boys category (made up of male solo contestants aged 16 to 25).[28] She was the winning judge for a second consecutive year when Joe McElderry won on 13 December.[29] Cowell referred to her as ""one of the best I've ever worked with.""[30] Cheryl returned for the seventh series in 2010 and mentored the girls category again.[31] This was the first series in which she was not the winning mentor, when Rebecca Ferguson finished as runner-up to Matt Cardle, who was mentored by Minogue. In 2011, Cheryl joined Cowell, L.A. Reid, and Paula Abdul on the judging panel of the American version of The X Factor.[32] After a three-week stint she departed the series.[33] Cowell said that the reason why she left was because he offered her a place on the 2011 series of the UK version and he felt that she would have been more comfortable there.[34] Cheryl did not return to the UK version, as Tulisa had taken her place on the UK judging panel.[35] Nicole Scherzinger replaced her on the judging panel of the American version for the rest of season one.[36] In December 2012, Cheryl sued the American producers of The X Factor for $2.3 million (£1.4m). She received $1.8 million (£1.1m) for the first season, and then sued for $2 million (£1.25m) for the second season, plus additional damages.[37] In November 2013, Cheryl won for her settlement, for an undisclosed amount between her and producers Blue Orbit.[38]  Cheryl's first solo performance was on American rapper will.i.am's ""Heartbreaker"" in 2008. She was picked to appear as a dancer in the video after taking streetdancing classes during the filming of ITV2 series The Passions of Girls Aloud.[39] She was later asked by will.i.am to sing additional vocals on the track.[40] In April 2009, she started working on solo material,[41] and her debut album, 3 Words, was released in the UK on 26 October.[42] The album spent two weeks at number one,[43] and on 6 November, BPI certified the album platinum, denoting shipments of over 300,000 units; it later tripled this feat.[44] The first single from the album, ""Fight for This Love"", was written by Andre Merritt, Steve Kipner and Wayne Wilkins, and produced by Kipner and Wilkins. Following a performance on The X Factor live results show, ""Fight for This Love"" entered the UK and Irish charts at number one,[45] and in 2010, it went to number one in Denmark, Norway and Hungary,[46] and was later certified platinum in the UK.[44] It also became the fourth best-selling single of 2009 in the UK.[47] Cheryl's second single, ""3 Words"", which features will.i.am, went to number four in the UK and seven in Ireland.[48][49] In 2010, the single was released in Australia and charted at number five, and was certified platinum.[50] The third single, ""Parachute"", charted in the top five in both the UK and Ireland, and was certified gold in the UK.[51][49][44]  Cheryl started recording sessions for her second album in February 2010,[52] though in an interview on Alan Carr: Chatty Man, she said that some of the songs submitted for the record dated back to 3 Words.[53] The album was largely produced by Wayne Wilkins[54] and released on 29 October 2010 under the title Messy Little Raindrops. It features guest vocals from August Rigo, Dizzee Rascal, Travie McCoy, and will.i.am,[55] and debuted at number one in the UK, and at number two in Ireland.[51][49] It received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with a positive review of four out of five stars from Jon O'Brien of Allmusic.[56] On 19 August 2011, the album was certified platinum by BPI, with shipments in the UK exceeding 300,000.[44] The album's first single, ""Promise This"", is an up-tempo dance-pop song written by Wilkins, Priscilla Hamilton and Christopher Jackson,[57][58] which was released on 24 October 2010 and became her second number-one in the UK where it was certified gold.[59] ""The Flood"" was released as the album's second single and entered the charts after its official release at number 18.[51]  Cheryl was given a one-off television programme for ITV1, Cheryl Cole's Night In, which aired on 19 December 2009.[60] The programme, hosted by Holly Willoughby, featured music and interviews with Cheryl and some of her favourite performers. Alexandra Burke, Rihanna, Will Young, Snow Patrol and will.i.am made appearances.[61] The programme attracted 5 million viewers on its first airing.[62]  From May to July 2010, Cheryl was the opening act for The Black Eyed Peas at the British shows (as well as some European dates) of The E.N.D. World Tour.[63][64][65] Cheryl was interviewed during an episode of the fourth series of Piers Morgan's Life Stories, in which she discussed her marriage and divorce with Ashley Cole and her life-threatening battle with malaria. The show, which aired on 23 October 2010, drew an audience of 7.2 million, the highest figure in the chat show's history.[66]  2012–2013: A Million Lights, Girls Aloud reunion and tours  Cheryl's third studio album, A Million Lights, was released on 18 June 2012.[67] It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, selling 34,934 copies in its first week on sale, and was her first not to debut at number one in the UK and her first not to sell over 100,000 copies in its first week.[68] Her debut album 3 Words sold 125,000 copies while its follow-up Messy Little Raindrops sold around 105,000 copies.[68] A Million Lights was certified gold in the UK for shipments of 100,000 copies.[44] The lead single ""Call My Name"", became Cheryl's third number one single on the UK Singles Chart, with the sales of 152,001 digital copies. The song became 2012's fastest selling number one single on the UK Singles Chart until December of the same year,[69] when the winner of that year's series of The X Factor, James Arthur, sold 490,560 copies with his cover of Shontelle's ""Impossible"".[70] ""Call My Name"" sold a total of 417,000 copies in the UK, and was the 34th best-selling single of 2012 there.[71] ""Under the Sun"", the second single from the album, was released on 2 September 2012,[72][73] and peaked at number 13, becoming her seventh consecutive solo top-twenty single. To promote A Million Lights, Cheryl embarked on her first solo concert tour, A Million Lights Tour. The tour ran from 3 to 17 October 2012, and comprised 11 show dates: two in Ireland, one in Scotland and eight in England. She also did a set of meet and greets at each concert. The £350 offer included an autograph, a chance to meet her and a photograph with her backstage, with proceeds going towards her charity, The Cheryl Cole Foundation. The meet and greet ticket drew negative criticism from fans, who complained about the high price.[74][75]  On 4 June 2012, Cheryl performed a duet with Gary Barlow at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was organised and created by Barlow as part of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II and watched by millions worldwide.[76][77] In 2012, Cheryl returned to The X Factor as a guest mentor to help Barlow pick his contestants for the live shows of the competition. In November 2012, she was handed her own documentary entitled Cheryl: Access All Areas, which attracted 811,000 viewers on ITV2 and 177,000 on +1.[78]  In November 2012, after months of speculation, Girls Aloud reunited for the group's 10th anniversary. On 18 November, they released their comeback single, ""Something New"", which was also the official charity single for Children in Need 2012. The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart.[79] The group released their second greatest hits compilation, Ten, on 26 November 2012. The second single taken from Ten, ""Beautiful Cause You Love Me"", was released on 17 December.[80] A documentary entitled Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top aired on ITV1 on 15 December[81] and attracted 2.3 million viewers, a 10.5% share of the audience.[82] In 2013, the group embarked on Ten: The Hits Tour.[83][84] In March 2013, following the completion of the tour, Girls Aloud released a statement to confirm that they were splitting permanently.[85][86]  2014–2017: Only Human and The X Factor return  In June 2014, Cheryl debuted the first single from her fourth studio album Only Human, ""Crazy Stupid Love"", which features Tinie Tempah.[87] Later in the month, she performed at Capital FM's Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium.[88] ""Crazy Stupid Love"" was officially released in July and entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, selling 118,000 copies. It became Cheryl's fourth number one single on the chart, making her the third British female artist to achieve four numbers ones as a solo artist, after Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora.[89] The song also peaked at number one in Ireland.[49] The second single from Only Human, ""I Don't Care"", was released on 2 November and similarly to its predecessor debuted at number one in the UK, becoming Cheryl's fifth number one in the country. This made her the first British female to have five solo number one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018.[90][91] Only Human was released on 10 November and became Cheryl's fourth solo album to debut within the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[51][49] It was later certified silver in the UK.[44] The album's title track was released as its third and final single in March 2015. The song, which originally peaked at number 70 as an album cut in October 2014, failed to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart upon the single's release, therefore becoming Cheryl's lowest-charting single to date.[92]  In 2014, the singer also returned as a judge on the UK version of The X Factor for its 11th series to replace Sharon Osbourne, signing a £1.5 million contract.[93][94] She was joined by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Mel B on the judging panel. She was again selected to mentor the girls category, with her final act Lauren Platt coming fourth. In 2015, Cheryl returned to The X Factor for its 12th series; she was joined by Cowell and new judges Ora and Nick Grimshaw.[95] She was selected to mentor the groups category for the first time and her last remaining group Reggie 'n' Bollie reached the final finishing in second place. Cheryl announced her departure from The X Factor in April 2016, choosing to focus on her music career; she was replaced by Osbourne.[96] She guest appeared in the show's 14th series in 2017 as Cowell's adviser during the Judges' houses stage.[97]  2018: Fifth studio album and The Greatest Dancer  In July 2018, Cheryl revealed that her fifth studio album was ""pretty much finished"". She worked on the record with Naughty Boy and her former bandmate Nicola Roberts with whom she co-wrote every song.[98] The album's first single, ""Love Made Me Do It"", was released on 9 November 2018, and marked the singer's first release with new record label 3 Beat.[99] Cheryl's comeback was met with intense media scrutiny, and the single failed to make an impact on the charts peaking at number 19 in the UK and number 32 in Ireland.[100][101][49] Her performance of ""Love Made Me Do It"" on the 15th series of The X Factor was widely criticised in the media, with viewers arguing that its ""overtly sexual nature"" was ""inappropriate"" for pre-watershed television.[102][103]  Cheryl's record label announced that they intend to release a series of singles before releasing a full-length album, with two singles being scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.[104] The singer will serve as a dance captain alongside Matthew Morrison and Oti Mabuse on the new BBC One dance competition The Greatest Dancer, which will premiere on 5 January 2019.[105][106]  Other ventures  As a member of Girls Aloud, Cheryl teamed with Eylure to release five sets of false eyelashes, each set designed by a different member of the group. A range of festival-themed lashes followed in 2010, while limited edition ""10th Anniversary"" lash was released in 2012.[107][108] Similarly, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, each member designed a charm bracelet for Pandora, available as either a complete bracelet or a ""starter"" bracelet.[109] From 2009 to 2018, Cheryl served as the UK spokesperson for L'Oréal.[110][111]  Cheryl's first official book, entitled Through My Eyes, was published on 30 September 2010 by Bantam Press.[112][113] Through My Eyes purports to show her in the recording studio, backstage on tour, behind-the-scenes at The X Factor, at photo shoots and at award ceremonies. She said the book is ""filled with pictures that capture those moments, [her] memories and the people [she's] closest to"".[114] She is the subject of several unauthorised biographies,[115][116][117] as well as books detailing her relationship with and divorce from Ashley Cole.[118][119][120] Her autobiography, Cheryl: My Story, was published on 11 October 2012.[121] The book's content was about her relationships with Simon Cowell and her ex-husband Cole.[122][123] It has sold 275,000 copies as of February 2013 , generating £2.5 million in sales. In August 2014, Cheryl released her debut fragrance, StormFlower.[124]  Philanthropy  In 2004, Girls Aloud released a cover of The Pretenders' ""I'll Stand by You"" as the official single for the BBC's charity telethon Children in Need.[125] In 2007, the group announced a joint release of Aerosmith and Run DMC's ""Walk This Way"" with Sugababes as the official single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief. The song was recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis' request.[126][127]  In March 2009, Cheryl climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. The climb, organised by Gary Barlow, was also undertaken by fellow Girls Aloud member Kimberley Walsh, as well as Alesha Dixon, Fearne Cotton, Denise Van Outen, Chris Moyles, Ben Shephard, Ronan Keating and Barlow himself.[128][129] Between 3 February and 23 March 2009, Cheryl, Walsh, Barlow, Moyles and Cotton also raised money for Comic Relief by providing the voice for the BT Speaking Clock.[130] All nine celebrities reached the summit of Kilimanjaro on Saturday, 7 March 2009.[131] Cheryl, along with Cotton, Van Outen and Shephard, reached the summit first at sunrise. The trek raised £3.5 million for the charity. In February 2011, Cheryl launched her own charitable foundation with The Prince's Trust following a meeting with The Trust's President, HRH Charles, Prince of Wales. The Cheryl Cole Foundation is meant to provide vital funds for The Trust in the North East, which was set up to help disadvantaged young people from Cheryl's region.[132] On 13 June 2011, she auctioned 20 dresses with ASOS to raise funds for the foundation.[133]  In September 2011, Cheryl became the latest ""Forces' sweetheart"" when she visited British soldiers in Afghanistan.[134] On 23 January 2015, Cheryl announced the launch of a second charity, once again alongside The Prince's Trust. The charity was named Cheryl's Trust, and was set up with the aim of raising £2 million to build a centre, which will support up to 4000 disadvantaged young people in her native city of Newcastle.[135] To raise these funds, Cheryl has thus far teamed up with Prizeo in March 2015, setting up a styling session competition,[136] and also launched a limited edition Belgian Chocolate Bar with Greggs in August 2015; 5p proceeds from each sale being donated towards the trust.[137] In November 2016, she became the ambassador of the charity ChildLine.[138]  Artistry and influences  Cheryl has a mezzo-soprano range.[139] She spoke about her vocal ability saying, ""I am very aware of my ability, I know I'm no Mariah Carey but I think the emotion in the song is what matters.""[140] 3 Words was influenced by her appreciation for dance music and crosses from contemporary R&B, dance pop, house and a more general pop sound. Messy Little Raindrops uses a more dance pop sound than her previous album. A Million Lights, her third studio album also incorporates R&B and dance.[141] She incorporated Dubstep into A Million Lights, MTV citing ""Girl in the Mirror"" as an example.[142]  Cheryl has named Britney Spears and Beyoncé as a few of her inspirations, performance and fashion-wise.[143][144] She spoke on the reason Beyoncé was an influence on her, saying, ""I love Beyoncé, I just think she is such a beautiful person inside and out, apart from what she does on the stage which is obviously incredible and aspiration. I just like her as a woman. She's empowering.""[145] She has cited Lisa ""Left Eye""' Lopes, a former member of American band TLC, as another influence saying, ""I wanted to be [Lopes] – I used to wear baggy jeans and Timberlands like a tomboy.""[146] Other influences she has cited are Rihanna, whom she described as ""a perfect pop star"",[147] and Mary J. Blige, saying, ""Mary's voice sounds so grown up and you can hear that she has experienced a lot in her life, her songs help me with every heartache.""[148] Cheryl has influenced other artists, including Selena Gomez.[149] The 2006 Lily Allen song ""Cheryl Tweedy"" was written about her.[150]  Accusations of lip-syncing  It has been widely reported that Cheryl lip-syncs during live performances. Whilst performing ""Fight for this Love"" in 2009 on The X Factor, media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that she denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance.[151] In 2010, during her second performance on The X Factor, in which she performed ""Promise This"", she ""showcased her vocal and dancing skills with an energetic, raunchy routine that earned a standing ovation from her fellow judges.""[152] Similar to her 2009 performance of ""Fight for This Love"" on The X Factor, the media speculated whether she lip-synced or not. An ITV spokesperson insisted that she did not mime, although the performance was pre-recorded.[153]  In June 2012, Cheryl performed ""Call My Name"" with live vocals on The Voice UK. It was reported that The Voice executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would ""provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast."" As the performance began, she swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly elaborated routine. Following the broadcast, she received mixed comments from viewers, with a few accusing the singer of lip-synching, while others, including pop artists Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, she addressed the negative comments, and said that ""if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment.""[154]  Public image  A wax figure of Cheryl at the museum Madame Tussauds in London  Cheryl has become a recognised and photographed style icon.[155][156][157] Fashion magazine British Vogue praised her style saying: ""Her wardrobe choices have become as successful as her singles – while filming for The X Factor, she had fashion fans watching her every sartorial move and was snapped wearing a string of fashion-forward outfits from Givenchy and Preen, to McQueen and Missoni.""[158] In both 2009 and 2010, she was named the best dressed woman by Glamour Magazine, after 14,000 votes from the magazine's readers were counted.[159] She has been photographed for the covers of British Vogue,[157] Elle and Harper's Bazaar. In March 2010, Cheryl was declared by research company Millward Brown as the second most powerful celebrity in Britain.[160]  Cheryl topped FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World in 2009 and 2010. She has won Glamour Women of the Year Awards for TV Personality and Best Dressed[161] and Style Network Award for Best Dressed Woman and Style Icon of the Decade.[155] In February 2009, she appeared on the cover of British Vogue. The media coverage of her appearance in the magazine boosted the magazine's circulation to 240,000, its best ever February figure.[162] She appeared on the November 2009 cover of the UK's Elle magazine. In October 2010, a wax statue of her was added to the gallery of Madame Tussauds London at a cost of approximately £150,000.[163]  Personal life  Cheryl began dating England and Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole in September 2004, announcing their engagement after he proposed in Dubai in June 2005.[164] The couple were married at a ceremony at Barnet, north west London on 15 July 2006.[165] They signed an exclusive deal with OK!, reportedly worth £1 million, regarding the rights of the photographs.[166] On 23 February 2010, Cheryl announced she was separating from Cole,[167][168] and on 26 May, she filed for divorce at London's High Court citing ""unreasonable behaviour"" from her estranged husband. The divorce papers state that Cole admitted being unfaithful to Cheryl with a number of other women.[169] She was granted a decree nisi on 3 September.[170] She continued to use her married name, but later began using the mononym Cheryl for her music releases.[171]  On 7 July 2014, Cheryl married French restaurateur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini after a three-month courtship.[172][173][174] Following their separation, Cheryl began dating singer Liam Payne in early 2016,[175][176] before being granted a decree nisi from Fernandez-Versini on 20 October 2016.[177] On 22 March 2017, she gave birth to her son with Payne.[178][179][180] Cheryl and Payne announced they had ended their relationship in July 2018.[181]  In December 2016, Cheryl appeared on the BBC One genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, during which she researched her maternal family.[182] Research shows that her paternal line is from Tyneside[183] and that there were a number of coal miners amongst Cheryl's forebears. When tracing further back, in one of the branches of her paternal line, researchers find that her ancestry includes several mariners.[184] The investigation into Cheryl's maternal line shows that her grandmother, Olga Ridley, was one of twin girls born to Edith Annie Burton, the housekeeper for a widower named Joseph Ridley who already had a number of children from his marriage.[185] Joseph Ridley had fought in World War I in the Durham Light Infantry as a Pioneer in France and, from an examination of the census, before the war he had been a Grocery Warehouseman.[185]  Assault conviction  On 11 January 2003, Cheryl was involved in an altercation with a nightclub toilet attendant, Sophie Amogbokpa, and subsequently charged with racially aggravated assault over the incident.[186][187] At her trial on 20 October she was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm but cleared of the racially aggravated assault charge,[188] and sentenced to 120 hours of community service. She was ordered to pay her victim £500 in compensation, as well as £3,000 prosecution costs. Judge Richard Howard said, ""This was an unpleasant piece of drunken violence which caused Sophie Amogbokpa pain and suffering.""[188]  Filmography  Discography  Tours  Solo tours  As solo supporting act  Awards and nominations  See also"	0
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Yesterday, multiple outlets reported that Brad Pitt is under investigation for child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services after an incident that occurred on his family’s private plane last Wednesday. More details have emerged about the incident that reportedly caused Angelina Jolie to file for divorce and request full custody of the couple’s six children. Us Weekly is reporting that at least part of the alleged fight was caught on film, and TMZ and People are reporting that the fight involved Pitt and Jolie’s 15-year-old son, Maddox.  According to TMZ, “the details of precisely what happened” are “murky,” but the anonymous person who reported Pitt to the DCFS alleged that Pitt “attacked” Maddox on the family’s flight home from Nice, France. From TMZ:  Here’s what’s alleged – shortly after the plane took off, Brad and Angelina began arguing and Maddox jumped up to verbally defend his mom. We’re told Brad then lunged at the boy and Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband. Brad connected in some fashion with his son.  People, which has presented Pitt’s side of the divorce story throughout the week, reports that Pitt “did not hit” Maddox during the incident. A source close to Pitt provided People with the following account:  Pitt “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” says the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.”    The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.”    A source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are “a combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth – that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it – and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.”  Lainey Lui of Lainey Gossip points out that, at some point last night, People removed the following sentence from the report: “The Pitt source adds that the star ‘was not black-out drunk’ and that ‘he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.’”  TMZ notes that Pitt’s sources and Jolie’s sources do not agree on whether or not Pitt was drunk during the incident, so that point remains unclear. TMZ reported yesterday that sometime after the incident, the plane landed in Minnesota to refuel, and “that’s when eyewitnesses say Brad was ‘out of control’ on the tarmac and even tried to leave in a fuel truck.”  Pitt has yet to release an official statement regarding the allegations. Us Weekly reports that, on the video of the incident, Pitt can be seen “looking drunk” and “yelling.” Us Weekly’s source claims, however, that “nothing physical” happens on the tape.  According to TMZ, Pitt still plans to fight for joint custody of his children.  We will update this post as more information becomes available.	1

"A MAN marrying a stranger on a reality TV show was so disappointed by his new wife's appearance that he muttered ""oh s**t"" the moment she appeared at the top of the aisle.  Aussie Sean D, 38, was saying I Do to a total stranger on Married At First Sight, a programme that sees total strangers meeting at the altar after being paired up for life by a team of scientists and psychologists.  Channel 9 6 Sean D muttered ""oh s**t"" when he first locked eyes on his new bride  But while single mum Jo, 39, was thrilled with her new hubby - later exclaiming ""Jackpot! I've won the lotto!"" - he had a face like thunder for the entire ceremony and the reception.  Things even took a further dive when after kissing his new missus, he wiped her lipstick off his mouth and said ""gross"".  Speaking to The Fix, Sean shared the criteria he had given producers for his dream partner.  He said: ""Someone who’s funny. Someone’s who loyal. Someone who wants to have good fun. Having someone to go and have fun with and do different things and learn different things. And someone who's trustworthy.""  Channel 9 6 He was unable to hide his disappointment, although he was matched with someone who was 100% his type on paper  Channel 9 6 Jo was delighted to see her hunky new husband and said she felt like she had won the lottery  But despite Jo ticking all the boxes, he simply didn't fancy her.  Sadly for Jo, she really did think she had struck gold with her mystery man.  At the wedding she said: ""He's got kind eyes. He seems genuine. I fancy him.  ""This could work. My expectations have been met and then some. To infinity and beyond... Sean D and Jo sitting in a tree.  Channel 9 6 Jo couldn't stop talking about how good looking her new man was  ""My expectations have been met, and then some. To infinity and beyond. Winning! Jackpot! I've won the lotto!  ""The experts have been spot on! He is for me. He couldn't be any more perfect.""  But Sean felt very differently, which made for awkward viewing for people at home.  He said, ""Um, she's probably not what I imagined, no.  Channel 9 6 Later Sean looked despondently at the table as Jo stared at him adoringly  ""There's not like a massive spark straight away, but I'm sure she's feeling the same way.""  People tuned in at home were on the edge of their seats as the mismatched pair continued to totally misread one another's body language and reactions to each other.  All I really wanna watch is Jo & that sad sack Sean #MAFS — DeluxeStormBorn™ (@deluxe_tm) January 31, 2018  However, Sean has since explained his frosty reaction to likeable Jo - it's all because of his exercise addict ex-girlfriend who he's still a bit hung up on.  He said that after she got addicted to exercise, their 10 year relationship ended and he was stuck caring for their plethora of pets including llamas and cats - and he is still traumatised and tired.  Sean said: ""We had a five-acre property together, and she ran out of time for me and the animals.  Channel 9 6 Sean later described kissing his wife as ""gross""  ""It was really hard because I had to take responsibility of the farm. I got all the animals. When we broke up, we had nine dogs, two alpacas, and two horses.  ""It was difficult breaking up, it wasn't like either of us did anything wrong - there was no cheating or anything like that.  ""She became a fitness freak but was just crazy. We slowly drifted apart and that was it, we were done.""

After 27 years of making jaunty cartoon music for The Simpsons, longtime composer Alf Clausen has been fired from the show. That’s according to Variety, which reports that Simpsons producer Richard Sakai recently called Clausen and told him that the show is looking for “a different kind of music,” so someone different will be scoring the series from now on. Considering how omnipresent and iconic Clausen’s score has been, though, it seems likely that any “different kind of music” will be a huge change for The Simpsons.  Variety expects that this decision was because of money, which has been a regular issue for the show over the last few years, with the story saying that the costs for scoring the series “routinely run into the millions of dollars per year” because of Matt Groening’s insistence that it use a 35-piece orchestra for every episode. It’s unclear which cheap scab will be hired to replace Clausen, but Danny Elfman’s famous Simpsons theme will most likely stick around.  Advertisement  Clausen won two Emmy awards for his work on The Simpsons, and he has been nominated 21 times on top of that. His final episode was the season 28 finale, which aired earlier this year.	0

They explained they have ""neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever"" in the production of the season, before adding that it ""should only be considered as a work of fiction.""[58] Executive producer Ryan Murphy answered that the series was ""not a work of fiction"" as it is based on a non-fiction book, Maureen Orth's Vulgar Favors, and that the production team and FX stand by the author and her work. Comparing it to The People v. O. J. Simpson, Murphy added that the season is ""a work of non-fiction obviously with docudrama elements,"" and not a documentary.[58] Following this answer, the Versace family released a second statement, still slamming the series as ""a work of fiction"" because ""the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation."" They also heavily criticized Orth's work, calling it an ""effort to create a sensational story"" with ""second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions."" They gave the example of Gianni Versace's medical condition, as Orth claims that Versace was HIV positive at the time of his death.[59]  Antonio D'Amico also criticized the series, deeming some scenes as ""ridiculous"" and insisting that ""so much has been fictionalised"". He also revealed that he does not plan to watch it, but that he would have been happy if Ricky Martin, who plays his role, got in contact to get some insight into his relationship with Versace.[60]  According to Ryan Murphy, Donatella Versace was very supportive that Penélope Cruz played her role. As Cruz and Versace are friends, Murphy explained that, when he offered her the role, Cruz asked the permission of Versace before agreeing to do it.

In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's ""no ring, no bring"" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the ""no ring no bring"" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life."	0
T.I. has a few words for Rob Kardashian after the reality star claimed the rapper had a threesome with his ex-fiancée Blac Chyna and T.I.’s ex-wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris back in the day.  TMZ caught up with the 36-year-old rapper at Los Angeles International Airport over the weekend.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Don’t tell women’s business. That’s bad. That’s very, very bad. Poor character. Flawed, you know what I mean?” T.I. — born Clifford Harris — said. “If a woman trusted you and confided in you with secrets and stuff like that, you don’t ever let that — you don’t do that. Secrets are sacred, you don’t do that. That’s a whole other level of f—boy s— right there.”  T.I. added that he thinks Kardashian, 30, is going to have a hard time hooking up with women after exposing Chyna, 29, in a series of now-deleted rants on social media.  One post called out T.I. after the rapper criticized Kardashian for taking his feud with Chyna public.  “Why bring ya business to IG tho? Look, You got worked bro….but at least keep it to yourself, you letting the world know you a duck. I mean a BIG DUCK, a mighty duck, Ronald McDonald the Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Howard the Druck, Huey Dewy & Lewie… save the #DuckTales Just hold this L, kiss ya kid & cut ya losses& move on… u got no moves bro,” T.I. said, according to a Instagram comment captured by Baller Alert.  “Since TI wanna chime in on business that don’t concern him let’s talk about the threesome you had with Chyna and your baby mama Tiny,” Kardashian replied. “Don’t speak on my daughter when u having threesomes with young Chy and Tiny ::: and I put that on my daughters life since u wanna speak on my daughter,,, damn shame. Chyna told me everything about your threesomes with you and her and Tiny. U got no moves bro ;;; Correction ::: TI paid Chyna to have sex with Tiny and him.”  RELATED VIDEO: Rob Kardashian Puts ‘Cheating’ Ex Blac Chyna on Blast with Explicit Photos  After Kardashian put Chyna on blast, including posting explicit photos of her, high-powered civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom announced Friday that she is now legally representing Chyna and is seeking restraining orders against Kardashian on behalf of her client.  “I represent Blac Chyna,” Bloom tweeted Friday. “I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we’ll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him. More to come.”  Chyna’s rep and Bloom’s co-counsel Walter Mosley also told PEOPLE, “Lisa Bloom is the best in the business and has the right sensitivities and skill set to handle this delicate and complex matter. She’s a warrior for women’s rights and that’s the type of lawyer we need right now.”	0

Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.(Photo courtesy of Shelby Bell.)Share this: TwitterFacebookGoogle	1

The next 48 hours leading up to the cast announcement are likely to be pretty hectic, so I thought I better get this posted sooner rather than later. Here’s the list of all the cast rumors we’ve heard/reported on for season 24 – as always, they’re divided into categories. Legitimate possibilities are rumors that we think have some validity, based on who is reporting them; long shots are rumors from a source that we don’t necessarily trust, but it’s possible they could be valid; pure randomness is general observations/weird stuff we’ve noticed that may or may not indicate anything, but is interesting nonetheless; wannabes/campaigners are celebs that have expressed interest in doing the show, but we have no reason to believe they’ve actually been asked to do the show; and the definite “no’s” are celebs that have specifically said they won’t do the show.  If anything new crops up between now & the announcement, I’ll do my best to update…but no guarantees. Tomorrow is Fat Tuesday, and I’ve got hella king cakes to get ready 😎  Legitimate possibilities :  Normani Kordei  Simone Biles  Mr. T  Chris Kattan  Erika Jayne  Nancy Kerrigan  Nick Viall  Heather Morris  Charo  Bonner Bolton  Rashad Jennings  Longshots :  Someone from Pretty Little Liars/Ashley Benson  Someone from Property Brothers/Jonathan Scott  Someone from Storage Wars/Barry Weiss  Rachel Lindsay  Russell Brand  Usher  Billy Bush  Pure Randomness :  Shemar Moore  Victor Cruz  Gracie Gold  Ricky Schroeder  Jose Medina  Wannabes/Campaigners :  Mary Lou Retton  Stassi Schroeder  Dina Parise  The Definite No’s :  Hugh Grant  Ashlee Simpson  Michelle Obama  Hillary Clinton	1

ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam.

"Chad Robert Kroeger (),[5] (born November 15, 1974), is a Canadian musician and producer, best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist for the Canadian rock band Nickelback.[6] In addition to his work with Nickelback, Kroeger has been involved with a variety of collaborations, appearing as a guest musician in several songs and has contributed in both production and songwriting. He has co-written several songs for other artists and films.  Early life  Kroeger was born Chad Robert Turton in Hanna, Alberta on November 15, 1974.[7][8] His maternal grandfather was Alberta MLA Henry Kroeger, who was born in Moscow, Russia, to a Mennonite family of German descent.[9][10] After his father left the family when he was two,[9] he started going by his mother's maiden name of Kroeger. He learned to play the guitar at age 13.  Career  Nickelback  In the early 1990s, Kroeger was part of a grunge cover band, The Village Idiots, with his cousin Brandon Kroeger and future Nickelback members bassist Mike Kroeger (his brother) and singer Ryan Peake. In 1995, Kroeger, Peake, Mike Kroeger, and then drummer Brandon Kroeger[11], formed the band Nickelback. Kroeger has continued to record and tour with this successful band for more than 20 years.  The Suits XL  In 2001, Kroeger, with the help of lawyer Jonathan Simkin, founded the band The Suits XL.[12] Band members included Sam Loubier-Demers and Yohann Gosselin on vocals and guitars, drummer Patrick Paquet, keyboardist Felix-Antoine Berube and singer Oliver Roy de Belleval. The next year, he co-founded the Vancouver, British Columbia-based 604 Records.[7] Later, in 2006, The Suits XL released an album through this label.[12][13] The next year the band was nominated for a Canadian Indie Award.[14]  Collaborations  Kroeger produced music for the bands Default, Theory of a Deadman, and Bo Bice.[citation needed]  Kroeger, along with Saliva vocalist Josey Scott, Theory of a Deadman lead vocalist (serving as guitarist for this track) Tyler Connolly and Our Lady Peace drummer Jeremy Taggart, performed the theme song titled ""Hero"" for the hit movie Spider-Man in 2002. Also in 2002, Kroeger wrote and sang on ""Why Don't You & I"" for Santana's Shaman. However, when Arista decided to release the song as a single in Summer 2003, Kroeger's label, Roadrunner, refused permission, citing concerns that Kroeger appearing on a ""high-profile single"" would compromise the excitement over Nickelback's fall 2003 release The Long Road. Kroeger recommended The Calling's Alex Band, another Arista artist, as a replacement for re-recording the single.[15][16]  In 2003, Kroeger won an International Achievement Award for the song ""Hero"" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[17]  In 2007, Chad Kroeger worked with Santana for a second time, when he co-wrote and recorded guitar and vocals parts for a new song meant to appear on the compilation album Ultimate Santana. The track is called ""Into the Night"" and was released as a single on October 2, 2007. The album Ultimate Santana was released in October. Besides working with Santana, Kroeger also recorded with Travis Tritt on his album The Storm, where Tritt did a cover of Nickelback's ""Should've Listened"" track from The Long Road.  Kroeger also wrote and played guitar on Bo Bice's You're Everything.  Chad Kroeger, Eric Dill, Rune Westberg and Chris Daughtry wrote the debut single of Daughtry's new album.[18] The single, titled ""No Surprise"", was debuted on American Idol Wednesday, May 6, 2009.

"In his upcoming book 'The Kardashians: An American Drama,' Jerry Oppenheimer takes a closer look at two of the longest-circulating rumors about the Kardashian family.  First is the claim that Kris Jenner had an affair with her husband's best friend Orenthal James Simpson, which appears to have first emerged after Kris split with fiancé Cesar Sanudo.  The second concerns the paternity of Kris' third child Khloe, who multiple sources close to the family believe was not the daughter of Robert.  That first claim still lacks any definitive proof or solid evidence the book reveals, while Oppenheimer speaks to a number of people who lend credence to the second claim by recounting conversations they had with Robert.  This latest work by the New York Times bestselling author will be released by St. Martin's press this September.  Scandal: Cesar Sanudo believed that his fiancee Kris Jenner was sleeping with both Robert Kardashian and OJ Simpson when they were engaged (Simpson and the Kardashians above in the mid-80s)  Sanudo's daughter Amber Carillo says in the book that although her father was the son of Mexican immigrants, he had some shocking opinions about interracial dating.  Origin: Sanudo (above with Kris) shared his thoughts with his daughter  She recounts one time when her father had been watching an episode of the family's E! reality series 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' and said to her: 'Why would Kris let her kids date black men.'  Carillo says she dismissed his remark by saying 'this is not the 1920s' and urging her father to 'get the fifties and sixties mentality about race out of your head.’  She goes on to reveal however that part of his anger likely stemmed from his belief that Kris had been cheating on him with both Robert and OJ.  'That racial mixing angered him. And that’s why he used to say Kris was sexually involved with OJ,' explains Carillo.  'How real that is, and did my dad witness it, I don’t think so. He said he was pretty sure that she was seeing OJ along with Kardashian, that she had an affair with OJ too.'  She later adds: 'He thought more or less that Kris would be with OJ and I had to correct him.'  OJ was a major part of Kris' life once she met Robert, as he lived with the pair and Robert's brother Tom at their home in Beverly Hills whenever he and first wife Marguerite were on the outs - which was very often in those final years of their marriage.  He was also with Robert when he first picked Kris up at the airport in Los Angeles, and by Robert's side when he flew to New York to take his future wife back after his relationship with Priscilla Presley came to an end.  On that trip the three stayed at The Plaza and went to Studio 54 before jetting off to Montreal where Simpson was providing commentary for ABC Sports at the 1976 Summer Games.  It was at those Olympics that Bruce Jenner shot to fame with his win in the decathlon.  More allegations: Robert's pastor Kenn Gulliksen and best friends Joni Midigal and Larry Kraines all say that Robert told them privately that he was not Khloe's father (Khloe and Robert above in the late 1980s)  Family affair: His love for Khloe was the same as it was for his two oldest daughters regardless of this fact all three claim, and he refused to ever take a DNA test (family above in the late 1980s)  Fila-ing it: Robert and Kris welcomed their first child, daughter Kourtney, just nine months after their wedding (above in 1979)  Two years later, Kris and Robert walked down the aisle, with their first daughter Kourtney coming just nine months after the pair said 'I do.'  Her birth in 1979 was followed by the arrival of little sister Kim just 18 months later, quickly filling out the family.  Then, a little less than four years after Kim was born, Kris gave birth to a daughter Khloe.  Much has been said over the years about Khloe's paternity, with Kris and her daughters all summarily shooting down any stories or reports claiming that Robert was not the father of Kris' third child.  Robert never spoke publicly about the matter, though in at least one legal filing in the aftermath of his separation from Kris years later was reported to have stated that he had 'four biological children.'  Kris and Khloe both say Robert was her father  That is not the story he told however to three of the people who were closest to him back at that time - his pastor Kenn Gulliksen, lifelong friend Joni Midigal and close confident and high school pal Larry Kraines.  'Kris and Robert had four children. Well they had three kids and somebody else’s kid,' reveals Gulliksen.  'Bob never asked my counsel but I simply heard from him that Khloe wasn’t his biological daughter.  He then states: 'He gave me no names of who the father was. But I certainly know it wasn’t OJ.'  Robert did however still love Khloe as if she were a daughter according to Gulliken.  ‘It was my strong impression from him that he loved Khloe very much but he said it in a way that implied she’s not my blood daughter, meaning his biological daughter,' he tells Oppenheimer.  ‘My understanding from him was that he and Kris hadn’t had sex during the period of time they would have had to had sex when Khloe was conceived.’  Kris has said many times in the past and wrote in her 2011 memoir that Khloe was conceived in Italy.  Kraines, who was actually at the hospital when Khloe was born, says that Robert told him soon after the delivery: 'It's all bulls***.'  Mystery man: Some have alleged that Khloe's real father is Kris' former hairdresser Alex Roldan (above in 2012)  Here comes the bride: New York Times-bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer is telling all about Kris Jenner in 'Kardashians: An American Drama,' which is out in September (Kris and Robert Kardashain with Pastor Kenn Gulliksen at their 1978 wedding)  Despite these private conversation with friends in which he expressed that Khloe was almost certainly not his biological child, Robert refused to take the next step because of the kind of person that he was according to Midigal.  ‘He made a decision that no matter who Khloe’s father was that Robert was going to love her as his own, and it was all done. That was his decision. It was the honorable way of doing it, and the respectful way,’ says Midigal.  'He didn’t want a DNA test done, he didn’t want to find out anything. He told me, ""I love Khloe. She’s wonderful. She’s mine, period.” But he knew she wasn’t his. His confirmation to me was, ""She’s mine and I don’t care who the father is.'""  New York Times-bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer is telling all about Kris Jenner in 'Kardashians: An American Drama,' which is out in September  Among those whose names have been floating around as possibly being Khloe's father are Simpson and Kris' hairdresser Alex Roldan.  Kylie Jenner made light of the claims that Roldan was Khloe's father back in 2012 by tweeting a photo of Khloe and the hairdresser, writing: ''First official photo of my sister and her dad! Like father like daughter!'  Khloe meanwhile addressed the rumor in March of last year on an episode of her now cancelled show 'Kocktails With Khloe.'  It came up during a conversation about the dark side of fame, with Khloe expressing her distaste for claims that had been made by her father's widow Ellen Pearson.  'I think the thing that most became overwhelming was when, like, the stuff happened with one of my dad’s wives,' said Khloe.  'She wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I’m not his daughter and that he confided in her and blah-say-blah.'  She went on to say: 'I was like, ""Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f***ing want. Do not talk about my dad.… He’s not here!”'  It is all happening once again however, only this time with three people and not just one claiming Robert confided in them about the fact that Khloe was not biologically a Kardashian."	1

"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also"	1

EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING, DailyEdge.ie rounds up the best of the day’s celebrity dirt from the top to the very bottom.  Source: SIPA USA/PA Images  Last week we learned that Tyga was struggling to come to terms with the fact that his ex-girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, was exceptionally close to securing billionaire status.  Apparently, the rapper felt that he should have a slice of the high life since he was in a relationship with Kylie when she launched her first lip kit back in 2015.  Source: Piovanotto Marco/PA Images  And this week, he’s stressed over the GQ photoshoot she did with her current partner and the father of her child, Travis Scott.  Speaking to HollywoodLife, a source close to Tyga spilled the deets.  Tyga feels crushed over another one of Kylie’s magazine covers. He feels heartbroken over her latest GQ cover with Travis.  🖤 A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jul 17, 2018 at 11:34am PDT  He’s in a right heap over it, apparently.  Tyga misses Kylie and feels like that should have been him making gorgeous babies with Kylie, doing interviews and posing with her for photo shoots and magazine covers. Last week’s Forbes cover was like a punch in the gut and now this GQ cover with Travis is only making missing Kylie worse and more painful.  According to sources, the rapper couldn’t even bring himself to open the pages of the publication.  He doesn’t like seeing her with Travis’s arms wrapped around her and he does not want to read the interview either.  Sorry to hear that, Tyga.

I have had bouts of situational depression and my heart was broken last year because, unknowingly, I put so much validity in the reaction of the public.  About last night ♏️ 💜#americanidolfinale A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on May 22, 2018 at 1:22pm PDT  The 33-year-old admitted that she was left heartbroken by the response to the album, which saw the release of Chained to the Rhythm and Swish Swish.  The public didn’t react in the way I had expected to … which broke my heart.  The singer reveals she sought help from the Hoffman Institute, a California-based personal growth retreat, after seeing how much her friends gained from time spent there.  For years, my friends would go and come back completely rejuvenated, and I wanted to go, too. I was ready to let go of anything that was holding me back from being my ultimate self. Fair play, Perry.

Source: Doug Peters/PA Images  Using Love Island as an example, Calum, who appeared on Lorraine today, began by saying he understands why the line is often blurred.  I know it can be light hearted and fun because realistically Love Island is a fun show.  Calum, who won Celebrity Love Island in 2006, spoke of his own experience, while acknowledging that not everyone is robust enough to cope with the court of public opinion in the aftermath.  You go out there and there’re awkward love moments and it’s all quite fun but you have to think about if people are getting trolled and nasty things are being said and they don’t know how to cope with that, that can mess them up.  Source: Hugh Macknight/PA Images  Referring to the late Sophie Gradon, who appeared on Love Island in 2016, and died last month, Calum said:  Poor Sophie, she was a friend of mine and to think she was struggling on the inside because of what people might have said or how she was being treated – it’s a horrible thought and that can happen to anybody.  The 37-year-old acknowledges that trolling on social media is almost unavoidable, but is keen to raise awareness of the implications of certain online behaviour.  I know there are memes out there and it can be quite funny and we all have a laugh, but can you imagine if somebody isn’t confident or somebody lacks self belief and they start seeing all these horrible things written about them.  Definitely something to think about.

Britney Spears' spending habits have been revealed in new court documents related to her conservatorship.  The pop star - who earned $16 million last year - spent a total of $10,956,873.91 in 2016 with most of her money going on massages and clothes, according to TMZ.  Legal documents show the mother-of-two dropped a whopping $122,613 on massages - no doubt because of her grueling workouts and back-to-back shows in Las Vegas - as well as manicures and other personal grooming.  Shopping: Britney Spears spent nearly $11 million in 2016 according to legal documents seen by TMZ including a whopping $122,613 on massages and personal grooming  She also spent $69,668 on wardrobe and $24,392 for hair and makeup.  Another $29,852 goes to caring for her pet pooches - slightly less that last year's total of $37,000.  Britney also made numerous trips to stores like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Pottery Barn, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons and Target, spending a few hundred dollars at a time.  The songstress is often spotted out in her local Los Angeles neighborhood picking up groceries or home-wares.  TMZ also revealed the Circus hitmaker has assets totaling $55,745,288.  Soothing those muscles: It's no wonder the songstress spends so much on massages thanks to her grueling workouts and Las Vegas show schedule  Another $29,852 goes to caring for her pet pooches - slightly less that last year's total of $37,000  Britney - pictured with boyfriend Sam Asghari also spent $69,668 on wardrobe and $24,392 for hair and makeup in 2016  The number is up by $5 million from 2015 and doesn't include millions more in various trusts.  Britney still cannot make legal or financial decisions without the approval of her father Jamie Spears and his lawyer Andrew Wallet.  Jamie, 65, has been running her business and personal affairs for eight years.  Britney pays him $130,000 per year to act as conservator of her estate in an arrangement that has no end in sight, the New York Times reported last year.  Britney also made numerous trips to stores like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Pottery Barn, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons and Target, spending a few hundred dollars at a time  Jamie was made legal custodian of Britney in 2008 after her dramatic meltdown, and is responsible for her physical well-being, custody arrangements, managing her money and overseeing her music career.  All of Britney's purchases, no matter how small, are tracked and submitted in court documents under the arrangement.  After four years, Britney will wrap up her Piece Of Me! residency in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve.

Days after being absent from his annual duty as moderator for The Walking Dead panel at Comic-Con, Chris Hardwick has been given the green light by AMC to return to the air after allegations of sexual assault and emotional abuse by an ex-girlfriend.  “Following a comprehensive assessment by AMC, working with Ivy Kagan Bierman of the firm Loeb & Loeb, who has considerable experience in this area, Chris Hardwick will return to AMC as the host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick,” the cabler said in a statement Wednesday. “We take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning Chris to work is the appropriate step.”  With AMC taking the stage at TCA on July 29, the timing is obviously somewhat directed to clearing the slate for the cabler so its annual Hall H session would not turn into a one-issue discussion.  The plan is for Hardwick to be back on Talking Dead for its August 12 premiere, right after the Season 4 mid-season debut of Fear The Walking Dead.  Frequent Talking Dead participant and Hardwick’s SDCC panel replacement Yvette Nicole Brown will still front the previously set TWD Season 9 preview special August 5 and appear as a guest on Talking Dead the following week. No return date for Season 2 of Talking With Chris Hardwick has been set yet due to scheduling issues, I hear. All episodes are already in the can.  Deadline revealed July 4 that Community actor Brown would be taking over Hardwick’s SDCC duties. A week later, AMC confirmed that Brown, who called Hardwick a “friend” in a Independence Day tweet, would be fronting the Season 9 preview special for the zombie-apocalypse series and the series’ much watched aftershow as an “interim host” — only half of which she is doing now.  Reps for Hardwick did not respond to request for comment on the move by AMC.  After accusations by Hardwick’s ex Chloe Dykstra surfaced on June 15, AMC a day later pulled the Season 2 June 17 premiere of Talking with Chris Hardwick. At the time, the calber also said that The Wall host would not participate in Talking Dead for the immediate future, nor for the TWD or Doctor Who panels at SDCC he had already been set for.  On June 15, Hardwick strongly denied the allegations from Dykstra, which included sexual and emotional abuse.  “These are very serious allegations and not to be taken lightly which is why I’ve taken the day to consider how to respond,” said Hardwick that night. “I was heartbroken to read Chloe’s post. Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.”  The adamant response from the longtime AMC host and Nerdist founder followed the detailed and harrowing first-person account that Dykstra wrote for Medium. The post never called out Hardwick by name, but the post by TV personality and Syfy’s Heroes of Cosplay castmember made it pretty clear whom she was talking about. With the duo having played out so much of their time together in the public and digital spotlight, there were details about the “mildly successful podcaster” who became “a powerhouse CEO of his own company, their age difference and more. The details were indicative of the now married Hardwick, who announced online his break-up with Dykstra in 2014.  Declaring on June 16 that they were assessing the allegations, NBC has not announced whether Hardwick will be back for more of The Wall later this year.	0

Angelina Jolie decided she was done with Brad Pitt in September 2016 when she filed for divorce, and hasn’t given any indication since then that she wants him back. However, an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY Angie also doesn’t want to see him with someone new.  “Even though [Angelina Jolie] wanted the split, she’s terrified Brad [Pitt] will move on and find love with someone new,” an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “It’s one of those she can’t live with him, and she can’t live without him, things. Brad and Angie had scorching chemistry and she just can’t handle seeing him with another woman. She definitely gets very jealous.”  Oh, we are totally aware of the kind of chemistry that Brad, 53, and Angelina, 41, had when they were still together. Their 10-year romance was fiery from the very beginning — back when they were filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, 48.  The kind of passion they had on screen had fans wondering if they had a thing for each other. Those suspicions were confirmed when Brad left Jen for Angie and they embarked on a new life together in which they would have several children (both adopted and biological) and eventually get married.  But Angie decided to end that marriage in September 2016 and the two have since been stuck in the middle of a complex divorce and custody battle. With everything that is going on we can see why Angie has complicated feelings when it comes to Brad dating again.  “She’s definitely keeps an eye on him and what he’s up to,” the source added. “Besides just not wanting to see him with someone else, Angie really doesn’t want to see another woman come into the kids lives. That would really freak her out.”  “For now she doesn’t really have much to worry about, as Brad is focused on the kids, his health, art and his career,” the insider said. “Other than that he just doesn’t have interest in another relationship.” Well, at least we know that she has some time to get used to the idea before he starts bringing women home to meet the kids!  HollywoodLifers, when do you think that Brad will find someone new? Do you think he will ever want to date again? Give us all your thoughts below!	1
ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1

After receiving disappointingly low scores from the judges during the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Ashley Wagner spoke out against the judges who stood between her and her dream of competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics.  After Friday’s competition — in which Wagner finished in fourth place — she revealed that was was “absolutely furious,” according to The Salt Lake Tribune.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 26-year-old Olympic bronze medalist added that “For me to put out two programs that I did at this competition as solid as I skated and to get those scores, I am furious, and I think deservedly so.”  Matthew Stockman/Getty Images  “I honestly think that at the end of the day, this is how I feel, and I feel like I need to stick up for myself, and I think that I delivered when I really needed to,” Wagner continued. “I think all these girls delivered when they needed to, but I want to be on that Olympic team and I’m really mad that I’m in this position again.”  Although Wagner was given the chance to represent the United States at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi after finishing in fourth in the U.S. Championships that year — edging out skater Mirai Nagasu who had finished in third place — on Saturday it was announced that Wagner would not be so lucky again. She was named as Team USA’s first alternate.  RELATED VIDEO: Even Olympians Have Bad Days! Figure Skater Ashley Wagner Shares What Keeps Her Going  Wagner previously opened up to PEOPLE about what it would have meant to get to compete in the Pyeongchang Olympics as a 26-year-old woman.  “To be a 26-year-old woman on the ice is an achievement in this sport because you’re working against a lot of different things,” she said. “If I got to Pyeongchang, I will be the oldest U.S. female figure skating athlete since 1924 or something like that — so I think it really goes to show that my longevity is something that’s very, very rare. And I’m really proud of that, and it’s because I’m so freakin’ stubborn.”  And while the road to Pyeongchang was not always easy for the three-time national champion, Wagner never lost sight of her goal.  “I think that if anyone tells you that they’ve been that hungry every single day of their career, they’re not being honest,” Wagner added. “You have days where you don’t want to train. I mean, I’ve been skating for 22 years — this absolutely gets old. But it’s one of those things where I set a goal when I was 6, 7 years old and I owe it to that little girl … to see this through.”  Ashley Wagner Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  The 2018 Games, beginning on Feb. 8, would have been Wagner’s third Olympic experience. In addition to receiving a bronze medal at the team-skating event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, she was a first alternate at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  The three women who were chosen to compete for the United States in Pyeongchang next month are Bradie Tennell, Karen Chen and Mirai Nagasu — the figure skater who Wagner beat out for a spot on the Olympic team in 2014.	0

Have you been hearing a lot about facial mists, setting sprays, and primer sprays lately and wondering what all the hype is about? Many women swear by spritzing their face with these types of products for a variety of reasons. Depending on which one you use, a facial mist, setting spray, or primer spray can help to perk up tired-looking skin, set your makeup, prep your skin for face makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration—which can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. But generally, all skin types can reap the benefits of a facial mist or setting spray. Ready to add one to your beauty routine? Keep reading to find out more about what they can do!  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACE SPRAYS AND MISTS?  Wondering what exactly the difference is between all of the types of face sprays we’ve mentioned already? Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk—refreshing facial mists are about to become your skin’s new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It’s time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they’re meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you’re looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!  Now you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren’t sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We’re breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.  ADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  A facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn’t sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.  Even if you’re feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry. A quick misting can give dry skin the extra boost it needs. This is particularly helpful during those cold, winter months when skin tends to get dull.  HOW TO USE A FACIAL MIST  We promise: It’s so easy! Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn’t interfere with your makeup). That’s it!  ADD A SETTING SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  When you want to rock a “just applied” makeup look all day and night, a setting spray is the way to go! When your contour and your smoky eye are on point, we understand that you’ll try just about anything to maintain your look from desk to drinks. Instead of constantly reapplying or worrying about any makeup faux pas, make locking in your look with a setting spray as the last step in your makeup routine. A setting spray will increase your makeup’s lifespan—which means you can dance the night away without the fear of sweating your foundation off.  A setting spray can also come through in the clutch if you have oily skin. If you do have oily skin, chances are you’re layering on powder makeup to help your makeup stay put throughout the day. A setting spray can help soften the look of all the products you’ve previously applied—giving you the seamless look you’re after! Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.  HOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY  Once you’re done applying all of your makeup—foundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it—lightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup and keep your look lasting even longer.  ADD A PRIMER SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  Primer sprays are another type of facial spray worthy of adding to your beauty regimen—and they’ve been getting more attention as of late. A primer spray is ideal for those with oily skin. It preps your skin for your makeup application, allowing it to last longer and go on smoother! It’s also a must if you have a big occasion coming up (cough, cough—the holidays) where your makeup fading throughout the night is simply not an option.  HOW TO USE A PRIMER SPRAY  Using a primer spray is as easy as saying your ABC’s and counting to 1, 2, 3! Simply spritz it onto bare skin before applying your makeup—after going through your full skin care routine—and you’re good to go!  OUR BEST FACIAL SPRAYS  Now that you know about the different types of facial sprays, it’s time to add one to your routine!

"Melanie Martinez Rape Accuser Says 'I Had This Sick Need to Protect Her': Report  Former Dresses singer Timothy Heller says that a month before she accused former The Voice star Melanie Martinez of rape, Martinez attempted to get in touch with her after a long period of silence.  In an interview with Newsweek, Heller claims that after she tweeted last month asking ""what if I have my own story of abuse but I'm scared to ruin the persons life and I still love them in a fucked up way and the public really loves them and most probably wouldn't believe me,"" Martinez tried to contact her 20 minutes later, after the two hadn't spoke in more than a year.  On Monday (Dec. 4), Heller posted a lengthy tweet in which she described a night during which she ""repeatedly said no"" to advances from her ""best friend"" Martinez, claiming she kept the secret for years and alleging that Martinez performed oral sex on her and used a sex toy without her consent. Martinez adamantly denied the claims, saying she was ""horrified and saddened"" by them and that ""she never said no to what we chose to do together.""  After Heller's original tweet, she told the magazine, ""I started sobbing when I saw [Melanie] was calling me, and I blocked her."" She also claimed that Martinez attempted to call Heller's boyfriend and texted him several times seeking to get in touch with Heller, whom Martinez said she had recently dreamed about. ""Her fans see her as this angel who understands them,"" Heller told Newsweek. ""So I assumed no one was going to take me seriously if I explained what she did. I've been reading all the #metoo stories, and though I'm obviously in support of the people coming forward, I wasn't sure if my story of being assaulted fit.""  It is one of the rare allegations of sexual assault by a woman in the midst of the torrent of stories surrounding prominent men in entertainment, business, politics and sports assaulting or harassing women that launched the #MeToo movement, which Time Magazine named its Person of the Year on Wednesday (Dec. 6).  Heller's claims about what she says happened that night in June 2015 -- including pictures she gave the magazine of her in a mask and furry handcuffs that were allegedly taken on the night in question -- include her admission of being wracked with guilt for years as the pair remained friends.  ""I think I was invalidating my own experience for so long because she's not a man,"" Heller said. ""Plus, she was my friend, and I sat with what happened in silence because I didn't want to be malicious."" A representative for Martinez told Newsweek that ""Melanie stands by her statement.""

"Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the brave few to show up on the Met Gala red carpet actually wearing one of Rei Kawakubo's Commes Des Garçons designs , becoming part of an exclusive group that included Rihanna and Caroline Kennedy . The Black-ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG's Spring 2016 ""Blue Witch"" collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh's arm-encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn't exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Commes Des Garçons.  Still, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , she felt it was an honor to wear it. Should it be such a surprise that the daughter of one of pop's greatest fashion risk takers, Diana Ross , would be completely fine with exchanging her full range of arm movement for a once-in-a-lifetime red carpet moment?  Kimmel, of course, is not exactly enamored by the world of fashion and is often bemused at its excesses (see his feud with Kanye West over the idea of leather jogging pants, in particularly). So naturally he had to have Ross walk him through why she chose to wear the look.  Ross explained she was attending as a guest of online retailer Farfetched, which just happens to carry Comme Des Garçons, so she actually got to wear a piece from the label (many other celebs attended as the guests of other fashion labels, and as per tradition and common courtesy, wore their host's creations, and thus explaining why so few celebs seemed to go full-out with the theme).  ""The designer who was the cochair was Comme Des Garçons, Rei Kawakubo. So she's a very avant-garde designer. Very arts meet fashion,"" explained an excited Ross. ""So I got to wear a Commes Des Garçons dress""  ""It was such a big deal in fashion, and it was a huge deal for me,"" continued Ross. ""I feel like my mom taught me about glamour, and growing up I was a big fashion girl. I had magazines and loved that world, and so it was a big deal. It was a very big deal to wear that designer.""  After a picture of Ross in the outfit popped up behind the host, Ross had to convince him for a second that it was actually a big fashion moment, but did admit its particularly drawbacks.  ""As you can tell, there's not a lot of movement I could do in the dress,"" she explained. ""So it was a little bit like...couldn't lift me arms up, couldn't hug people because if I lift my arms up too high the dress would come up.""  Kimmel's take away: he thought about the idea of teaming up with Kawakubo to get celebrities to wear the most ridiculous things possible in the name of fashion.  ""I'm going to contact Rei, and Rei and I are going to work out a scheme where we come up with the most ridiculous things and try to get famous people to wear them.  ""I'm going to put somebody in a big Sprite bottle.""  Actually, dressing someone in a Sprite bottle sounds more like Jeremy Scott for Moschino than Rei Kawakubo to us, but point taken.

"There have been dozens of dance crazes that have taken over households through the decades. The 1920s saw the jitterbug and the Charleston. The 1960s had the ""Mashed Potato,"" and the twist. And who can forget about the ""Macarena,"" which came to define the 1990s (I still know how to do the dance, move-by-move). This decade also saw its fair share of fad dances: ""Gangham Style,"" the dab, the Harlem Shake, and ""Hit the Quan,"" to name a few. Now you can add a new one to that list: ""Scooby Doo Papa""? I know what you're thinking: What is ""Scooby Doo Papa""? It's an infectious Latin dance track that's become viral thanks to two social media sensations.  New York-based artist DJ Kass released ""Scooby Doo Papa"" back in September, but it didn't catch fire until YouTubers Lele Pons and Inanna Sarkis featured the song in two Instagram videos, according to The Daily Mail. The two social media stars created a dance routine to go along with ""Scooby Doo Papa,"" which they showed off in their first video posted to Instagram back in December. It became an internet sensation in Latin America, and now has finally reached the United States, The Daily Mail reported.  Lele Pons, who has more than 22 million Instagram followers, posted the second video in January (Sarkis has more than seven million Instagram followers). Together, both videos have racked up more than 58 million views, according to E! News.  In both of the videos, the Instagram stars are dressed up as Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley from the original Scooby Doo gang. Pons couldn't keep a straight face in the first video, which shows the duo having fun dancing around in a kitchen. The second video has a bit more production, with a crew of backup dancers supporting Sarkis, who took on the Velma persona.  And their fans are loving ""Scooby Doo Papa."" On the December video, one Instagram user commented on Sarkis' expression, saying ""your face, damn love you so much."" Another wrote, ""Goofy dancing... check.""  The video Pons posted to her Instagram account in January received an equal amount of love from her fans and other social media users alike. One Instagram user wrote, ""This is so funny I can't,"" in all caps. Another called the video ""the funniest."" And others commented on how much they love the song by DJ Kass, who was born in the Dominican Republic.  But Pons and Sarkis aren't the only ones dancing to ""Scooby Doo Papa."" Search YouTube, and you'll find a ton of videos of people moving to DJ Kass's hit song. Mexican television hosts, Peru's National Police Department, and students have all filmed themselves dancing the ""Scooby Doo Papa"" routine, according to The Daily Mail.  As a native New Yorker, it's awesome to see music from a New York-based DJ exploding online. DJ Kass is popular in clubs in the city, particularly in the Bronx, where is based, according to his website. The 26-year-old father comes from a line of DJs; his father was a popular local DJ, too. Now he is making waves across Latin America and the United States.  Back in 2014, DJ Kass wrote on his website about his future plans in music, according to E! News,  For now, I’m currently involved in learning how to produce and create edits. I just want to be heard, appreciated, and known in this world for giving a great show and best of all, entertaining the crowd because I live through them.  ""Scooby Doo Papa"" and the viral response to the song is definitely proof that DJ Kass has achieved his goal as a musician.

Johnny Depp and his former business managers have ended a contentious lawsuit that saw the details of the star’s financial expenditures laid bare.  Ahead of the August 15 start of the trail, Depp and TMG settled the suit in a mediation meeting on Friday, PEOPLE confirms. It ended a year and a half of claims made by both the star and his former managers that captivated headlines.  “Johnny Depp is pleased to have achieved a settlement agreement with The Management Group following the legal action he took against the company in January 2017,” an attorney for Depp says in a statement to PEOPLE. “The lawsuit taken out against The Management Group ­and the subsequent settlement is a further demonstration that Johnny is determined to take firm action to protect his personal and artistic reputation in the interests of his family and his career.”  The statement continued, “Following the settlement, Johnny is pleased to be able to revert his full attention to his ongoing artistic endeavors, notably the second leg of the sold-out Hollywood Vampires global tour and the exciting launch of JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which will be released in theaters in November this year. Johnny extends his most sincere thanks and appreciation to the true supporters that have shown their loyalty to both him and his family over recent years.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Johnny Depp Harry Durrant/Getty  The Pirates of the Caribbean star sued his former business team at The Management Group (TMG) for $25 million in a fraud lawsuit in January 2017. TMG fired back with a cross-complaint the next month, claiming the actor lived an “ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.”  Depp claimed in his initial complaint that his managers’ negligence had cost him millions, but in their response, TMG painted him as a compulsive spender who blew his $650 million fortune on mansions, yachts, cars, collectables and booze.  The actor attempted to set the record straight on his spending in an expansive interview with Rolling Stone last month, where he upped the figures on some of the spending claims made by TMG.  “It’s insulting to say that I spent $30,000 on wine,” Depp said, referring to the suit alleging that the actor spent that much on wine a month. “Because it was far more.”  WATCH: Lawsuit Claims Johnny Depp Is in Financial Crisis Due to Spending $2 Million a Month on ‘Ultra-Extravagant Lifestyle’  He also took issue with another TMG claim concerning the cost of shooting his friend and famed journalist Hunter S. Thompson’s ashes out of a cannon. TMG claimed the send-off cost $3 million, but Depp puts the figure a tad higher.  “By the way, it was not $3 million to shoot Hunter into the f—– sky,” Depp corrected. “It was $5 million.”  In the end, Depp admitted the legal battle had taken a personal toll. “My son had to hear about how his old man lost all his money from kids at school, that’s not right,” he complained.	0
Our hearts are broken. The shockwaves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened.  You touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized. In the past few days, we’ve seen an outpouring of love and support, both public and private, from around the world. Talinda and the family appreciate it, and want the world to know that you were the best husband, son, and father; the family will never be whole without you.  Talking with you about the years ahead together, your excitement was infectious. Your absence leaves a void that can never be filled – a boisterous, funny, ambitious, creative, kind, generous voice in the room is missing. We’re trying to remind ourselves that the demons who took you away from us were always part of the deal. After all, it was the way you sang about those demons that made everyone fall in love with you in the first place. You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human. You had the biggest heart, and managed to wear it on your sleeve.  Our love for making and performing music is inextinguishable. While we don’t know what path our future may take, we know that each of our lives was made better by you. Thank you for that gift. We love you, and miss you so much.	0
"In February, Alicia Silverstone and Christopher Jarecki announced they were divorcing after 20 years together. The couple has a six-year-old son together, Bear Blu. (Photo: Frazer Harrison, Getty Images)  Alicia Silverstone has filed for divorce from her husband of nearly 13 years, actor and musician Christopher Jarecki.  The divorce papers were filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday, according to the Associated Press.  The Clueless star, 41, had separated from Jarecki, 47, in February after more than 20 years together as a couple.  At the time the couple said in a statement that ""they still deeply love and respect each other and remain very close friends.""  The papers state the couple will share custody of their 7-year-old son, Bear Blue Jarecki, according to the AP.  More: Alicia Silverstone, husband Christopher Jarecki separate after 20 years together  The divorce papers cite irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and say spousal support will be based on a prenuptial agreement the couple signed when they were married, without giving details.  The two married in a beachfront ceremony in June 2005 after dating for 8 years.  The couple went vegan together, leading to Silverstone's second career as a cookbook author. She has published two: 2009's The Kind Diet, followed by a vegan pregnancy guide, The Kind Mama, in 2014.  Silverstone is set to star in Paramount Network’s American Woman (June 7), a half-hour dramedy set in the ‘70s and inspired by The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’ Kyle Richards.

"House of Cards is one of Netflix's biggest shows, but one of its stars is still not getting an equal share of the deck.  Robin Wright made headlines last year when she said she wasn't being paid the same as costar Kevin Spacey.  In an interview last May with Judith Rodin, the president of The Rockefeller Foundation, Wright said she told producers ""I want to be paid the same as Kevin.""  ""I was looking at the statistics and Claire Underwood's character was more popular than [Frank's] for a period of time,"" Wright said. ""So I capitalized on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public.'""  Robin Wright demanded equal 'House of Cards' pay  Spacey was reportedly being paid $500,000 an episode in 2014. Forbes reported in 2015 that Wright made estimated $5.5 million from ""House of Cards,"" which comes out to approximately $420,000 an episode.  But in a recent interview with United Airlines in-flight magazine Rhapsody the actress said that increased payday never came.  ""I don't think I'm getting paid the same amount,"" she said. ""They told me I was getting a raise. But ... I don't think so.""  Wright said she never intended to become a spokesperson for gender pay disparity but ""That was one of 20 questions they asked me, and it went viral.""  According to the publication, Media Rights Capital -- the company that produces ""House of Cards"" -- noted it wasn't possible for the two actors to make the same since Spacey is one of the show's founding producers.  Instead, Wright received an executive producer credit and the opportunities to serve as director.  She said in the Rhapsody interview, ""I really don't like being duped.""  ""It's such a male-dominant workforce still,"" Wright said. ""There's a conditioning. And changing the condition of men is what needs to happen.""  Last year Forbes named Spacey the 12th highest paid TV actor of 2016, estimating he earned $10.5 million for his role as the diabolical Underwood. Wright did not make their list last year of the 15 highest paid TV actresses."	0

It’s Tom Cruise’s big butt and he cannot lie. In August, an eagle-eyed Valkyrie viewer, amazed by the thickness on display, suggested that the actor was using some sort of movie magic. Was it a butt double? Or a prosthetic? VFX? A cushion? Screen Rant asked Cruise to clear up the bun debate, which he apparently had no idea about. “There was no prosthetic in Valkyrie. No,” he confirmed. Cruise thought the question was funny, and further clarified that he does his own booty work in Doug Liman’s American Made, in which he playfully moons his onscreen wife Sarah Wright. “It’s me,” Cruise told Screen Rant. “It’s not CGI, it’s me. I do my own mooning in films. So let it be known — I do my own mooning.”  hello, please, i present the theory that for one single shot in Valkyrie (2008), at 5:12, tom cruise wears a fake butt. observe: pic.twitter.com/Tw6yTbsQUe — swizz keats (@iluvbutts247) August 20, 2017	0

Meghan Markle at Christmas 2017 Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  Meghan joined the royal family for their Christmas celebrations last year, despite it being unusual for non-married partners of senior members of the family to join the Queen for Christmas Day celebrations. Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. — and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fiancée by his side.  Despite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate’s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family. They will stay at their nearby home of Anmer Hall with children Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and 8-month-old Prince Louis.

Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland.  Despite previous reports that Doria was invited to spend Christmas with the royal family, PEOPLE confirms that the Los-Angeles based yoga instructor and social worker will not be in Norfolk.  The Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Kate and William decided to skip spending Christmas at Sandringham in 2016. Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate’s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.  The news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year. Doria may have rooms set aside for her in the cottage, located close to the house where Harry and Meghan’s evening wedding party was held and where their engagement photos were taken about a year ago, but she’s not making a permanent move there.	0

"Brett Ratner and Serena Williams in 2004.

In the 90-second clip, Ratner and Williams, his girlfriend at the time, appear to be arguing over issues they've been having with their long-distance relationship while they watch a tennis match her sister is playing in.  Ratner is physically affectionate and touches Williams throughout the video, even though Williams does not appear to enjoy it.  ""Give me some love,"" Ratner says as he continues to touch her. ""Show me that you care.""  A seemingly frustrated Williams eventually asks Ratner if he can just watch her sister play and says he's ""being very disturbing.""  Williams cheers for her sister, and Ratner joins in by yelling, ""Sexy legs!""  In the clip, Williams tells Ratner she wants to see other people.  ""It's too bad it didn't work out between us,"" she says.  Ratner replies, ""Is this the breakup episode?""  Ratner then tries to kiss Williams, but she rebuffs him.  ""They don't do this on Nick and Jessica's show,"" Ratner says, referring to Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson's reality-TV series. Ratner tries to kiss Williams once more but is again rejected.

The rapper has previously stunned fans using social media. In 2015 Kanye stunned fans by tweeting that he was $53m (£41m) in debt.  ""I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt,” he wrote. “Please pray we overcome...This is my true heart...""  His disappearance comes as Kanye and his wife Kim who have two children, have increased the levels of security at their home following the burglary she experienced last year when over $10m (£7.7m) worth of jewelry was taken from her at gunpoint."	0
Today, the New York Times reported allegations of sexual misconduct against photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber, which they have challenged or denied. Both have been contributors to Vogue and Condé Nast for many years. Below is a personal response from Vogue’s Editor in Chief and Condé Nast Artistic Director Anna Wintour.  The past several months have been an extraordinary time of reckoning and change, and I, like so many others, have been astonished by the courage of those who have come forward to tell stories of sexual misconduct. Abuse of power has gone on for too long in so many places—including in Washington, in Hollywood, in broadcasting, journalism, Silicon Valley, and last but not least, in fashion, where many young women and men have spoken up about manipulation and coercion on go-sees, on shoots, and in other working environments. I’m proud to say that Condé Nast is responding, here and internationally, with a new Code of Conduct, a set of guidelines for outside contributors which has emerged after bracingly honest discussions—with model advocates and agents, stylists, photographers, hair and makeup artists, set designers, and many of our own editors. The goal of these conversations has been to understand how we can create safe and positive environments for everyone we work with. These are some of the decisions we have made:  *All models appearing in fashion shoots commissioned by Condé Nast must be 18 years of age or older. The only exceptions will be those appearing as themselves as part of a profile, news story, or similar content, and they will be required to have a chaperone on set at all times.  *Alcohol will no longer be allowed on Condé Nast sets. Recreational drugs are not permitted.  *Photographers will no longer be permitted to use a Condé Nast set for any work that is not commissioned or approved by the company.  *Any shoot involving nudity, sheer clothing, lingerie, swimwear, simulated drug or alcohol use, or sexually suggestive poses must be approved in advance by the subject.  Even as we stand with victims of abuse and misconduct, we must also hold a mirror up to ourselves—and ask if we are doing our utmost to protect those we work with so that unacceptable conduct never happens on our watch. Sometimes that means addressing the fact that such behavior can occur close to home. Today, allegations have been made against Bruce Weber and Mario Testino, stories that have been hard to hear and heartbreaking to confront. Both are personal friends of mine who have made extraordinary contributions to Vogue and many other titles at Condé Nast over the years, and both have issued objections or denials to what has emerged. I believe strongly in the value of remorse and forgiveness, but I take the allegations very seriously, and we at Condé Nast have decided to put our working relationship with both photographers on hold for the foreseeable future.	0

"Chrissy Teigen Posts Photo of Luna and Miles Taking a Bath Together — and Her Caption Is Spot On  Chrissy Teigen posted two photos of her kids — Luna and Miles — taking a bath, and if you have a social media account, there's a very good chance that you already know what the internet usually has to say about that. Which is why the mom of two was one step ahead of potential online trolls and posted a caption condemning anyone who had a negative thing to say about her sink-bathing babies.  ""Heart explodes,"" she wrote alongside the first snap. ""And heads up, if you have some weird issue with this, you're weird.""  Although some commenters admonished her for not caring ""about all the perverts out there"" and insisted that she keep naked photos like this private, most of her fans applauded her message and hilariously took issue with everything but her adorable kiddos.  ADVERTISEMENT  ""The only problem I have with this is your sink is about as big as my bathtub,"" one person wrote. Another echoed the sentiment: ""I have an issue with the copper faucet . . . I want one!""  Still others noticed the ""creepy red doll on the side of the sink."" One person wrote: ""I have a HUGE issue with the staples in the back of Elmo's head. WHO HURT HIM?"" to which Teigen replied, ""oh my god he's a monster I didn't notice.""  Finally, others marveled at the ""baby bucket"" in the second photo. Apparently, baby buckets such as those mimic the feeling of floating in the womb and are even safer for babies than a normal tub where they can more easily slip.  Fans joked: ""nobody puts baby in a bucket,"" and ""You could have taken the leaves out first."""	0

"CLOSE They took their Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan fandom to a whole new level. USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.  ""It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),"" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night.  MORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan  The special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding's life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim.  But Harding's mother isn't fan.  “I don’t give a (expletive) about the movie,"" said LaVona ""Sandy"" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. ""I don’t care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.”  MORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking  Janney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother.  Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to ""spank"" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument.  “Take a lie detector (expletive),"" Harding said in response to her mother's denials.  MORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic 'I, Tonya'  Kerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit.  ""I have two Olympics medals,"" Kerrigan said. ""They didn’t just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.”  Harding didn't deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women's figure skating.  ""Sure. Why not?"" Harding said. ""I mean, I was there. I skated.”  Harding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith).  ""Enough apologizing,"" Harding said. ""She has her life. I have my life. We both have wonderful lives. That should be all that matters.""  PHOTOS: Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan"	0
"What is Brad Pitt's net worth? Find out how much Brad Pitt is worth - the answer may surprise you!  Brad Pitt is one of Hollywood's most famous and well-loved actors, so it comes as no surprise that he has earned an incredible fortune throughout his successful career. With accolades ranging from an Oscar to the title of Sexiest Man Alive, the 54-year-old star is a true all-rounder in Tinseltown. According to The Richest, Brad is worth more than fellow Hollywood heavyweights Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Mark Wahlberg and Harrison Ford.  So, exactly how much has the father-of-six amassed so far in his career? We take a look at his ventures in acting, producing, and brand endorsements, all of which have contributed to his fortune.  Brad Pitt's Net Worth  Brad Pitt has an estimated net worth of £182million ($240 million), according to The Richest. He places 21st on their list of richest actors, just behind Leonardo DiCaprio, who is worth £186million ($245million).  According to Forbes, one of Brad's highest earning years was between 2015 and 2016, where he earned £24million.  Brad began acting in 1987, at the age of 23  Brad Pitt's acting career  Brad was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and went on to study journalism and advertising at the University of Missouri. But weeks before graduating, Brad dropped out to pursue acting in L.A. His first gig in Hollywood was dressing up in a chicken suit at El Pollo Loco restaurant on Sunset Boulevard!  Brad kicked off his acting career in 1987 with appearances in the primetime US soap opera Dallas, as well as police drama 21 Jump Street. A year later, at the age of 24, Brad landed his first lead role in a film, starring as Rick, a young man with a rare skin condition, in The Dark Side of the Sun.  But it wasn't until 1991, when Brad landed his breakout role in adventure movie Thelma and Louise, that he became a recognisable face on the Hollywood scene.  On his way to becoming the acting icon he is today, Brad has starred in countless blockbuster movies, including The Ocean's Trilogy, Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Troy.  Throughout his long-standing career, Brad has worked on some incredibly high-earning films. The Ocean's trilogy offered a reported salary of £7.6million to its stars, who also included George Clooney and Matt Damon. The third instalment, Ocean's Thirteen, grossed £237million.  Brad starred in Ocean's Eleven alongside Matt Damon and George Clooney  Brad's highest grossing film was World War Z (2013), which earned him an estimated £10.6million and made a total of £383million at the box office.  Brad's successful films have seen him bring home an Oscar – as a producer for Best Picture 12 Years a Slave in 2014 – a Golden Globe, an Emmy, a BAFTA and a SAG Award.  Mr and Mrs Smith, the film on which he met his second wife, Angelina Jolie, grossed £364 million.  Brad Pitt's work in film producing  In 2001, with his acting career going from strength to strength, Brad turned his hand to film production by setting up his own company – Plan B Entertainment. He co-founded the business with Jennifer Aniston, his wife at the time, and the late producer Brad Grey. Plan B Entertainment produced three Oscar-winning films: The Departed, 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight, as well as other popular flicks: Eat, Pray, Love, Kick-Ass and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. When Brad and Jennifer divorced in 2005, Brad became the sole owner of the company, and Brad Grey became the CEO of Paramount Pictures.  As of 2017, Plan B is thought to have a net worth of £77,846.  Marriage and divorce from Jennifer Aniston  Brad and Friends star Jennifer Aniston met in 1998 after being set up by their agents, and made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 1999 Emmy Awards. The pair married in 2000, but five years later, Jennifer filed for divorce in 2005. It was reported that the couple reached a £45million settlement, with Jen claiming £22million, and Brad taking £23.6million. Whilst Jennifer kept their Beverly Hills mansion, Brad ended up with full control over Plan B Entertainment.  Brad and Jennifer make their public debut as a couple in 1999  Marriage and divorce from Angelina Jolie  Brad met actress Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr and Mrs Smith in 2005, causing a considerable stir in Hollywood due to his marriage to Jennifer Aniston at the time, although the pair claim that they didn't get together until Brad officially split from Jen. The pair soon became Hollywood's power couple and married in 2014 at Chateau Miraval the £45million French mansion Brad had bought with Angelina in 2008.  'Brangelina', as they became known, had a combined net worth of £304million ($400million) according to reports.  Brad and Angelina married in 2014  However, the pair split in 2016 after a reported incident on a private plane, which was thought to have involved their eldest son, Maddox. At the time, Angelina, 43, released a statement confirming that they had split for the ""health of the family"". Angelina reportedly did not request spousal support.  Despite their split, the pair have kept Chateau Miraval as an investment. The mansion is complete with a vineyard which produces Miraval Rosé – another source of income for the Jolie-Pitts.  Last year, Brad opened up about his split in an interview with GQ Style, saying: ""You've got a cliché: 'If you love someone, set them free.' Now I know what it means, by feeling it. It means to love without ownership. It means expecting nothing in return.""  MORE: Angelina Jolie says 'I don't enjoy being single' in rare interview after split with Brad Pitt  Brad Pitt's children  Brad has six children, three adopted and three biological, who he shares with ex-wife, Angelina. Their eldest son, 16-year-old Maddox, was adopted from Cambodia when he was seven-months-old, while their eldest daughter, Zahara, was adopted from Ethiopia in 2005. They adopted their fourth child, Pax Thien, from Vietnam in 2003.

The pictures jointly sold for £10.4million – the most expensive celebrity photos in history. The proceeds were given to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, the pair's joint charity which supports causes close to their hearts.  Brad is joined on the red carpet by Pax, Shiloh and Maddox  RELATED: Angelina Jolie ordered by court to give children more time with ex-husband Brad Pitt  Brand endorsements  Being one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, Brad has naturally taken on several lucrative brand deals. In 2012, he became the first man to represent the women's perfume brand Chanel No. 5. The luxurious label reportedly paid him £5.3million.  He also raked in £2.9million for starring in one TV advert for beer brand Heineken, which aired during the 2005 Super Bowl final.

He starred in a short film named The Audition to advertise Studio City Casino in Macau, China. Brad appeared alongside Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio in the short film, which was directed by Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese.

In 2001, Brad took part in the America: A Tribute to Heroes charity telethon in aid of the victims of 9/11. According to tax records, Brad and Angelina donated more than £6million to charity in 2006.

Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that Hollywood elites killed his unborn child and destroyed the relationship he had with the child’s mother, Selena Gomez, as a way of punishing him.  Since finding God last year, Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Wednesday he shared what he called “the worst moment in my life” with the congregation and explained why he had to retire from the music industry.  Telling churchgoers that he will “never go back” to the “evil music industry” until the “pedophiles and monsters at the top of the game are run out of town” and everything is “disinfected with bleach and sunshine,” Bieber explained how Hollywood elites tried to corrupt him.  “They tried so hard to corrupt me,” Bieber said, “because I reached a level they couldn’t control anymore.”  “They tried to destroy me with alcohol and when that didn’t work they tried with drugs – all different kinds. Then when that didn’t work they tried to destroy me with ambition.”  “I was interested at first,” Bieber acknowledged, before saying “but when I realized what the price of admission is in that world, I had to quit.”  “Selena and I were expecting. It was early days and we hadn’t told anyone. At the same time I was being courted by some really powerful people, the most powerful people in Hollywood.”  Describing a top-secret party attended by record industry executives, Bieber said he was shown into a back room where a group of men wearing masks were sitting around the edge of the room, drinking from cups. In the center of the room a dead child was sitting cross-legged, propped up against the back of a chair. It looked like a late-stage fetus and was completely drained of blood.  “The baby’s entire scalp wasn’t there. Its skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone. Portions of the right side of its undeveloped little face had been torn away. You could see bite marks and bruises all over its tiny body.”  “They were wearing animal masks, sitting around drinking what they called ‘red wine.’ They offered me some. It was obvious that it was really important for them that I got involved.  “I literally gagged at this point. One of them boasted the baby had been alive for eight hours after they started cutting it and draining its blood.”  “When he described the pain the baby went through, he seemed pleased with himself.”  The horrific death described by Bieber to his congregation is called “exsanguination”, otherwise known as completely draining a person of blood. The practice is popular among drinkers of baby blood who consume what they call “red wine” in order to get high on the adrenaline, young hormones, and negative energy they believe is found in the blood of children.  They believe the more a child suffers before its death, the more “enriched” its blood will be upon harvest. Often the child is physically and sexually abused before it is killed in order to create the necessary trauma.  Bieber refused to drink the blood and that is when “everything started going wrong.”  “They threatened me. They said they knew Selena was pregnant. They asked if I wanted my baby to end up like the one in the center of the room.”  “This completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,” said Bieber, fighting back tears. “They murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena… we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.”  But years have passed since the traumatic episode and Bieber has vowed to protect her and become a family man. Acknowledging rumors that the pair are back together, Bieber even hinted he is set to become a family man.  “They won’t lay a hand on my family so help me God,” he said.  “There are truly evil forces at work in the world. God is real. Satan is real,” Bieber said, before exiting the stand.  These latest allegations from Justin Bieber add to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman, Mel Gibson and Lindsay Lohan have spoken out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. As more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision.	1
"Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are hearing wedding bells. Not their own, though—the musical duo reportedly traveled to Jamaica over the weekend to attend Bieber's dad Jeremy's wedding. And, of course, the ""Love Yourself"" singer scored himself a starring role in the nuptials as a groomsman!  According to People , the ""Love Yourself"" singer flew to Texas on Sunday to pick up Gomez before the pair made their way to the Caribbean.

"Amal Clooney has given birth to twins, Ella and Alexander, Clooney’s publicist to the Associated Press. The boy and girl are the first children for the attorney and her husband, George Clooney.  Clooney's rep has also already weighed in with some humor:  Julie Chen, a friend of the couple, first announced the Clooney’s pregnancy news on her CBS show, The Talk, in February. Since then, Amal Clooney has been spotted with her husband at the Cesar Awards in February and at the United Nations in March; she has been continuing her work as a human-rights lawyer, which she has done since the early 2000s.  George Clooney, who was one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors before marrying Amal in September 2014 at the age of 53, told People in February that his friends, whose children are all grown and in college, had taken to jokingly ribbing him about his late-in-life fatherhood. Despite the quips from his pals, Clooney was ready to take on the challenge.  “Look, it’s exciting,” Clooney said. “And we’re really happy and really excited, and it’s going to be an adventure. We’ve sort of embraced it all . . . with arms wide open.”  WATCH: Celebrity Parents Who Have Twins  Julia Roberts, mother of twins and Clooney's longtime pal, has already stepped in with advice for the new dad, per People.  “There’s no such thing as wisdom when you have twin babies in the house,” she said. “There’s just hopes and prayers and tears and holding on tight to each other.”  The Clooneys will reportedly raise their twins in London, where they have been living in the months leading up to the babies’ birth.  Friends are already weighing in on how the 56-year-old will be as a brand new father. Matt Damon added his insight in an interview with Entertainment Tonight:  “He’ll be great, he’ll be a mess, but [Amal] will take care of everything.""

WARNING: This article contains spoilers from The Walking Dead season eight, episode eight. The extended episode titled ‘How It’s Gonna Be’ unleashed a shocking move as it was revealed Carl Grimes (played by Chandler Riggs) had been bitten by a walker. In the tense instalment, Rick Grimes’ son (Andrew Lincoln) had offered his own life to Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) as they arrived to bomb Alexandria. He told the leader of the Saviours: “If you have to kill someone, if there have to be punishments, then kill me. I’m serious.”  AMC The Walking Dead season 8: Carl Grimes' days are numbered  “You want to die?” Negan asked. Carl replied: “No, I don’t. But I will. It’s gonna happen. And if me dying can stop this, if it can make things different for us, for you, for all those other kids, it’d be worth it.” His bold decision soon made sense to viewers at the end of the episode when a huge bite mark on his torso was shown. With Carl’s days numbered, will his death be played out in the first episode when the show returns next year?  AMC The Walking Dead season 8: Rick Grimes will be devastated to hear his son is dying  The shock twist of Carl's impending death left fans of the hit show in floods of tears. One distraught fan wrote on Twitter: “ARE YOU SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME...OH MY GOD I AM SITTING IN A PUDDLE OF TEARS RIGHT NOT WHY DOES TWD ALWAYS DO THIS TO ME #TheWalkingDead.” “If you need me I’ll be crying over Carl #TWD #TheWalkingDead,” said another upset viewer. However, some fans were clinging on to the hope of a cure as one person wrote: “I’m not fully convinced that Carl is going to die. I don’t know how, but I feel like he’s going to live. #TheWalkingDead.”  AMC The Walking Dead season 8: Carl Grimes was bitten  The Walking Dead: Then and now Fri, June 16, 2017 Walking Dead: The cast of the cult show pictured then and now.

"Safe to say, this John McEnroe-Serena Williams debate has gone from an overblown sports controversy to an entirely pointless one.  It started on NPR over the weekend when McEnroe, on a promotional tour for his new book, “But Seriously,” caught some heat for a comment he made about Serena Williams:  Garcia-Navarro: We’re talking about male players but there is of course wonderful female players. Let’s talk about Serena Williams. You say she is the best female player in the world in the book. McEnroe: Best female player ever — no question. Garcia-Navarro: Some wouldn’t qualify it, some would say she’s the best player in the world. Why qualify it? McEnroe: Oh! Uh, she’s not, you mean, the best player in the world, period? Garcia-Navarro: Yeah, the best tennis player in the world. You know, why say female player? McEnroe: Well because if she was in, if she played the men’s circuit she’d be like 700 in the world. Garcia-Navarro: You think so? McEnroe: Yeah. That doesn’t mean I don’t think Serena is an incredible player. I do, but the reality of what would happen would be I think something that perhaps it’d be a little higher, perhaps it’d be a little lower. And on a given day, Serena could beat some players. I believe because she’s so incredibly strong mentally that she could overcome some situations where players would choke ’cause she’s been in it so many times, so many situations at Wimbledon, The U.S. Open, etc. But if she had to just play the circuit — the men’s circuit — that would be an entirely different story.  As I wrote at the time, it was a pretty ‘gotcha’ line of questioning from the host. McEnroe repeatedly lavished praise on Serena’s ability but didn’t steer away from the line of questioning above, creating a backlash that Serena responded to on Monday:  Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based. — Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017  I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir — Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017  McEnroe could’ve just left it there, but his tennis player instinct to volley back apparently cropping back up, he did the opposite. McEnroe doubled down on the comment by refusing to apologize.  ""Would you like to apologize?"" — @NorahODonnell  ""No."" — John McEnroe pic.twitter.com/BFN8w2EyfY — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 27, 2017  Clarified that he didn’t know it would create controversy, and that he didn’t intend to bother Serena during her pregnancy.  ""It wasn't necessary…. I didn't know it would create controversy."" — John McEnroe on his Serena Williams comments pic.twitter.com/6YAPtZ80mp — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 27, 2017  Following with a claim that, at 58, he would right now rank 1,200 on if he played full time.  Where would John McEnroe rank himself?  ""I would be, currently, about 1,200 in the world."" pic.twitter.com/KJSMBiuBlY — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 27, 2017  Before concluding by mockingly re-ranking the best tennis players in history, putting Serena at No. 5."	0
Meghan Markle, 36, will marry Prince Harry, 33, in a royal wedding ceremony on May 19 2018, and it seems the royal’s wife-to-be stands out from his previous girlfriends in one particular way.  It is known Prince Harry had high profile relationships with Chelsy Davy, 32, and Cressida Bonas, 29, before he began dating Meghan in 2016.  However, a royal expert has said no previous romantic interest had ever “tamed” Harry in the way that Meghan has done.  “I think Meghan has had a really positive influence on Harry,” Katie Nicholl, author of Harry Life Loss and Love told Express.co.uk exclusively.  “Historically Harry has always been ‘tamed’ by his girlfriends, we saw that with Chelsy and Cressida, but I think Meghan’s had a bigger influence on him than any other woman.”	1
"Demi Lovato is six years stronger.  The Tell Me You Love Me singer teared up on-stage at her New York City show on Friday night, after tourmates DJ Khaled and Kehlani surprised her during her set to wish her a happy six years of sobriety.  ""What you've overcome through trials and tribulations, through dark clouds,"" Khaled told his friend and collaborator. ""You found the sunshine, and now the sun is shining on you forever.""  ""I'm so, so, so, so proud of you, and honored to know you,"" Kehlani added.  After the two exited, Lovato got emotional while addressing her fans, who had begun chanting her name.  ""Kehlani and DJ Khaled, thank you so much,"" the 25-year-old singer said. ""That was so inspirational and so powerful and so meaningful.""  Lovato then, through tears, walked fans through her sobriety journey.  ""Yesterday, six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning, throwing up in the car,"" she recalled. ""I remember thinking, 'This is no longer cute, this is no longer fun. And I'm just like my dad.' So I took a look at my life, and I said, 'Something has to change. Something has to change, I've gotta get sober' -- so I did.""  ""The reason I became so open about my story is I know that there are people here tonight that need to ask for help, and I want you to know that it's OK,"" she continued as the audience cheered. ""Mental health is something that we all need to talk about and we need to take the stigma away from it.""  I feel weak everytime Demi cries 😭😩 https://t.co/8RZlZ4cxyg — zhania (@lovathiccs) March 17, 2018  After her remarks, Lovato went into a gripping rendition of her song, ""Warrior,"" which deals with painful memories from her past. Lovato has penned songs about her troubled family life growing up, with some of the tracks being about her late father, Patrick, who she has at times referred to as ""abusive.""  Watching Lovato work through her personal struggles has hopefully inspired those who look up to her to do the same.  One emotional rock for Lovato has been her mom, Dianna Hart. On Saturday, Lovato posted to Instagram a sweet photo of her hugging her mother, writing: ""I love my momma so much #myhero.""  ""So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible,"" Lovato tweeted on Wednesday, further celebrating her sixth sober birthday.  Just officially turned 6 years sober. So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible. 🙏🏼 — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) March 15, 2018  ET spoke with Lovato just after she reached five years sober last March, and she opened up about keeping clean.  ""What keeps me on this path is there's a drive that I have to stay sober because I know that my life depends on it,"" she reflected.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense.  “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ‘DEPLORABLES,'” he wrote on on Tuesday night, two days after Sunday’s Primetime Emmy Awards telecast. The President is in New York, staying at Trump Tower, during the United Nations General Assembly.  I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night – the worst ever. Smartest people of them all are the ""DEPLORABLES."" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017  The Emmys, broadcast by CBS, were about on par with last year’s ceremony in terms of total viewers. Sunday’s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016’s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year’s low point of a 2.8.  Host Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump’s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for “The Apprentice.” In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.  According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2013  Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, criticized the “politicized” show for the “sameness” of the attacks on Trump.  Related Rachel Brosnahan on Emmy Win and 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 Trump Names Patrick Shanahan Acting Secretary of Defense, Moves Up Mattis' Departure  “It looks like Americans are tuning out,” she said on “Fox & Friends.”  Then she addressed stars who appeared on the stage. “They want you to stick to your knitting. They want you to stick to the stuff that other people write for you.”  She did, however, praise Sean Spicer for his Emmy cameo, in which he made fun of his own post-inauguration press conference in which he chided the media never its reporting on Trump’s inaugural crowd size. Spicer’s appearance has drawn a backlash from Trump detractors who criticized Colbert and Emmy producers for milking laughs out of a political operative who had been a champion of Trump’s polarizing agenda.  “This is something that folks in Hollywood often lack — which is introspection and good humor,” Conway said of Spicer.  Trump spoke at the UN earlier on Tuesday in a speech in which he said that the U.S. would “totally destroy” North Korea if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies.”"	0
It’s official! At least that is what we think. Emma Watson and Chord Overstreet were photographed kissing earlier this week in Los Angeles, marking the clearest sign that they are romantically involved, less than a month after reports said they had split after dating for a few months.The 28-year-old Harry Potter and Beauty and the Beast actress and the 29-year-old Glee alum and musician who recently released the single Carried Away, were seen in a parking lot locking lips, and they also took selfies, while Overstreet also snapped photographs of Watson posing next to one of the vehicles.  Watson wore a white and red printed feminist “Marchin” T-shirt and black capris, while Overstreet wore a black printed tank top and ripped jeans. The two were later spotted at a movie theatre, a vegan restaurant and a supermarket.	0

Top adviser and potential Cabinet pick Rudy Giuliani will be here.Plus, Trump made big campaign promises, from Obamacare.TRUMP: Repealing and replacing Obamacare.TAPPER: To immigration.TRUMP: There will be no amnesty.TAPPER: And, of course:TRUMP: We will build a great wall.TAPPER: But he seems to be already backing off some of his signature lines. What will really get done? And can he work with Congress? An exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan.Plus, Clinton concedes.HILLARY CLINTON (D), FMR. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for.TAPPER: As Democrats lick their wounds.CLINTON: I'm not going to sugarcoat it. These have been very, very tough days. TAPPER: Should they have seen it coming? Michael Moore did -- what he says liberals must do now.Plus, the best political minds will be here with insights on this historic election.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is in transition.Donald Trump is now president-elect Trump. And the world is watching with bated breath to see just what he has in store for America. Protests against his election, of course, continue this weekend across the country, most of them peaceful, although the mayor of Portland, Oregon, is asking protesters to stand down in the wake of violence against police in that city.There are some reports of violence against Trump supporters. In Connecticut, two men were arrested for allegedly beating a man holding a Trump sign. Meanwhile, civil rights groups in school districts across the country report an uptick in incidents of intimidation and harassment of minority groups and girls and women.Graffiti in North Carolina reads: ""Black lives doesn't matter and neither does your votes.""""Go back to Africa. Make America great again"" was written in a high school bathroom in Minnesota.Tensions are high and tempers are flaring across the country. The country, of course, may be divided, but the government in Washington, D.C., is not. Republicans now control the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and, soon, the White House.So what is on the Trump agenda and how quickly can it get done?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Joining me now from Janesville, Wisconsin, is House Speaker Paul Ryan.Mr. Speaker, thanks so much for joining us.Before we begin talking about legislation and moving forward, I'm just wondering, there are millions of Americans out there, as I'm sure you know, who are frankly terrified about what this America under President Trump will mean for them.Is there anything that you, as speaker of the House, one of the leaders of the nation, want to say to them?REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Sure.First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And, second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured. America is a pluralistic, inclusive country. It has, it has been, and it will continue to be.So, I really think that people should put their minds at ease. We're going to get to work on solving the big country's problems, getting this economy growing, fixing our national security, you know, fixing our health care problems, getting our budget put together, the things that we have been talking about.So, I think people should just really put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic. We're inclusive. That's the kind of country we want. That's the country we are. And that's the country we're still going to have.TAPPER: But just to accept and acknowledge that there are these incidents taking place all over the country...RYAN: Well, first, yes, I heard your lead-in there. That's terrible. That's awful.By the way, that's not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they're not Republicans. And we don't want them in our party, even if they're thinking about it. And I'm confident Donald Trump feels the same way.So, there's no place for that. And protests, as long as protests are peaceful, if people want to express themselves that way, that's what we can do in this country. That's what the First Amendment is all about.TAPPER: Let's move forward to some of the action items.Obviously, repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the big items that president-elect Trump and you want to tackle. President-elect Trump recently said there are elements of Obamacare he wants to keep. This is what he to say to ""60 Minutes."" Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Let me does you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still covered?[09:05:01]TRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the -- strongest asset.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Now, your Better Way agenda talks about spending $25 billion on high-risk pools that would help those with preexisting conditions afford insurance. Where would that $25 billion come from?RYAN: Well, we actually have it paid for in our bill. You really want me to give you a technical answer to this? It gets a little technical.The point is, we have in our plan pay for doing that. Here's the bigger point, Jake. We agree. It's in our plan. Donald Trump agrees with this. We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions.In our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents' plan. So, there are aspects that we have all along agreed to.TAPPER: Under Obamacare, as you know, millions of people were able to get health insurance for the first time through the expansion of Medicaid.What is going happen to those people? Will they lose coverage under your plan?RYAN: Well, if you go -- what I encourage people to do is go to Better.GOP. It's number five on our plan. We put the most detail out of anybody that has put out an Obamacare replacement plan.And it is to have an answer for everyone with preexisting conditions, people who are the uninsured. The point I would say is this, Jake. We can have a health care system in America where everyone, regardless of income or health condition, can get affordable health insurance, get affordable health care.This is what we propose. We think a patient-centered system is the right way to do that. And you can have the system without a costly government takeover, like Obamacare, that is cranking up premiums, that is making deductibles so high. Doesn't even feel like you have health insurance. Obamacare is failing. It must replaced.We're going to do that. We're excited about it. And the point I would put people's minds at ease is, we can fix these problems. We can fix what was broken in health care without breaking what was working in health care. And that's exactly what we're proposing.And if you want to get any level of detail on this, just go to Better.GOP and see what we have already offered.TAPPER: Well, as you know, the Medicaid expansion is providing government-paid health insurance to individuals. I mean, that's what it does. So, if you repeal Obamacare, does it repeal also the Medicaid expansion, or would that part of it stay?RYAN: For example, we propose to replace that with refundable tax credits for people to buy affordable health care insurance.So, the kinds of reforms that we're talking about will lower the cost of insurance itself. And then a person would have, such as our proposal calls for, a refundable tax credit, like a voucher, to go buy health insurance.That's much cheaper, much more affordable. And, more importantly, you get to buy what you want to buy, not what the government is making you buy.TAPPER: Obamacare also provides birth control to women at no cost. Is that going to end or will that remain?RYAN: Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things.TAPPER: With all do respect, I don't know that the average woman of child-bearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don't know that she would think that that's just a nitty-gritty detail. That's...RYAN: You're asking me detail...TAPPER: Well, what do you think? Is it important to you?RYAN: Jake, you're asking me details about legislation -- you're asking me details about legislation that hasn't been written yet.(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Right. But is it important to you? Would that be a principle? Would that be a principle of whatever replaces it, because...RYAN: I'm not going to get into -- I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn't even been drafted yet.TAPPER: Let me ask you a question about improving security at the border. You and Donald Trump both agree you want to improve security at the border. You obviously have different views when it comes to the 10 to 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.This is what you said to say back in April during a town hall at Georgetown University:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: I'm a person who believes that, for the undocumented, we have to come up with a solution that doesn't involve mass deportation, that involves giving people the ability to get right with the law to come and earn a legal status while we fix the rest of legal immigration.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Now take a listen to what president-elect Trump said on ""Morning Joe"" last year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""MORNING JOE"")TRUMP: We're going to have a deportation force. And you're going to do it humanelyQUESTION: How are you going to pay for this?TRUMP: It's very inexpensive.QUESTION: Are they going to be ripped out of their homes? How?TRUMP: Can I tell you, they're going back where they came. If they came from a certain country, they're going to be brought back to that country. That's the way it's supposed to be.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So, Congress writes the laws and controls the purse stringsIs there going to be mass deportation or not? And this isn't just a nitty-gritty detail. There are millions of people who are very worried about this.RYAN: Sure. Sure.And I think we should put people's minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border.We think that's first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who's coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border. So, we believe an enforcement bill, a border security enforcement bill, is really the first priority. And that's what we're focused on.TAPPER: OK, so it's not a top priority, mass deportation. But, obviously, president-elect Trump thinks it is.RYAN: No, securing the border is our...TAPPER: Right.RYAN: Securing the border is our top priority.TAPPER: Right, but about what in year two, year three, year four?RYAN: That's why I'm saying we're not focused on -- we are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that.[09:10:03]TAPPER: Well, let me ask you, and does the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, does that impact in any way your sense of mandate or how far you should be willing to go, considering that the woman who lost actually got more votes?RYAN: I'd say two things.Look at the expectations going into this. Look at what all the public polling said. Look at what all the prognosticators were saying like the day of the election. He beat all the odds.Look, what I think people need to stop doing is stop underestimating Donald Trump. A lot of us did that. I think he's very much of the mind-set that there is a need to unify this country, to heal the division in this country, but also there's a mandate and a desire and a commitment to fix the problems as we have laid the solutions out.So, we all laid out very concrete solutions for why we need to get this country back on track. We're now going to implement the solutions. And we think this is good. We think this is going to help people get out of poverty. We think this is going to grow the economy, make our country more secure, make our border secure, help the military go on offense against ISIS, clean up the red tape that is strangling small businesses, so they can hire people again.These are good things that we have in store that we're really excited about getting to work on doing for the American people.TAPPER: One of the things that you don't mention -- and I can certainly understand why -- when you talk about the path forward with president-elect Trump is one of the biggest differences between yourself and Donald Trump policy-wise, having to do with the issue of trade.In his contract with the American voter, he promised in his 100 days to establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers. Will you pass those tariffs in your first 100 days?RYAN: Well, I think there's a better way of dealing with that particular issue.And if you go to number six on our Better Way agenda and you look at the tax reform, this is something that Donald also talked about during the campaign, which is to fix our taxes on border adjustments, which we believe is a smarter way, which is what all the other countries, which is not tariffs, not trade wars.So, we think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it's fixing our tax code.TAPPER: Throughout the campaign, as you know, president-elect Trump talked about tariffs. It could be as high as 35 percent, 45 percent.RYAN: Yes.TAPPER: If he comes to you and says, this is what we're doing, what are you going say?RYAN: The point I'm trying to make is, I think we can achieve what he's trying -- he's trying to make America more competitive. He's trying to make the American worker more competitive. He's trying to make it so that American businesses stay in America.And we believe the smartest and best way to do that is comprehensive tax reform, which actually makes America much more competitive without any adverse effects, without any collateral damage to the economy.TAPPER: A minute ago, you were talking about how Donald Trump, the president-elect, expressed concerned to you he wanted to -- or expressed a desire to you that he wanted to unify the country. On that note, I want to turn to staffing at the Trump White House. Alot of people, including many conservatives, are concerned that Steve Bannon, who is the CEO of the Trump campaign and the chief executive of Breitbart News, that he used Breitbart News to, in their view, the view of conservatives, the view of Republicans, to mainstream white supremacist views, anti-Semitic views, racist views.Do you have any concerns about Steve Bannon being in the White House?RYAN: No, I don't have concerns. I have never met the guy. I don't know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns.I believe -- I trust Donald's judgment. I think he's going to pick who he thinks will best serve him. And I'm sure we will work well with whoever his chief of staff is, whoever his staff is.So, I believe that Donald is going to have a great set of choices to make for staffing. I'm also very own encouraged by the fact that my friend, a great conservative from -- a man whose shown he's a true leader, Mike Pence, is going to be running the transition team.So, I think between Pence running the transition team -- look, Donald is a multibillionaire who has had lots of companies, who has run extremely successful businesses. So, he's done things like this before. He's staffed up. He's run major organizations. He's a successful person. He surrounds himself with successful people.So, I'm confident he's going to do the same here.TAPPER: You sound very optimistic and positive about him, but during the campaign, you said that one of the things he said about Judge Curiel fit the textbook definition of racism.RYAN: Look, I'm not going to relitigate the past. I'm looking for the future.And I want I mean when I say unifying, getting people back to work, fixing welfare so people -- fixing welfare so people can go from welfare to work, replacing this horrible health care law that is really hurting families, putting health care providers out of business, and replacing it with patient-centered health care, rebuilding our national security so we're safe again, cleaning up the regulatory state, following the Constitution.I mean, these are all good things for our country that we are now working on putting in place the plan to do just that. That's transformational. That's positive. That's good.[09:15:01]TAPPER: The pride of Janesville, House Speaker Paul Ryan, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.RYAN: All right, thank you Jake. Take care.(END VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER: The Trump transition team has been huddled inside Trump Tower all weekend as they work to create an administration, Cabinet nominees, White House staff.Kellyanne Conway telling reports yesterday that Trump's choice for chief of staff is imminent. That and other picks could tell us a lot about how president-elect Trump plans to govern.Let's talk about the new Trump administration with top adviser Rudy Giuliani, who is himself rumored to be a contender for several top jobs.Mr. Mayor, thanks for joining us. And congratulations.RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Thank you, Jake.TAPPER: So, I know you're not going to answer...GIULIANI: Thank you very, very much, Jake.TAPPER: I know you're not going to answer any questions I have about what jobs you're being considered for.(LAUGHTER)TAPPER: So, let me just set that aside.There's a big issue...GIULIANI: Thank you.(LAUGHTER)TAPPER: There's a big issue at play here as you prepare for the Trump administration.I know you're more than cognizant of the fact that Donald Trump has hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in businesses and business interests around the nation and throughout the world. During the campaign, he was asked what he would do with his businesses if he won.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts. I have Ivanka and Eric and Don sitting there.Run the company, kids. Have a good time. I'm going to do it for America, OK?(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)TRUMP: So, I would be willing to...QUESTION: So, you will put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust.Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it, but -- is that a blind trust? I don't know.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: I will answer that question. That's not a blind trust. If your kids run your businesses, it's not a blind trust.In a blind trust, there is an independent trustee who takes over your portfolio and directs it without your input or any input from anyone around you.Do you think that to avoid any conflicts of interest, not to many questions by the public as to whether he's making decisions at least in part for his own financial reasons, do you think it would be best for Mr. Trump to set up a true blind trust with no involvement from him or his kids?GIULIANI: Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.I think he's in a very unusual situation. He would basically put his children out of work if -- and they'd have to go start a whole new business, and that would set up the whole -- set up new problems.So, it would seem to me that if he set up a situation in which the children were running it, there was a legal or clear document that meant that he would not be involved, he would have no interest in it, he would have no input into it, he would just have a passive interest, that would be the kind of thing that would work here.It's kind of unrealistic to say, you're going to take the business away from the three people who are running it, and give it to some independent person. And, remember, they can't work in the government because of the government rule against nepotism.So, you would be putting them out of work. So, I think you're going to have to fashion something that is very comfortable, something that's fair, something that assures the American people, as he said, he has no interest in what's going on in the business, and that his children get to run the business they know how to run.TAPPER: Right.GIULIANI: And stay out of all government matters.TAPPER: Well, but, Mr. Mayor, I mean, his children are -- as I don't need to tell you, they are a huge part of his advisory committee. They are advising the transition, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric.Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, is being talked about as coming on board and working at the White House, even if he's not paid for it.If he does not set up a truly blind trust, how can the American people have confidence that, when he makes a decision, that he isn't at least partly making it to enrich himself?GIULIANI: Well, even if he turned it over to an independent trustee and it was the Trump Corporation, you can't -- I mean, there's no perfect way to do this.You have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president. The man is an enormously wealthy man. I don't think there's any real fear of suspicion that he's seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn't have run for president.So, I think there can be a way to do this. And, by the way, Jared Kushner has his own company, completely independent of Trump, that is a very, very successful real estate company. He's maybe, you know, one of the biggest in New York. He -- so, Jared is a kind of different, different situation.TAPPER: Well, I will just say this. And then you can dismiss it as you want. But I'm putting a flag in it right now.If a blind trust is not set up, this is going to be Donald Trump for the duration of his presidency, because every decision he makes, whether it's the pipeline in North Dakota, or business relationships in Turkey, everything is going to be under the lens of, well, what is the effect of this on his wealth and his family's wealth?[09:20:07]I get that you think that that's not a consideration or not as serious a consideration as...GIULIANI: No, no, no.What I'm telling you is, the blind trust solution isn't much better, meaning an independent trustee would run it. And any decision that he made, even if he didn't know it, that helped him, somebody would run it down and say, oh, my goodness, he may have made it for that reason.So, blind trusts aren't perfect either. This is a very special kind of situation.TAPPER: I think it's far better than -- it's far better than people in his family advising him and then also working on his business. I think...GIULIANI: But they're not -- once he gets into government, they will not be -- they will not be -- they will not be advising him.There will be -- there will have to be a wall -- there will have to be a wall between them with regard to government matters and something I'm very familiar with from my days in the Justice Department, which is recusing yourself from decisions that involve you or any financial matter involving you.TAPPER: All right.Well, if you thought the issues between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department were big, fasten your seat belts. But let's move on.Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary by...GIULIANI: Oh, I think, I think, Jake, Jake, Jake, I think that's a very unfair suggestion.There, you were talking about enormous amounts of cash. I'm counting up to about $230 million that went for specific actions like talking to the IRS. And I don't -- I don't see that happening in a Trump administration.This man didn't run for president because he wants to get rich. He's rich already.TAPPER: All right.GIULIANI: So, I don't think you're going to have that happen unless you try to make it happen.TAPPER: All right.Mr. Trump shook up the Republican primary back in December when he made this promise. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling all and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is doing on.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So, just a simple question. Is that policy still operative?GIULIANI: Well, you know, twice, you used things that he changed during the campaign. He did say that. That is correct.Actually, within a day or two of his saying that, he called me and asked me to put a little group together that included Congressman McCaul, General Flynn -- I can't remember who else, a few other people. We wrote a paper for him. And he amended it to the ban would be restricted to particular countries, and it would not be a ban.It would involve extreme vetting. The one -- the one place in which he would not let anyone in, unless it was an extraordinary circumstance, would be Syrian refugees. All the rest from countries that contain dangerous populations of radical Islamic extremists, he will subject them to extreme vetting, but not a ban. So, he said that about 100 times during the campaign from the timethat he made that -- from the time that he made that statement.TAPPER: Yes, he said that was an expansion.GIULIANI: So, you can go back.TAPPER: He said it was an expansion of his original proposal.But let's talk about what you're talking about, specifically, Mr. Trump wanting to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur and also extreme vetting.Back in June, when Senator Jeff Sessions, a strong supporter and adviser of president-elect Trump, when Senator Sessions was on the program, he identified six countries that might fall into that category, Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen.So, now that Mr. Trump has been elected president, can you tell us if those are the six countries that will see a suspension of immigration?GIULIANI: Well, I would say that those countries are certainly countries where we would have to be very careful.Now, let's take Egypt, for example. Egypt, we could probably do some pretty good vetting. The Sisi government is a strong ally. It has a pretty good hold on the Muslim Brotherhood. I'm not saying perfect, but they have done a lot of work in reducing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood. They have a very, very mature and really strong army. You could do vetting in Egypt.Yemen, a lot more volatile, a lot more difficult to do vetting. So, I think this is going to be a country-by-country decision. Pakistan, you can do pretty good vetting. So, a lot of this is going to depend on, you know, how cooperative is the country we're talking about? How many records can we get?The reason the Syrian problem was so bad, the Syrian refugees, it's not just that you can't vet them, which actually Director Comey and I think about five members of the Obama administration have made clear, that you can't vet these people, these refugees from Syria.[09:25:12]The problem also is that Baghdadi has said he is going to put terrorist operatives in with the refugee population. He's told us he's going to do this.TAPPER: Right.GIULIANI: So, we would be foolish -- we would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States.We're sort of being warned that he's bringing more people into attack us. We already have 1,000 investigations of radical Islamic terrorists in the United States. We can't add another whole group to that.TAPPER: I want to ask you. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted as saying that the Russian government maintained contacts with members of Trump's -- quote -- ""immediate entourage"" during the presidential campaign.What can you tell us about those contacts?GIULIANI: I know of no such contacts with the Russian government.I was pretty deeply involved in the campaign. I was with Donald Trump, you know, day and night for about 100 days actually at one period. So, if that's going on, it's going on somewhere where I didn't see it.It is true that I think Donald Trump wants to engage Russia in areas where we can work together in a way that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama failed to do. But, remember, he's going to do it from a different point of view.You're forgetting his campaign promise of increasing dramatically the size of the military and doing away with the sequester. We're going to go up to 550,000 troops, where we're going down to 420,000.TAPPER: Well, let me ask you a quick question about troops.GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 ships.TAPPER: Putin...GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 350 troops (sic). Let me finish.TAPPER: Yes.GIULIANI: We're going to go up to 1,200 modern aircraft. And we're going to increase the size of the Marines from about 27 battalions to 36.So, he's going to be facing, Putin, with a country that is not diminishing its military, but a country that is dramatically increasing it to Reagan-like levels, so that he can negotiate -- and he talked about this a lot during the campaign -- he's going to negotiate for peace, but with strength, not with a diminishing army.TAPPER: A spokesman for Putin said that one of the first things that Trump can do as president is to convince NATO to pull back troops from near the Russian border.Do you have any idea if any decision has been made along those lines?GIULIANI: No. No decision like that has been made, thought about.In fact, during the campaign, Donald Trump talked about forward positioning of some troops in NATO as kind of a bargaining chip with some of the NATO countries that are not putting in their fair share, their 2 percent. TAPPER: OK.GIULIANI: And I think you're going see something more like that.I think a President Trump would want to increase the impact of NATO, but make sure that these countries are participating. You know, when we were fighting in Iraq and we had some of these countries participating, their armies weren't fighting. They were watching us, the U.K., and Canada fight, and they were just observing.Well, it can't work that way.TAPPER: All right.GIULIANI: They have got to be full participants. And we have to be full participants.TAPPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much. And congratulations again.GIULIANI: Thank you.TAPPER: Donald Trump used the power of social media to help propel him into the White House. He instantly was able to fight back against critics, reporters, even members of his own party if they challenged him, which begged the question, what will President Trump' Twitter feed look like?We now have his answer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all. I'm going to be very restrained.I find it tremendous. It is a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's -- it's where it's at.I do believe this. I really believe that the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: President Obama is going to have to hand over the @POTUS Twitter handle to president-elect Trump.What should we expect from @POTUS when he enters the Oval Office?Joining me now is our panel, Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer, CNN politics reporter Sara Murray, CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson, and House Democratic Caucus Leader Congressman Xavier Becerra of California.Sean, let me start with you.In the final stretch of the campaign, it was reported that some of president-elect Trump's top aides had to wrest his phone away from him, so as to not have one of these sudden outbursts in the middle of the night or whatever.[09:30:10]What do you see going forward for the POTUS account?SEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think there's always a transition from campaigning to governing. You've seen it both with his speech Wednesday morning when he accepted that victory that he won for the American people. And then his comments when he was in Washington, D.C. with the president and others.He understands that. He understands the role of the president in the words that he uses and the tweets that he sends will impact the country in a much different way than they do during a campaign.TAPPER: Good enough for you, congressman?REP. XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA: No, because we've heard all sorts of words from Donald Trump.As a candidate you can say all you want, as a president, one word you say can affect not just markets, but the American people. So interest rates have already spiked. They are not sure what's going to happen in the markets since -- so today we try to buy a house as an American, it costs you more for the mortgage than it did two weeks ago. And so it will make a difference what he says. More importantly what he does.TAPPER: Sara, you covered Trump for the last year and a half. He has since winning, there has been one kind of stray tweet in which he got mad at protesters and then I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but then he corrected it and celebrated their right to protest.How do you see this holding, this quote/unquote ""Presidential Trump""?SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Well, he's already tweeting this morning attacks at ""The New York Times.""So I think the notion that all the sudden Donald Trump has woken up and realized that his weight carry or his words carry a lot more weight doesn't always stand. I think there are aides around him who remind him that you need to recalibrate your tone. I think that's what we saw from the two different tweets about protesters. One going after them and then one saying I love to see passionate people expressing their belief. That to me was a good indication that someone talked to him and said words matter more now, but the fact is, he still does have control of his Twitter. And there doesn't seem to be anyone who's sitting with him this morning. So I still think it is an open question of how he behaves and if he does realize that there are millions and millions of people following him there. And there already even more once he takes over the POTUS Twitter handle.TAPPER: This is a silly question on its face but I actually mean it very seriously. Do you think that -- I mean, obviously there were tweets sent out under his name by him and there are ones sent out by his campaign, you can actually tell ones were which by which device it was sent by.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes.TAPPER: Do you think it is up to Kellyanne Conway or whomever in his inner circle to change his password so he no longer has access to his Twitter feed?HENDERSON: You would hope something like that happens. I don't even know the way in which he tweets if he's just firing them off, dictating them to somebody else who fires them off but this is going to be a problem.Primarily because Donald Trump has made the best argument for why he should keep tweeting in the same way, and that is, oh, he won. And it didn't harm him throughout the primaries. It didn't harm him in the general election. He actually believes it's helped him.And I also think, if you look at the people who support Donald Trump, they like that bombast. They like that rhetoric. That -- they like the fact that he isn't some sort of P.C. blow-dried politician. So in that way, I think it's going to be hard to rest some of the -- not only the Twitter account from him, but the way he engages with the public, the way he engages with the media, the way he engages with his own party and the folk that he is doesn't like, whether it's Ted Cruz or Ted Cruz or Ted Cruz's wife or whoever. I think this is going to be an issue and I'm not so sure that it's going to be -- we see another Donald Trump once he assumes the office.TAPPER: Sara, we were talking before the show about how the Trump people are constantly trying to act as though he didn't propose banning all Muslims from entering the United States until a total complete shutdown until we figure out just what the hell is going on.You heard Mayor Giuliani say that he basically walked that back although as you know he expanded it -- he described it as an expansion. Take a listen to what Mr. Trump -- president-elect Trump had to say about the issue just a few days ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE REPORTER: Are you going to ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country?TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: So where is this policy?MURRAY: That's a great question. I think this is going to be a question for a lot of Donald Trump's policies. Because we put a lot out there on the campaign trail. That he didn't necessarily flush out entirely and that he sort of walked back at points and then doubled down at points. That's what we saw with the Muslim ban.The last thing we heard from Donald Trump was that when he talked about extreme vetting which at times included a religious test that to him was an expansion of the Muslim ban. But I think we saw the same thing when you talked to Paul Ryan about the notion of a deportation force and Donald Trump on a deportation force. Maybe they're not calling it a deportation force anymore. Maybe that's not what Donald Trump's calling it. Maybe that's not what House Speaker Paul Ryan is calling it.But he has called for 5,000 additional border control agents. He has called for tripling the number of ICE officers. So there is certainly some sort of bolstering of these forces that would allow for increased deportation which is something Donald Trump promised.[09:35:01]But I think everyone is kind of waiting to see how these things Donald Trump talks about on the campaign trail will turn into actual policy when he's in the White House and when he's dealing with Capitol Hill.TAPPER: There does seem to be, Sean, a certain degree of people who are within the Trump orbit acting as though he didn't make certain proposals during the campaign that are on videotape or on the Donald J. Trump website. I mean, why is it an unreasonable question to ask if the Muslim ban is actually going to happen or a deportation --(CROSSTALK)SPICER: It's not unreasonable question.But I think that there's going to be a time between now and January 20th where he will assemble a team and his priorities of how he's going to get things done. He's got to work with Congress. And I think those conversations that started the other day have to continue in terms of this isn't a dictatorship. This is democracy. We have to work with the House and the Senate. He will continue his discussions with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell to layout the priorities of the sequencing but then also the exact -- the details of those policies.TAPPER: Congressman Becerra, we talked -- I talked to you on the beginning of the show with Speaker Ryan about the fears that many Americans feel.You represent a district with a large Latino population in California. What are people feeling in your district?BECERRA: I've heard everything from kids afraid to go to school because they're not sure their parents will be home when they get there. I've heard some families talk about not going to work. I've heard some people afraid to walk the streets because they may look like they're Muslim. I've heard everything and there is a great deal of apprehension.Be a great time right now. This is a prime time now for Donald Trump. It would be great time for him to get out there and say some words that would calm people to make sure that everyone feels comfortable going out. Whether it's to demonstrate civilly or whether it's just to go to school, but this is prime time now. And Donald Trump's words will make a big difference because so much of his talk during the campaign was so harsh and for many people, frightening.TAPPER: And Nia-Malika, take a look at this. This is from York, Pennsylvania, where students were caught on camera holding a Trump sign while another student shouted, white power.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: White power. White power. White power.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So that's a -- I don't know if that's a vine. It's a loop of some sort. But in any case, there's an investigation going on there, minority students have said they experienced more harassment since this election started.Now as I mentioned at the top of the show, there has also been violence against Trump supporters. But in the schools of America anecdotally it seems to be a lot of this. Do you think that president-elect Trump and in addition, perhaps even President Obama and Hillary Clinton have an obligation to come out and try to calm things?HENDERSON: I think they do.You heard some of that from Donald Trump in his Wednesday morning address when he talked about binding America's wounds. And you've heard that from also Paul Ryan talking about the Republican Party being the party of Lincoln and being and inclusive party.I do think it's incumbent on Donald Trump to shift his rhetoric, to continue the rhetoric about unity. I do think he probably has a steeper heel to climb. Because I think just plainly, there are a lot of Americans who think that Donald Trump is a bigot and they don't think he's a bigot because they have any sort of prejudged notions about a Republican president, they think that because of some of the things he said during the campaign.So the question is, can he give a sort of Bob Dole speech, the kind of speech he gave in the 1996 convention where he said, we're not a party of racists, talking about Republicans. Can he give that speech? And will people believe him? I think that's the question.You know, I've heard from friends too. I've got a friend who's a middle school teacher. He said the Latino students were lined up at his door on Wednesday morning. Some of them weren't even his students. And they were incredibly afraid about what this president, he would look like, and what it would mean for them and their families.TAPPER: Big challenge for president-elect Trump going forward. Thank you so much one and all.Coming up protests against Donald Trump's election continue across the country this weekend. On the frontlines at Trump Tower, Michael Moore who predicted a Trump win. He'll be here live, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:43:16]TAPPER: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper.In the days since her defeat by Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has been pretty busy. She was spotted walking her dog in the woods of Chappaqua. She handed out thousands of red roses to her campaign staff to thank them. And she at least partially pinned the blame for her loss on the FBI director.Clinton telling donors on a conference call yesterday that the first letter released by Director Comey stopped the momentum she had built after the debates and the release of Trump's Access Hollywood tape. And that it was too much for her to overcome.Let's talk about that and much more with filmmaker Michael Moore who tried to warn his fellow Democrats of a Trump win on this show, on his blog and elsewhere.Thanks so much for joining us, MichaelMICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Thanks for having me, Jake.TAPPER: So what do you make of Hillary Clinton telling donors on Saturday that FBI Director Comey is at least largely to blame for her loss? Do you agree? Is she is in denial, what's your take?MOORE: I think it's part of it, absolutely. And I would -- I've actually called upon President Obama to appoint a special prosecutor, as soon as possible, to investigate how it is that the FBI director was able to interfere with an election, which I believe is not legal and help to tip the balance in what was going to be a very close election. I think that not only should people speak about it, it needs to be investigated.TAPPER: But, let's talk about one of the other weaknesses clearly of her campaign which you were talking about months ago which is the fact that there wasn't really any sort of direct economic outreach or plan to working class white voters in places like Michigan where you're from.Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania telling the ""New York Times"" that the Clinton campaign failed to spread its best resources outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[09:45:04]He wanted the Clinton campaign doing more in the rural white pockets of the state saying quote, ""We had the resources to do both. The campaign -- and this was coming from her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn -- didn't want to do it.""Do you think that this is also a large part of what happened?MOORE: Yes. I think that also is part of it.I think how many months was it before she hadn't been to Wisconsin? I know she hadn't been to Michigan. There was a rush trip at the end there to Grand Rapids.But, you know, I mean, where I come from -- I live in Michigan, so we're used to both parties. The Republican Party, which controls the state House and the governor in Michigan has contributed to poisoning the people of Flint and still hasn't fixed the problem. So we're used to the treatment of that party.We're also used to the neglect, the benign neglect from Democrats or I should say the old school Democrats who basically -- once they get in have a hard time dealing with, especially cities that have large minority populations or in the cases of say Flint or Detroit, these are majority black cities and they largely go ignored (ph). They get a lot of lip service.And the funny thing is that Donald Trump kind of saw that and made that point, even though he will be the last person to visit Detroit or Flint to help us. And I think that the people that voted for him in Michigan are going to again be up for another rude awakening when they realize he's going to not do a damn thing to make the situation better and probably will make it worse.TAPPER: Obviously a lot of people who supported Hillary Clinton are trying to deal with this new world order. Oprah Winfrey, for example, making headlines angering a lot of Clinton supporters with comments that she made about Trump and Obama.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OPRAH WINFREY, TALK SHOW HOST: I just saw president-elect Trump with president Obama in the White House, and it gave me hope.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.WINFREY: It gave me hope. I mean, I have to say, just to hear president-elect Trump say that he had respect for President Obama, it felt that he had reached a moment where he was actually humbled by that experience. I think everybody can take a deep breath.(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: What do you think?MOORE: Well, that's why we love Oprah.Somebody needs to say that. We do need hope. I was hope. I was hopeful when I saw the two of them there because Trump looked like he didn't belong there. And he felt so uncomfortable in his own skin sitting there in that chair, you know, just like -- and Obama, I think we counted 15 o 16 ums as he was trying say something nice.Look, that's the side show that has to happen in a week like this. But frankly, you know, Democrats would be better off if they ran Oprah or Tom Hanks or -- why don't we run beloved people? We have so many of them.The Republicans do this. They run Reagan and the terminator and other people. Why don't we, why don't we run somebody that the American people love? That they are really drawn to and they're smart and have good politics and all that. Why don't Democrats do that?I'm telling you, Jake, my sincere hope is that the DNC that there is a clean sweep in this party. They all have to go, and they have to make room for the progressive Democrats who are going to come in here, are going to be needed to fight the things that Trump is going to do to the people of this country and the world. And we need young people, and women, and others who are going to really be the voice of this party.Not the same old, same old -- clearly people wanted change. I think everybody has admitted that and clearly Bernie Sanders represented that. And you know, I was -- I was at the demonstration yesterday and there were Trump people there on the sidewalk. And I went over and talked to them and I said, you know, would you have considered voting for Bernie Sanders? And they said yes, they were just mad at the system.TAPPER: Well let me ask you this, so that's the big question, what did Democrats do going forward organizationally, do they double down on progressive views the kind espoused by Bernie Sanders? Do they try to reach out to somebody who understands the working class white voters that voted for Donald Trump in droves? A fight already under way for the DNC chair. Several people have put their names forward including Howard Dean, Martin O'Malley, Congressman Keith Ellison who has the support of Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer.Who do you think the party should go with?MOORE: Keith Ellison. That is the exact way to go. That is the future.[09:50:01]We live -- we live -- the fear that I think a lot of white voters have is that they know the truth, which is that as the census bureau says, before 2050, white people are going to be the minority in this country. MOORE: For the last two Septembers now, the majority of kindergartners entering school in America are not white. That's the new America and we need to have a party that's going to represent the majority here that's in the future and not the past.TAPPER: All right.MOORE: So I hope that that happens. But people need to be out in the streets and not -- it's not just about the white working class. Right now all white people need to be concerned about how afraid Muslims, African-Americans, Hispanics are right now.TAPPER: I need to cut you off, I'm sorry.MOORE: I know. I'm so sorry. No, no. I just wanted to make that appeal because...TAPPER: OK.MOORE: ... I worry about what's ahead.TAPPER: A lot of people out there are very worried. Donald Trump -- thank you so much, Michael Moore. We appreciate it.MOORE: Thank you.TAPPER: Donald Trump spent the last year and a half running an unconventional campaign. Should we expect the same from his inauguration. The pump (ph), the circumstance, the ""State of the Cartoonion"" coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:55:12]TAPPER: Welcome back. President-elect Trump is preparing for the Oval Office and his inauguration, so what should we expect when he takes the oath? It's the subject of this week's ""State of the Cartoonion.""(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER (voice-over): As the returns came in, election night, the nation began trying to envision just what a Trump presidency might look like.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations, Mr. President.TAPPER: Sixty-eight days from now, after all, Mr. Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America. Now, you can bet that Beyonce will not be there serenading him on the steps of the Capitol as she did back in 2013.TRUMP: I don't need Beyonce.TAPPER: You're more likely, in fact, to see Trump supporter Ted Nugent.TED NUGENT, MUSICIAN: I've got your blue state right here, baby.TAPPER: The fact that the inaugural parade usually heads straight down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House means the president-elect will march right by his new Trump hotel. It's already sold out for inauguration day as the hotel website promises ""Washington will never be the same.""(END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Thanks for watching.""FAREED ZAKARIA GPS"" is next."	0
"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can’t believe I’m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I’m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn’t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder."	1

“Grey’s Anatomy” stars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew are leaving the ABC drama, Variety has confirmed. The two actors will depart at the end of the show’s current and 14th season.  “The characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey’s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,” said executive producer Krista Vernof. “As writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.”  “It’s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.”  Capshaw and Drew’s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season. Rhimes last year signed an overall deal with Netflix worth $100 million, that takes her away from her longtime home at ABC Studios, which produces “Grey’s Anatomy.”  Deadline first reported the departures.	0

He’ll persevere through the witch hunt and I will do what I can to make his journey easier.”Eastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest:“We’ll be able to sit up there, far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state and the deep levels of corruption still inside the Justice department and FBI, and strategize without worrying about being called before a federal prosecutor for it.”Clint Eastwood will be remembered for a lot of things after he’s gone, but this may be the biggest.

Users rebel against social media app’s new features while celebrities dump platform as it tries to appeal to new users  More than $1bn was wiped off Snap Inc’s market value on Thursday, in one of the company’s worst trading days since it went public last year – and the rout was led by a bored tweet from a member of the Kardashian clan.  Kylie Jenner, one of the first wave of celebrities whose fame grew primarily on Snapchat over other social media firms, shared her disappointment with the app on Twitter late on Wednesday: “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me ... ugh this is so sad,” she said. “[S]till love you tho snap ... my first love”.  Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad.  Jenner’s tweet, combined with growing fears on the part of investors that a long-awaited usability-focused redesign may not solve Snapchat’s user growth issues, sparked a plunge in the company’s stock, which fell 6% over the course of Thursday, clearing $1.3bn from its market capitalisation.  The redesign of the app saw Snapchat move away from its previous split between “messages” and “stories”, the social media convention invented by the company but usurped by Facebook’s Instagram. Now, Snapchat focuses attention on the division between friends and publishers, allowing it to more easily promote professional (and paid-for) content, while grouping everything from actual acquaintances in one place.  But it isn’t just Snapchat’s celebrity users and investors who have expressed frustration with the new direction the app has taken. A petition from more than 1.2 million users begged the company to reconsider its redesign, eventually forcing a somewhat dismissive response from Snap Inc itself.  “We completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many,” the company said. However, it added, “this new foundation is just the beginning and we will always listen closely to find new ways to make the service better for everyone”.    The petition’s core complaint is that the new update “has not made the app easier to use, but has in fact made many features more difficult … Many ‘new features’ are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years.”  In the run up to the redesign, the company’s co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel promised it would satisfy concerns (particularly among investors) that Snapchat was too difficult to use. But he also hoped that the redesign could help fix some common problems faced by all social media apps, he told the Guardian before the launch.  “For a very long time, we have been trying to clarify, or at least distinguish, the difference between friends and publishers,” Spiegel said in November. “Like, on the Stories page, do you show friends or publishers first? Because our service was really built on this idea of helping friends communicate, we chose friends – and ultimately what that meant is that all of this awesome publisher content was all the way down at the bottom.”  Despite the criticism, Spiegel remains characteristically bolshy about the new design, telling a conference in San Francisco that “some of the complaints we’re seeing reinforce the philosophy.    “One of the complaints we got was, ‘wow I used to feel like this celebrity was my friend and now they don’t feel like my friend anymore’. And we’re like: ‘Exactly. They’re not your friend.’ So for us, even some of the frustrations we’re seeing really validate those changes. And it’ll take time for people to adjust.”	0

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Looking back at things Meghan Markle has said and done in her life so far, it seems that she was always destined for royalty.  She's always showed thoughtfulness, grace and intelligence - from campaigning against a sexist ad when she was just 11 years old to the humanitarian work she's been passionate about long before she married Prince Harry.  There's so much talk about the Duchess of Sussex every day, but what has she actually said about herself?  As she celebrates her 37th birthday this weekend, here's what Meghan has said on some of the most important things in her life - in her own words.  On happiness and self-acceptance  On her 33rd birthday Meghan wrote on her website The Tig about the ways she struggled with the idea of fitting in - before she realised it's important to be kind and accept yourself as you are.  ""I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.  ""My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as ""whatever"" as everyone else. My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  "" You need to know that you’re enough [is a] mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  ""So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself.""  On her relationship with Harry  In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2016, Meghan spoke about her blossoming relationship with Prince Harry.  She said: ""We’re a couple... We’re in love.  ""I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.""  On the proposal  (Image: Getty)  In Meghan and Harry's first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.  ""Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, 'Can I say yes now?!'""  On feminism  In her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it:  ""I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’.  ""Two boys from my class said, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong, in the kitchen’.  ""I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt; it just wasn't right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of.""  ""It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision — because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together.""  On her humanitarian work  (Image: PA)  In 2016, Meghan wrote on The Tig about how she feels she can't not do humanitarian work - particularly with the responsibility of someone in the entertainment industry who is looked up to.  ""I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.""  On the Queen  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  In the royal couple's engagement interview on the BBC in November 2017, Meghan spoke about how she has the utmost respect for Harry's grandmother.  ""To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother… all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her, I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her … She's an incredible woman."""	1
Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova have been so secretive about their relationship that fans have often wondered if they’re even still together.  But on Monday, the couple put any split rumors to rest after news broke they reportedly welcomed twins — a boy and a girl — over the weekend.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Here’s a look back at their private romance:  2001  The singer, 42, and the former tennis pro, 36, first met when she starred in her future boyfriend’s sexy music video for “Escape.” Sparks flew on set and they began dating shortly after shooting the video, which features Kournikova initially rebuffing his advances. The duo later make out and get hands-y in the bathroom on the sink.  2002  The couple weren’t always so secretive about their relationship. After making their official debut as a couple on the red carpet of the MTV Video Music Awards in 2002, they also coupled up a year later at the Once Upon a Time in Mexico premiere in New York City.  Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias Bill Davila/FilmMagic  In true turn of the century fashion, Kournikova showed off rock-hard abs in an all-white belly-baring ensemble with strappy heels while Enrique wore distressed flared denim jeans and a black dress shirt paired with a T-shirt.  2004  The rumor mill went into overdrive about a possible engagement — or wedding — when Kournikova stepped onto the court at the World Team Tennis match with a blindingly large pink diamond ring on her ring finger. She later sported a simple band while out and about.  Anna Kournikova Jason Squires/WireImage  Reports circulated the duo had wed in a secret ceremony in Puerto Vallarta, but sources told PEOPLE at the time the rumors were false.  2006 – 2012  The pair appeared to be going strong for nearly a decade.  In 2006, they sat front and center at the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Miami Heat game in Miami, posed for photos at Big Pink restaurant and capped off the year with a date at Mauro’s Cafe in December.  Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova Issac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty  And the next year, Kournikova was photographed goofing around in a bikini with Iglesias while they prepared to board a boat in Miami. In December, they jetted to London and once again fueled wedding rumors when Kournikova was snapped with yet another plain band on her ring finger.  Iglesias fueled breakup rumors when he told a Swedish newspaper that the duo had been secretly married but were “now” divorced. “We’re divorced. I am single now, but that’s okay,” he told Aftonbladet. “I don’t mind being alone.”  However, a Kournikova pal told PEOPLE Iglesias was joking, and his rep also confirmed the duo were “still together.”  In 2008, Kournikova told PEOPLE she was “never getting married” but added that “everything is good” between her and Iglesias. Days later, the singer told reporters he had been trying to get his girlfriend to marry him for years. “I always try, but she pays me no attention,” he said as he arrived in the Dominican Republic for a series of concerts.  Though they didn’t attend many public events together for the rest of the decade, the duo were photographed going on dinner dates and vacationing in St. Barts.  The former tennis champ also opened up about hopefully becoming a mother in the future in a 2011 interview with Women’s Health. “I absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt,” she told the mag. “I love taking care of people.”  In a 2012 interview with Parade, Iglesias reiterated the duo had no plans to wed. “I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference,” he told the outlet. “Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love somebody more because of a piece of paper.”  2013 – 2014  In late 2013, reports surfaced that the longtime couple had called it quits. But after the new year, they were photographed spending quality time together on a boat in Miami.  Then in 2014, Iglesias shocked fans by again claiming he and Kournikova had divorced. “I got a divorce three days ago and I wanted to give you guys the exclusive. I’m serious. No, seriously. Don’t laugh,” he told reporters ahead of a performance at the Staples Center that October.  2016  Kournikova proved all was well in 2016 when she posted a photo of her and Iglesias with her brother Allan on her Instagram account.  Over the last few years, Kournikova also began sporting another massive ring — perhaps a yellow diamond? — complete with a matching diamond band.  2017  Sixteen years after they first met, Iglesias and Kournikova reportedly became parents over the weekend. According to TMZ, the couple welcomed a boy and a girl named Nicholas and Lucy. Reps for the musician and athlete did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  “I think she’d be a perfect mother,” Iglesias once told PEOPLE en Español in 2007.	0
"Robert Pattinson on 'Twilight' Experience: 'It's All Fond Memories'  Email Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin  It looks like Robert Pattinson is looking back at his ""Twilight"" experience with a positive light.  On Monday, Robert Pattinson was in attendance for the 27th Annual IFP Gotham Awards in New York City where he was nominated for his new film ""Good Time."" But before he headed straight for the prestigious event, the 31-year-old actor lounged around the red carpet and dished about his experiences with an entirely different film: The ""Twilight"" saga.  It had been five years since the final ""Twilight"" film had been released, ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part Two,"" and in an interview with E! News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how ""amazing"" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.  ""It's all fond memories,"" Pattinson remarked about filming the ""Twilight"" movies. ""I mean it's almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it's just such a magical way to spend your 20s.""  ""I mean it's completely crazy. I still haven't really processed it. I mean I always thought that there'd be more of a fallout—a psychological fallout years later,"" the actor adds.  His remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow ""Twilight"" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise. In fact, she was actually surprised that so much time had already gone by since they filmed the last ""Twilight"" film. Stewart had also shared how lucky she was to have been part of such an experience and that she has taken a lot from the franchise going so far as to say that the film series has made her what she is today.  Based on the popular novel series by Stephenie Meyer, the first ""Twilight"" film was released in 2008 and was an instant success spanning five films and grossing over $3 billion all in all."	0
Adam Scott just got the belated birthday surprise of a lifetime.  Scott made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday where he discussed his love of Star Wars with guest host Kristen Bell in honor of May the Fourth — national Star Wars Day. The Parks and Rec alum revealed that he once invited Mark Hamill to his childhood birthday party.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I remember everything around that whole season around when Empire Strikes Back came out,” Scott reminisced, “and so I wrote him a letter inviting him to my birthday party.”  When asked if he thought Hamill would really show up, Scott replied with a confident “I did.”  “I thought if he got it and he was able to — if his schedule was clear, he was probably going to come,” he said.  But sadly, Hamill was a no-show.  “He didn’t show up and I remember not being crushed or anything,” said Scott. “It was fine. I knew he must’ve been incredibly busy.”  Before he could continue his story, Scott was interrupted by blaring horns as the orchestral theme to Star Wars came over the speaker. And this is where his childhood dreams finally came true.  Wielding a bright green lightsaber, Hamill made his way onto the stage.  “No way,” Scott said while in a state of shock.  Hamill greeted the Star Wars superfan with a late birthday gift in the form of a lightsaber and apologized for his absence at Scott’s childhood party.  “I’m sorry I missed your birthday,” Hamill said. “I was checking my diary and that week I had two other birthdays, a Bar Mitzvah, and a supermarket opening!”  Still practically speechless, Scott confirmed that “this really is one of the moments of my life.”	0
Ellen DeGeneres — after a fight to end all fights that climaxed with Ellen ripping off her wedding ring — has fled the marital home she shares with Portia de Rossi , and multiple sources have claimed the stage is set for a blockbuster $400 million divorce! Photo credit: Getty Images/InStar  The National ENQUIRER has learned Ellen left In a bombshell world exclusive,has learned Ellen left the couple’s love nest and has agreed to an off-listing sale of the marital estate they bought together just eight months ago! Photo credit: Mega  “It’s all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,” an insider claimed. “She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty .” Photo credit: Mega  Ellen has publicly insisted the couple’s marriage is on solid ground. But sources have exclusively told The ENQUIRER the pair have been spending nights alone, and now they appear to be living completely apart. Photo credit: Mega  Property records show Ellen and Portia — who will be married for ten years on Aug. 16 — maintained two separate residences on the six-acre equestrian estate in exclusive Montecito, Calif., which recently sold for $11 million. Photo credit: Files  In yet another clue to their marital woes , just weeks after they paid $7.2 million for the sprawling property last September, Ellen quietly snapped up a place of her own nine miles away in Carpinteria! Photo credit: Files  Sources claimed the $77 million-a-year TV chatterbox is holed up at this $18.6 million beachfront mansion, which she secretly purchased in October 2017. “It didn’t bode well for the long term when Ellen bought that home,” a source claimed. Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up. But according to sources, her recent spree is less about the money and more about having separate residences as she and Portia inch closer toward officially separating. Photo credit: Mega  “They spend less and less time together ,” said one source. “In fact, they’ve been living separate lives. It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider. Photo credit: Mega  “The idea of going through that mess is probably the glue that’s kept them together this long!” A sour-faced Ellen was pictured without her wedding ring during a Beverly Hills shopping spree on April 20. At the time, talk heated up that her high-profile union was under pressure. Photo credit: Mega  But in the days that followed, she and Portia paraded their “happy” marriage in front of paparazzi at multiple Hollywood hot spots, usually arm in arm and sporting painful smiles. “Nobody is convinced,” a source said. “They aren’t intimate!” Photo credit: Mega  While a friend of Ellen’s brushed off talk of divorce, the couple’s marriage has exploded many times before, according to inside sources. But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source.

Rob Kardashian took to Instagram last week to share his story of the messy split between himself and popular model/reality tv star Blac Chyna. He also revealed some secrets and explicit photos of the model online.  ABC’s Nightline aired an interview with the model and she explained how she felt when her estranged partner shared her nude pictures on Instagram.  “I was devastated. I’m looking at this and I’m like, ‘How could someone do this to me?'” she confessed. “I was very fearful because I was like, ‘If you could do this, what else could you do?'”  Chyna stood up for herself saying that her past as a stripper is irrelevant. “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,”.  “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,” She told Good Morning America.  When she sent the photos to Rob, she did not consent to him posting or sharing for others to see. “The moral of the story is, like, he doesn’t respect me,” she said. “So if you can’t respect me, you have to respect the law.” In the interview, Chyna also repeated new claims of Rob being physically violent with her and making multiple suicide threats over the past few months. “Rob has hit me before. Yes, this was in April.”He threatened to kill himself multiple times in text messages since we broke up in December 2016, trying to manipulate me to respond to his outbursts. I have been telling Rob to get help and go to therapy since June 2016. To my knowledge, Rob has not seen a licensed therapist.”I am in fear of this angry, volatile, vindictive man, who has physically attacked me and tried to humiliate me so publicly. I am embarrassed by his posts. I ask for orders of protection so that I can live my life in peace and free of fear of him.” After the interview was recorded, Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob. Another court date has been scheduled for August.In spite of the troubles, Chyna hoped to work things out with Rob for the sake of their 8-month old daughter Dream Kardashian.	0
While everyone was listening, he was flirting!  Kanye West threw a party and invited everybody who was somebody to listen to his new “Ye” album in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week. And despite wifey Kim Kardashian being in attendance, Kanye’s attention was on a different woman, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.  Insider claim Kanye, 40, has a thing for Trump supporter and conservative activist Candace Owens. The “New Slaves” rapper boldly professed how much he loves the way she thinks in a Twitter post on Apr. 21 and at his listening party, which he invited her to, his actions showed he loved much more her intelligence.  I love the way Candace Owens thinks — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 21, 2018  “They were touchy feeling and it looked like they’re more than friends,” an onlooker told Radar of their interaction. “‘Ye was showing Candace off to everybody, introducing her as his best friend.  “He complemented her on her beauty and brains, telling people she could be our first female president,” the source claimed. “They were flirting, laughing and smiling in each other’s face. They had crazy chemistry.”  The source indicated that Kim, 37, was oblivious to her husband swooning over Candace and thinks the reality television star should pay closer attention.  PHOTOS: In The Dark! Kim Shields Kids From Kanye West’s Crisis  “When ‘Ye wasn’t with her, he was with Candace,” the source added. “If Kim knew what’s best, she’d keep Kanye away from Candace.”  As Radar previously reported exclusively, there’s some serious tension between the A-List couple. Kanye’s erratic behavior as of late is driving Kim insane.  “Kim thinks that divorce may be her only option to save herself and her children right now,” another source told Radar. “She’s been having a breakdown herself over all of this, and has been crying to her mom and her sisters all week long!”  We pay for juicy info!

Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Julie Pennell  Talk about organization goals. We’ve already oohed and ahhed at Gwyneth Paltrow’s ultraorganized pantry, but now we’re ogling her playroom, which features the most beautiful rainbow color scheme.  The Oscar-winning actress and Goop CEO enlisted Nashville-based organization service The Home Edit to help her get her Hamptons home in order.  thehomeedit/Instagram/NBC  They were the ones who did the now-famous pantry, and recently shared snaps of the gorgeous playroom.  “We just spent the most INCREDIBLE few days at @gwynethpaltrow's Hamptons house,” they posted on Instagram. “Our favorite project from the trip (and of all time) was the playroom.”  The room features two walls of bookshelves with activities (like board games and a globe) on the left and leisure (like books and plush animals) on the right. To organize it even more, they created zones for reading, games, art, crafts and science.  “We categorized books and stuffed animals by color so that everything is easy to find (not to mention pretty to look at),” they added. The result is a beautiful crisp white room with strategically placed pops of color. We just wonder how long the meticulous organization will actually last once a kid gets into it.  Paltrow’s children, Apple and Moses, are 13 and 11 respectively, so perhaps they’ll be a little more tidy than, say, a toddler might be.  Feeling inspired to make your own playroom this gorgeous?

Slow your roll ‘Baywatch’ fans. Alexandra Daddario is squashing claims that she’s loved up with costar Zac Efron.  Alexandra Daddario, 32, wants to make something very clear: She’s not dating Zac Efron. Yes, he was her love interest in the 2017 Baywatch film but the actress claims that, in real life, they’re just “good friends.” Alexandra clarified their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE. Crushing the hopes of Baywatch fans everywhere, she said on May 31, “We’re very good friends. Zac and I’ve worked together, and we’re very good friends.”  It’s not the first time that Alexandra has claimed that Zac, 30, is in the friendship zone. In May 2017, she told E! News, “We work together closely; he’s my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.” So, what happened? Alexandra’s comments don’t match what HollywoodLife and other outlets have been told about the status of her relationship with Zac. In April a source EXCLUSIVELY told us that the actress has been “very coy” about their rumored romance. The person added, “But people that are close to her know that this a defense mechanism because she really wants it to work and doesn’t want anything to get in the way of a great love match. She wants to make it look like she is single in public but is 100 percent all about Zac and the relationship they are brewing.”  If we take Alexandra at her word, she and Zac have definitely – at the very least – formed their own mutual admiration society. On March 16, he posted a tribute to the actress on his Instagram page. Next to a photo of them together, he wished her a “Happy Birthday” calling her the, “most real, down to earth, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving and most rare Pokemon ever created.” And on April 4, when Alexandra posted a photo of her looking at her dog on Instagram, he commented, “Two hot b*tches.” Because, with flirting like that, of course people wouldn’t think they’re dating. Right?	1
For the Iraqi minister, see Mohammed Hadid  Mohamed Anwar Hadid (Arabic: محمد حديد‎; born 6 November[5] 1948)[6] is a Jordanian-American real estate developer of Palestinian origin. He is known for building luxury hotels and mansions, mainly in the Bel Air neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles County, California.  Early life  Mohamed Anwar Hadid is a Palestinian[7][8][9][10][11] born in Nazareth[1] in November 1948, to a Muslim family. He is the son of Anwar Hadid (c. 1908 – 1979) and his wife Khairiah.[12] Through his mother he claims descent from Daher Al Omer, Prince of Nazareth and the Sheik of Galilee.[13][14] Hadid has two brothers and five sisters.[12]  His father, Anwar Hadid studied at a Jerusalem teachers' college and attended a university[which?] in Syria to study law, before working in land settlement for the British authorities and teaching English at a teachers' college in Mandatory Palestine. In 1948, he moved to Syria and joined the United States Information Agency and the Voice of America. He and his family lived in Damascus, Tunisia, and Greece before moving to Washington D.C., as Anwar had a job at the VOA headquarters there, when Mohamed was 14, and spent the rest of his career there with VOA and USIA as a writer, editor and translator.[12][13][15]  Hadid attended North Carolina State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[1]  Career  Among his early ventures was a company that exported equipment to the Middle East.[6][16] He started his career restoring and reselling classic cars in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., before moving to Greece where he opened a nightclub on an island, and with the profits, started developing real estate back in the United States.[17]  In the 1980s, much of his financial clout came from the SAAR Foundation, a Herndon-based foundation with Saudi roots. The foundation was a 50-50 partner in many of Hadid's ventures.[16] In the late 1980s, he faced at least 30 lawsuits from creditors and banks claiming he had not fulfilled various financial obligations.[18] He paid $150 million for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and New York. He also converted a Houston hotel into a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and developed a Ritz-Carlton resort in Scottsdale, Arizona. He outmaneuvered Donald Trump, paid $42.9 million for several choice parcels in Aspen and announced plans for a 292-room Ritz resort.[16][18]  In 1992, a settlement was reached in a lawsuit by Riggs Bank against Columbia First Bank Chairman Melvin Lenkin, a Hadid partner in a Washington, D.C., construction project that involved a loan on which Hadid defaulted. Following the settlement Hadid closed his local office, lost his McLean home to foreclosure, and left the Washington area.[19]  He developed Le Belvedere, a mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles,[20] that sold for $50 million in 2010. In 2012, he developed The Crescent Palace, a 48,000-square-foot home on an acre plot next door to the Beverly Hills Hotel, which he listed for sale at $58 million.[21]  Shortly after Hadid received approval for the construction of a mansion in Bel Air, the Bel Air Homeowners Alliance, chaired by Fred Rosen, was formed to oppose it.[20] In January 2015, Nancy Walton Laurie, an heiress to the Walmart fortune and a Bel Air resident, filed a lawsuit through her company, LW Partnership, against Hadid.[22] Laurie accused Hadid of damaging the roots of a eucalyptus tree on her property with a retaining wall he built next to her house.[22]  In December 2015, the Los Angeles city council voted to pursue criminal charges over a claim that Hadid violated local zoning laws. The council alleged he built his house contrary to multiple planning orders and made it twice the permitted size.[23][24] In May 2017, Hadid pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges stemming from mansion-construction issues for which he did not receive city approval, and was sentenced that July to community service and fines.[25][26]  In July 2017, he was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, summoned to return $14,191 to the City of Los Angeles in damages, and fined $3,000.[27] He was also given a three-year probation period to ensure the property would comply with existing regulations, or he would face a 180-day jail sentence.[27]  Athletic career  Hadid competed in the demonstration sport of speed skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics, representing Jordan. He was 43 years old at the time. Hadid was encouraged to participate by his friend, Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber. Hadid was the only member of the Jordanian delegation,[1] and remains the only person to have represented Jordan in the Winter Olympics.[28][29]  Television appearances  Hadid has appeared on the TV show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, as the ex-husband of Yolanda Hadid.[21] He has also appeared on Shahs of Sunset.,[20] and Second Wives Club on E! with his fiancée Shiva Safai in 2017[30].  Personal life  His first wife was Mary Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Alana Hadid and Marielle Hadid. He and Butler ended their marriage in 1992.[31][32]  From 1994 until their divorce in 2000, he was married to the Dutch model Yolanda Hadid, née Van den Herik.[33] They had three children, who all became models: Gigi (born 1995), Bella (born 1996),[32] and Anwar (born 1999).[34]  As of 2014, Hadid is engaged to Shiva Safai, a model and businesswoman. She was born in Iran and raised in Norway, and at age 19, moved to Los Angeles with her family.[35]  Hadid is a dual Jordanian-American citizen.[1] He does not consider himself a devout Muslim,[14] but has never drunk alcohol, although he does have a 5,000-bottle wine cellar, including some from his own Beverly Hills winery.[17]  In 2017, his fiancée, Shiva Safai, who is 33 years his junior, began to appear in E! reality show, Second Wives Club.[36][37]  References  Official website	0
"There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments."	1
"Mariah Carey is not having a ""midlife crisis"", despite a manufactured tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We're told it's ""not true"".    The allegation comes from OK!, which claims the singer was ""partying with a crowd"" that was ""half her age"" at Catch restaurant in Los Angeles last month. A so-called ""source"" tells the outlet, ""She clearly thought she was the hippest, coolest person there, when in reality everyone was rolling their eyes."" Carey is ""regressing"", further purports the magazine's supposed insider, adding that she has recruited a group of ""young girlfriends"" and is picking up ""boy toys"" in an attempt to ""fill a void"".    But Gossip Cop investigated, and a rep for the singer exclusively assures us the entire report is ""not true"". Carey, despite having recently separated from Bryan Tanaka, is not going through a ""midlife crisis"", and any claims made otherwise are simply false. What's more, we're further told the star is currently at the ""top of her game"". From the number of inaccurate stories that OK! is pumping out, it's clear that the tabloid is in a state of crisis, not Carey.    Unfortunately, we're not remotely surprised by the outlet's latest piece of fiction. In March, Gossip Cop corrected the magazine for falsely alleging Carey and Nick Cannon argued at Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards. And shortly before that bogus tale, we debunked the publication for wrongly claiming Carey and Lionel Richie were feuding over their joint tour. There was no truth to those stories, and the same goes for this one.    (Gossip Cop)"	1

It looks like Tyga’s days on Kanye West’s record label may be numbered, as HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned Kim Kardashian is pressuring her husband to drop Tyga now that he and Kylie Jenner are no longer dating.  Kylie Jenner, 19, and Tyga‘s breakup is causing a major rift in the family. Scott Disick is “Team Tyga” all the way and doesn’t want to stop being friends with him. In fact, he wants to make sure Kanye West, 39, keeps Tyga, 27, on his record label so the rapper can sustain a good income. However, Kim Kardashian is “Team Kylie” and pressuring her husband to drop Tyga fast.  “Kim is pressuring her husband to move on from Tyga. Kim always had questions about Kylie’s relationship with Tyga and wishes Kanye would follow Kylie’s lead and separate ties with the struggling rapper. Kim feels like Kanye has enough stress in his life and managing her sister’s ex is something Kanye doesn’t need in his life,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  Obviously, Kanye is the head of his record label so the final decision rests with him, but if we were Tyga, we’d be worried. “His loyalty is going to be with Kylie and the family over Tyga,” another source told us. And we hear that if Kylie were to ask him to drop Tyga from his label, he’d do so in a heartbeat. “If Kylie wanted to be petty, she could probably get Kanye to drop Tyga from his label. I’m not saying she’s going to do that, I don’t think she’s that bitter. But if it came down to it and that’s what the family wanted, I’m sure Kanye wouldn’t even question it,” the source added.  HollywoodLifers, what do YOU think? Should Kanye West drop Tyga from his record label? Tell us how you feel below!	1

Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston.  Welcome to You Know What I Heard, the Cut’s weekly celebrity gossip column about the peregrinations of the rich and famous. Have gossip? Email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal (ask for the number).  When Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their breakup last Thursday evening, they did so with a joint statement issued by Aniston’s longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane. It had Jen written all over it: The statement called out the malicious “gossip industry” and insisted that “whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative.”  Since Thursday, a lot has been printed about the split, and a lot of it seems to be coming from Theroux’s friends. So who’s really running this breakup?  Sources close to Theroux in New York have been telling “Page Six” that Theroux was “really bored by [Aniston’s] whole Hollywood crowd” and that he “initiated” the separation. Unfortunately for Aniston, Official Hollywood Bible People has more or less backed up those “Page Six” reports, citing sources who say that Theroux was done with the marriage and wanted to take the breakup public ASAP.  In one report, published Sunday, a source close to Aniston told People that “Jen didn’t want to announce [the split] for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention.” But Theroux didn’t play ball. Instead, he walked around getting photographed in New York throughout Aniston’s birthday weekend, while Aniston celebrated at home with girlfriends in L.A. (We definitely noticed that last week.)  “Jen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren’t wondering why he wasn’t with her, but that’s not Justin’s style,” People’s source said. “He wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.” Theroux apparently flew to L.A. to talk to Aniston three days after her birthday (on Valentine’s Day!), and Aniston agreed to release a statement the next day.  So: Theroux initiated the breakup and took it public before Aniston was ready because … why? What life does he want to live? The Sun reported this weekend that one source of contention in his marriage to Aniston was his desire to “party” with the “New York art scene.” Specifically, Sun sources claimed that Aniston was upset over Theroux’s desire to hang out with 25-year-old photographer and “art beauty” Petra Collins.  👽👶🏼🌝🔪 A post shared by Petra Collins (@petrafcollins) on Jan 26, 2018 at 10:02am PST  The Sun tends to be more accurate when reporting on British stars (like Taylor Swift’s boyfriends), so who knows where its reporters are getting this information, but Theroux and Collins do know each other. Collins shot Theroux for a spread in L’uomo Vogue last year. The shoot took place at Paul’s Baby Grand in Tribeca; you can see it on Collins’s website.  Hypothetically, what would a Collins-Theroux romance mean for gossip? Collins isn’t just an indie darling; she’s also a collaborator and close friend of Selena Gomez. Gomez has publicly gushed, many times, about how much she loves Aniston. (They met a few years ago through their management.) Will Gomez have to pick a side?  Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston.  Another curious element in all of this: Aniston and Theroux may not be legally married at all. Though they had a surprise wedding in the back yard of Aniston’s Bel Air mansion in 2015, TMZ reported this weekend that the couple never filed for a marriage license, confidentially or otherwise, in L.A. County. And neither Aniston nor Theroux has hired a divorce lawyer.  Theroux’s friends may be talking to the tabloids, but Theroux himself is not ready to address the rumors: He backed out of a scheduled appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert tonight.  Selena Gomez, meanwhile, is reportedly in Jamaica with Justin Bieber for Bieber’s dad’s wedding. Jeremy Bieber, 42, is marrying his “longtime girlfriend” Chelsey Rebelo, 29. Here’s a photo of Gomez posing with some of Rebelo’s friends and relatives:  So Gomez and Bieber are going strong, despite her family’s disapproval. According to People, the on-again couple spent Valentine’s Day with a visit to Hillsong and a makeout at the Montage in Beverly Hills.  We haven’t heard much from Ben Affleck and his SNL-producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus so far this year, but you’ll be happy to know they are still together and still color-coordinating their outfits.  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.  According to E! News, the couple spent Valentine’s Day house-hunting in L.A. “They visited two homes in the $8 million–$10 million range with a broker who gave them tours,” a source told the site. Those homes were in the tony neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, where Affleck’s ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives with their three kids. The house tours were very romantic, apparently.  “While Ben and Lindsay were waiting for the first house to be opened, Ben grabbed Lindsay on the doorstep and pulled her in close for a hug,” E!’s source said. “They were swaying back and forth hugging and laughing. He kissed her on the forehead. He walked with his arm around her and put his hand on her lower back. They seemed very happy and close.”  Shookus can’t be planning to move to L.A. full-time, though, can she? Her daughter and ex-husband live in New York. And she has SNL. Currently, she’s living in Affleck’s $28,000-a-month rental on the Upper West Side.  One small blessing from this week:  Here is a photo of Rooney Mara and her boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix going to a mall in Sherman Oaks.  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.  Jennifer Lawrence.  Finally, I’ll leave you with this TimesTalk Jennifer Lawrence did last week to promote her new spy thriller Red Sparrow. During the talk, she said she’d like to use her character’s skills to figure out “what’s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift.”  “That’s the God’s honest truth,” she added. “[It’s] keeping me up at night.”  Love or hate J.Law, she is a great gossip. Most celebrities pretend not to pay attention to the tabloids, but she regularly brings up feuds and rumors in public conversations. (See this appearance on Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live! or her interview with Kim Kardashian West on Jimmy Kimmel’s show.) I, too, would love to know why Kloss and Swift broke up. This past weekend, Kloss attended the NBA All-Star Game with her boyfriend Josh Kushner. Before that, she was spotted hanging out with sworn-Swift-enemy Katy Perry. Swift has been hanging out with herself. Will J.Law’s comment prompt Swift to make a statement?  Thanks so much for gossiping this week.

"April the giraffe with her new baby calf shortly after she gave birth last year. (Photo: USA TODAY)  After months of questions and rumors, Animal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch announced Wednesday the news millions of worldwide giraffe fans have been waiting to hear: April the giraffe is pregnant again.  Last month, the park announced it was sending 30 days worth of fecal samples to another zoo's laboratory for progesterone testing to confirm the pregnancy, 14 months after April gave birth to her calf, Tajiri on site at the park.  Keeper Allysa Swilley had collected a fecal sample from April's stall over the course of a month. The samples were secured in plastic bags, labeled and dated before being put in freezer storage.  April is months into her pregnancy and due to give birth in early spring 2019, park officials said.  Last year, Southern Tier residents and others from around the nation and world watched, as the heavily pregnant giraffe captivated audiences on the park's live stream during the final weeks of her pregnancy.  On April 15, 2017, more than a million viewers tuned in to watch April give birth to a healthy, male calf named Tajiri.  “April’s prior pregnancy facilitated an immeasurable amount of education and appreciation for giraffes,"" Patch said in a news release. ""We’re very proud of our captive management and propagation program and eager to continue doing all we can to help bring this species awareness and tangible results towards conservation.”  Fans will once again be able to follow April's progress throughout her pregnancy on social media, the park said.

Jamie Foxx did not “betray” Katie Holmes by supposedly “getting flirty” with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It’s simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, “When Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Foxx “would reach over and touch the woman’s leg or hold her hand” throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is “headed for heartbreak,” quoting its supposed insider as saying, “She needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn’t have any real proof that Foxx got “flirty” with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman’s arm during a conversation. That’s as intimate as the two get in the images and there’s no evidence to suggest they’re anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn’t feel “betrayed” when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx’s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two “don’t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don’t want to be labeled as a couple.” It was further stressed that neither “want to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.”  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us “he knows he’s in a public forum” when he chats with other women. As we’ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx “betrayed” Holmes by “getting cozy” with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn’t feel “betrayed.” That remains the case.	1

"Today's reminder about the inequalities faced by women in the entertainment industry comes courtesy of Alison Brie . The actress, who stars in the upcoming female-centric Netflix series GLOW , recently opened up about an audition from her past that was wildly inappropriate, to say the least.  Following a screening of her new series, in which Brie plays a struggling actress who, tired of the one-dimensional roles she's usually asked to read for, is ultimately cast in a league of female wrestlers, she got real about how different working on the show was from the industry sexism characteristic of the 1980s setting it depicts—and how much of Hollywood is still pretty sexist. ""It has not changed that much,"" Brie told Entertainment Weekly . ""The audition process has not changed that much.""  Brie revealed that years ago, in an audition for the HBO series Entourage , the casting panel asked her to take her top off. She said, ""Early in my career, I auditioned for three lines on an episode of Entourage that I had to go on in a bikini! Or like shorts and the tiniest shorts. And they were like, 'OK, can you take your top off now?'""  Jennifer Euston, the casting director for GLOW , later took to Twitter to share her disdain for the experience Brie had. She tweeted, ""...makes me sick there are producers who abuse their power & if there was a Casting Director present, they did nothing? Inexcusable.""  HBO hasn't yet commented on Brie's claims, though her story isn't hard to believe, considering the hordes of naked women who appeared on the show over the years in roles that were hardly complex or, frankly, realistic.  Betty Gilpin, Brie's GLOW costar, also recounted an audition before a room full of men in which she was asked to take down her hair. ""That’s gross,"" Euston commented in response, according to EW .  Brie also pointed out that not only do actresses regularly face sexism on the job, but they are often left to compete with one another for reductive, uninteresting roles. ""I've gone through auditions for Marvel movies and auditioned a million times for roles with three lines and you are begging for them,"" she said. ""And I’d be glad to get them! It’s brutal, it just is.""  Girl power prevails, though; GLOW hits Netflix on June 23.  Update: Amid the outrage over her comments about her audition for Entourage, Brie herself chimed in on Twitter to clarify that she wasn't asked to appear completely topless—instead, she was asked to remove her shirt, under which she was wearing a bikini top. She tweeted, ""Re:Entourage - CLARIFICATION - I had a bikini top on UNDER my top. They didn't ask me to get totally topless. Sorry to disappoint you! 😎""  It's an improvement, but not by much, if you ask us.  RELATED: Dave Franco and Alison Brie Are Officially a Married Couple"	0
Hawaii Five-O “was a really important part of my life for seven years, and I’m grateful to CBS and everyone involved with the show for giving me the opportunity,” Daniel Dae Kim said at TCA this morning during a Q&A for ABC’s new The Good Doctor, on which he is EP.  Kim had been asked – again – to discuss his decision to exit the CBS procedural, a topic that has been covered long and often since it happened.  “I’ve known [CBS Entertainment President] Kelly [Kahl] and [CBS SEVP Programming] Thom [Sherman] for a while…I know them, and like them, and am grateful to them for the words they said on their panel the other day.”  “That said, it’s possible to be grateful and respectful, and still maintain a steadfast sense of your self worth,” Kim said, pointedly.  Days earlier at TCA, Kahl and Sherman took multiple questions about the controversial exits of Hawaii Five-0‘s two Asian co-stars, Kim and Grace Park, who sought parity with the show’s leads, Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, and left after not getting equal pay.  “We never like to lose characters audiences love but that happens on long-running series,” Kahl had said that morning. “We made very lucrative offers to those actors,” he added, while declining to name the dollar amount or how it compared to the salaries of series stars O’Loughlin and Caan. Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.  Saying it was time to “close that chapter…and begin this chapter” of his life, Kim said this morning he “could not be more excited to be back on ABC,” where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. “This is the start of something new.”  And yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he’s not on the CBS series and is now “behind the scenes” on ABC’s doc drama.  “Good morning,” Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.  “I’m very proud to be part of this show,” said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.  “It started as a Korean show,” Kim said. “I loved the message of it,” noting also that the doctor drama is a “familiar genre to American audiences.” The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit.  Kim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.  “I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.  “At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’	0
Caitlyn Jenner has been spotted sporting hearing aids, sparking fears the transgender star may be heading toward another transition — deafness, but thankfully, the former Olympian has new girlfriend Sophia Hutchins as a shoulder to lean on.  Jenner, 68, was snapped wearing the devices during her recent beach holiday in Mexico with her 21-year-old new trans arm candy.  “Cait’s hearing has gotten worse over the years, and she can’t hear much without them,” a source told RadarOnline.com exclusively. “She’s tried covering them up with her hair, but the beach wind exposed them to the world!”  Sophia, a student at California’s Pepperdine University, credits the famous former athlete for inspiring her gender reassignment surgery.  PHOTOS: Caitlyn’s New Girlfriend Exposed: Jenner, 68, Dating Trans Model & College Student, 21!  What’s more, she’s been totally supportive as Caitlyn struggles with hearing issues.  “Sophia doesn’t judge Cait for wearing hearing aids. In fact, she said that she wanted to get a pair just like them when the time comes, which made Cait laugh,” dished the insider.  But Cait’s fading hearing is no joke to family insiders. “They’re worried that Cait’s happiness is clouding the bigger issue — she might be going deaf!” added the source.  As Radar exclusively reported, things between the two have been heating up for the past few months. Hutchins posted frequent pictures of Jenner’s dog and tell-tale shots about their relationship from the Sherwood Country Club, where her girlfriend was a member and an avid golfer.

Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  It wasn’t like Anthony Bourdain to skip a good meal.  When the star of “Parts Unknown” didn’t come down from his hotel room for a rustic French dinner Thursday night, it was the first sign something was very wrong.  “We thought it was strange,” waiter Maxime Voinson told the New York Times Saturday, recalling Bourdain’s no-show the night before his suicide.  “Mr. Ripert thought it was strange,” he added, referring to Eric Ripert, the renowned French chef who would find close friend Bourdain upstairs the next morning, hanged in his hotel bathroom.  Ripert, Bourdain and the crew of the CNN show had traveled early last week to the med­ieval village of Kayserberg in northeastern France to film an episode on Alsatian food.  They were staying at Le Chambard, a five-star hotel in a cozy, converted 18th-century mansion.  Pretty much every night, Bourdain and Ripert, the executive chef at Manhattan’s famed Le Bernadin, would dine together at the hotel’s quaint bistro, the Winstub, known for its foie gras and charcuterie.  “Mr. Bourdain knew the chef, Monsieur Nasti,” the waiter told the Times, referring to chef Oliver Nasti.  “He knew the kitchen,” the waiter recalled. “Maybe he went out and ate somewhere else, we said. But we didn’t think much of it.”  Bourdain and Ripert had also eaten breakfast together each morning, again at the Winstub’s big, distressed-wood tables.  “Fresh bread, Viennese pastries, kouglof, panacota verrines, dried fruits,” the hotel lists as breakfast offerings. “Dried fruits, cold cuts, local cheese, fruit salad, butter, honey and a jar of Christine Ferber jam.”  But again, on Friday morning, Bourdain didn’t join him at the table.  “His friend was waiting at breakfast,” the waiter told the Times.  “And waiting and waiting.”  Also waiting, just down the road, was Bourdain’s camera crew.  Master butcher Christine Speisser told People magazine Saturday that the crew had set up to film at an outdoor market in nearby Strasbourg.  Speisser was to show Bourdain around the market, starting at 10 a.m.  “For me, it was something exceptional,” she told People.  “It was an honor to receive chef Bourdain.  “People knew he was coming to the market, and everything was in place, ready to film,” she said.  ‘He is the last person in the world I’d imagine to do something like that.’  But back at the hotel, Bourdain wasn’t picking up his cellphone. It was 9:30 a.m.  Ripert got up from his table at the Winstub, where he had been set to choose from among the breads, pastries and local cheeses with his good friend.  French authorities say a receptionist ­unlocked Bourdain’s hotel room door.  Inside, the 61-year-old TV host had used the belt of his hotel bathrobe to hang himself in his bathroom.  Ripert found him “unresponsive,” CNN reported.  There were no other signs of violence to Bourdain’s body, local prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny said Saturday.  “There is no element that makes us suspect that someone came into the room at any moment,” the prosecutor added.  De Rocquigny also noted that the suicide appeared to have been an “impulsive act.”  Blood was drawn from the body, and results of screenings for drugs or other toxins will follow in coming days.  “This is solely to give the family more information about the motivations and the cause of death,” de Rocquigny said of the screenings.  “We have no indication that he was consuming alcohol the days before his death or changed his behavior.”  “A visionary,” Nasti, the Chambard chef, would say Saturday of his lost guest and friend, offering his condolences to Bourdain’s family “and all those around the world who he caused to dream.”  Over at the outdoor market, Speisser continued to wait.  Then a production assistant rushed to the scene, announcing, “There’s a big problem.”  “It was like they were all struck by lightning,” Speisser told People magazine Saturday.  “They all just sat on the ground.”  An hour would pass.  “They didn’t say what was happening. They probably didn’t know everything,” Speisser’s friend Christelle Schenck, who had been there to help with the filming, told People.  Finally, “apparently, they need to cancel, we were told,” Schenck said.  “They said we’ll call you back.”  The crew packed up and left the market.  Reached by The Post on Saturday, Bourdain’s mother, Gladys, 83, a longtime Times editor, could barely speak.  “It’s really too difficult,” she said.  “He was an incredible guy. I really can’t talk about him … He was brilliant and sharp and funny,” she said.  “He is the last person in the world I’d imagine to do something like that.”  Still, by many accounts, including Ripert’s, Bourdain had not been himself.  There was exhaustion — and darkness.  see also Friends and colleagues remember Anthony Bourdain Hundreds paid tribute after the passing of legendary celebrity chef...  Gladys Bourdain recalled Ripert telling her that “Tony had been in a dark mood these past couple of days,” Ripert told Bourdain’s mother Friday, according to the Times.  Anthony Bourdain had reportedly kept a brutal work schedule filming “Parts Unknown” in the months before his death and was “absolutely exhausted,” a source told People.  “​His travel schedule was grueling, and he often seemed quite beat-up from it, as anyone would be,” said the source, described by the magazine as having worked closely with Bourdain in the past year.  “He’d put everything into the shoots and then go back to his room to ­isolate.”  Tributes to Bourdain continued to pour in from around the world Saturday.  He had been a devoted student of jiujitsu. Champion Lucas ­Lepri, who trained Bourdain at his home in the Hamptons, recalled how his student surprised him one day with a home-cooked meal inspired by Lepri’s native Brazil.  “I was really moved because he cooked me a feijoada, which is a very special dish from Brazil, made with black beans and pork,” Lepri recalled.  “You have to be really devoted to cook a good feijoada, because you need to simmer the beans all day.  “Tony’s feijoada was incredible. He knew everything about Brazil and Brazilian food, and had traveled all over the country. He told me that the greatest Brazilian chefs came from Minas Gerais, my home state. He really moved me. I’ll never forget him.”  Jason Merder, Bourdain’s road manager from 2009 to 2013, remembered it wasn’t all fine dining with the celebrity chef.  “One of the funniest things was Tony’s craving for Popeye’s chicken,” he recalled.  “Every time we flew through Atlanta and had an hour between flights, I would get a look from him. And I was like, ‘All right, man, we’re going to Popeye’s.’  “It happened every single day, and it didn’t matter what time of day it was.”  Marilyn Hagerty was an octogenarian columnist for the Grand Forks Herald when her 2012 rave review for a new Olive Garden in her small South Dakota town went viral.  As trolls pounced, it was Bourdain who “came to my rescue,” she recalled.  He flew her to New York City, where they had coffee.  “He said he came to realize that what I do is a reflection of how people eat,” she said.  And he surprised her, too.  “I found him to be not a wild, reckless character of a person, as I had expected,” Hagerty told Time magazine. “He was nothing but kind and a gentleman.”  Related Video 1:38 How Anthony Bourdain’s daughter and ex are grieving  Additional reporting by Georgett Roberts, Kirsten ­Fleming, Lauren Steussy, Dana Schuster and wire services	0

"Katharine McPhee is sharing details about how her proposal from David Foster went down!  Shortly after news broke of their engagement on Tuesday, the 34-year-old actress took to Instagram to recall her exciting day.  According to a screenshot she posted of a text message conversation with Just Jared founder Jared Eng, Foster asked McPhee for her hand in marriage while the two were at the top of a mountain in Anacapri, Italy.  ""Totally dark, only stars,"" she said, jokingly adding that he ""thankfully"" didn't push her off the cliff. ""He said it was one or the other. And in the end he spared me.""  While McPhee has yet to publicly share a photo of the engagement ring the 68-year-old musician proposed to her with, Eng (who has seemingly seen a sneak peek of it) described it as ""beautiful"" and ""classic.""  ❤️💍😬 cc: @jaredeng A post shared by Katharine McPhee (@katharinemcphee) on Jul 3, 2018 at 10:37am PDT  She also seemingly addressed the news on Twitter, sharing a gif of Ariana Grande (who recently got engaged to Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson) accompanied with a ring emoji.  A rep for Foster confirmed to ET earlier Tuesday that he proposed to McPhee while the two were vacationing in Europe. The two were first linked together last May, and by December of 2017, they couldn't seem to keep their hands off each other during a PDA-packed trip to Paris, France.

How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don’t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?	1
"Katy Perry, Alyssa Milano, Sarah Hyland and Rob Delaney attacked the bill, designed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for its approach to pre-existing conditions and funding for Planned Parenthood.  Shortly after the House of Representatives voted on a health care bill designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, numerous Hollywood stars took to Twitter to condemn those politicians who supported the bill.  The Republican-backed measure won by a narrow 217-213 vote, with Democrats singing ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"" as the bill passed the legislative chamber, suggesting that the GOP's support for the bill would cost them in the 2018 midterm election.  ""I feel so confident,"" said President Trump during a live address after the passing of the bill. ""This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it.""  The bill, which now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate, will keep children on family policies until age 26 but will cut the Medicaid program for low-income people and end tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act on the health industry and those who earn high-paying salaries.  The bill will also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year and allows states to get waivers to free insurers from coverage requirements, which could cause them to charge people with pre-existing illnesses higher rates than they charge healthy customers.  In a viral video, Jimmy Kimmel expressed his views on equal healthcare for those with pre-existing conditions such as his newborn son. ""If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it should not matter how much money you make,"" he said while tearing up during his monologue on his show Monday night.  The hashtag #IAmAPreexistingCondition became a trending topic quickly after the bill was passed. America Ferrera, Sarah Hyland, Mark Ruffalo and George Takei took to Twitter to express their views.

"Leah Remini (Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)  About 2.1 million people tuned in Tuesday night to the premiere of A&E’s “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,” Remini’s eight-episode docuseries that promises a deep dive into “shocking stories of abuse, heartbreak and harassment” within the Church of Scientology. Network executives say it’s the channel’s most-watched premiere in two years.  A solid number for the show isn’t surprising — Scientology is one of those topics that’s irresistible, mostly because of the secretive nature of the famously controversial church. Remini, known for the hit sitcom “King of Queens,” was a devout Scientologist for 35 years before she left the church in 2013. She has been an outspoken critic ever since, although it is extremely rare for anyone to criticize Scientology after they leave. Here’s her history of calling out the church:  [How Leah Remini is trying to expose Scientology secrets in her new docuseries]  (For the record, the church has called Remini an “obnoxious, spiteful ex-Scientologist” and claims the actress is bitter that she was expelled for unethical conduct; it also disputes many statements made in the A&E show. Church officials say that Remini is trying to “distort the truth” about Scientology and that she’s “doing [the show] for the money and now tries to pretend otherwise.”)  Leah Remini, the actress best known for hit CBS sitcom ""King of Queens,"" produced a documentary series about the Church of Scientology. (A&E)  July 2013: Page Six confirms that Remini, who rose to very high levels in the organization once she became a star and donated millions, has left Scientology. A Remini “source” says the actress was “put through interrogations and blacklisted within the church” when she started to question leader David Miscavige, particularly the whereabouts of his wife, Shelly, who reportedly hasn’t been seen in public since 2007.  Remini said she also disagreed with the church’s policies that restrict members from talking to relatives who criticize the church, a practice known as “disconnecting.” “She is stepping back from a regime she thinks is corrupt. She thinks no religion should tear apart a family or abuse someone under the umbrella of ‘religion,’ ” the source says.  Later that month, Remini echoes this sentiment to People magazine. “I believe that people should be able to question things. I believe that people should value family, and value friendships, and hold those things sacrosanct,” she says. “That for me, that’s what I’m about. It wouldn’t matter what it was, simply because no one is going to tell me how I need to think, no one is going to tell me who I can, and cannot, talk to.”  August 2013: Remini files a missing-person report for Shelly Miscavige, which the Los Angeles Police Department calls “unfounded.” The church says it’s “ill-advised, ludicrous self-promotion” on Remini’s part.  September 2013: Remini joins the cast of “Dancing With the Stars,” where she lands in fifth place. During one episode, she tells her partner, Tony Dovolani, that she hoped the show would help her move on. “The church is looking for me to fail so they can say to their parishioners, ‘You see what happens when you leave the church?’ They’re waiting for me to fail,” Remini says.  February 2014: Remini tells Buzzfeed that she quit Scientology because her young daughter was getting closer to the age of getting “acclimated” in it and would have to sit for audits, where members divulge personal information. Plus, Remini thought Scientology was taking over her life. “I was spending most of my time at the Church,” she says. “So, I was saying ‘family first,’ but I wasn’t showing that. I didn’t like the message that sent my daughter.” (Scientology officials call Remini’s statements “absurd, insulting and motivated entirely by a desire to grab attention.”)  Scientology's famous members and secretive beliefs endlessly intrigue popular culture. Here's a look at some of television's best commentary on the religion. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)  March 2015: Alex Gibney’s “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief” documentary airs on HBO, featuring multiple ex-members telling horror stories about their time in the organization. Remini tweets her praise: “Thank you to the brave who did something about it. And to those who didn’t have a voice, you do now.”  May 2015: Remini sits for an interview with Oprah Winfrey in “Oprah: Where Are They Now?” and talks about how painful it was to leave friends behind in the church. “I’m learning there’s a new world out here and there shouldn’t be any kind of judgment toward somebody who has a belief system that is not yours,” she says.  July 2015: The second and final season of her TLC reality show, “Leah Remini: It’s All Relative,” premieres, and Remini talks more about how she left to protect her daughter.  October 2015: Remini writes a book, “Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology,” and promotes it with an in-depth interview on “20/20,” reiterating her previous claims and saying she didn’t want want to be “disconnected” from her daughter.  November 2015: Remini’s book is released, and she spills lots of dirt, including tales of Scientology superstar Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’s wedding weekend, which is where her relationship with the church started to go downhill after Remini was accused of behaving badly. The church’s response? Remini is “pathetically exploiting her former religion, her former friends and other celebrities for money and attention to appear relevant again.”  December 2015: According to her show on A&E, Remini starts to get lots of requests for help from people who still have family members in the church. She captures one story on video of a family torn apart by Scientology, and decides to develop a show.  November 2016: “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath” premieres on A&E, chronicling Remini’s past and the stories of former members, who allege physical and sexual abuse. (Scientology officials say all of them are lying.)  “I want to give a voice to these stories,” Remini says in the show, “enough that people will be incensed by it to put some pressure on this organization to stop abusing people.”  Read more:  How Scientology controls John Travolta and Tom Cruise, according to ‘Going Clear’  Leah Remini talks about why she left Scientology  Katie Holmes says so much about Scientology without saying anything at all in ‘The Giver’"	0
"CLOSE Jay-Z's new album ‘4:44’ is basically his reaction to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""  ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.""  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup ""the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart,"" and denied the rumors ""that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.  For Jay fans hoping to see 4:44 live, the rapper announced a 31-city tour on Monday, which kicks off in October.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uMsLVv"	0

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is debuting some of her closing arguments in her campaign ads, including a spot that is narrated by Morgan Freeman.  Titled “Example,” the spot contrasts Clinton’s career with that of Donald Trump, positioning it as a choice of “who will we entrust our country and their future to.” For example, the ad presents Clinton as knowledgable and steady, and Trump as unprepared and reckless.  The one-minute ad, below, will air as part of an existing ad buy in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as on with national cable.  Clinton’s campaign has also featured ads from the Shonda Rhimes produced shows “Scandal,” “How to Get Away With Murder” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” as well as one featuring the cast of “Empire.”  Freeman narrated an ad for Clinton that aired before the South Carolina primary, and also was the voice heard on a biographical video shown at the Democratic National Convention. He also narrated an ad for President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012.	1
"Selena Gomez made her first public appearance since the Met Gala yesterday, appearing at Puma's Defy City Los Angeles event in the Paramount Studios lot to celebrate the brand's new Defy shoe. Gomez met a ton of fans and managed to make another good joke at her Met Gala spray tan that drew a lot of critical tweets because it didn't photograph well on the red carpet. ""I fixed it from Met Gala,"" she quipped of her bronze glow to fans complimenting her appearance.  Gomez's first joke about the tan was posted three days after the Met Gala. ""Me when I saw my pictures from MET,"" she wrote with a shrug emoji and footage of her running away.  Selena Gomez at the Met Gala. Getty Images  A source made it clear to People then that Gomez was joking only about the tan and hair, not her dress. “In person, she honestly felt great but not everything looks the same as it does in person,” the source explained. “She was just clapping back at people who were commenting on her tan and hair and wanted to make a joke about it.”    Gomez herself shared several videos of herself meeting fans yesterday on her Instagram story. She changed her hair again for the event, making it long with extensions. She appears to still be wearing her cross necklace from the Met Gala, too.  Getty Images  Getty Images  Getty Images"	0
"ABC's popular Once Upon a Time is coming back – but not as you know it.  The fantastical fairy tale series is hitting the reset button for season seven, resulting in a significantly different cast, among other things. Here is everything you need to know about the impending reboot.  Once Upon a Time season 7 release date: When is it on?  Once Upon a Time was renewed for a seventh season on May 11, 2017, with ABC ordering 22 episodes.  At Comic-Con 2017, ABC confirmed that the show will return on Friday, October 6 as part of the network's 2017-18 autumn schedule – yes, Friday nights as opposed to Sunday nights in previous seasons.  ABC  Friday is traditionally a tough night for TV ratings, but ABC is confident the show can perform.  ""We've turned Friday into more of a destination for our fantasy and science fiction fans,"" ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey explained.  On June 20, co-creator, showrunner, and writer Adam Horowitz posted a snap of the writers' room whiteboard on Instagram – indicating that work on the seventh season had begun:  And on July 6, Horowitz confirmed the start of filming:  However, could it be the final ever season? Jamie Chung (who plays recurring character Mulan) claimed that she heard one of the show bosses talking about season seven as if it's the last.  But she did add that the drama is probably ""just going to keep on going"". So don't worry just yet.  Once Upon a Time season 7 cast: Who will be back?  Season six had nine series regulars, but only three will be back in a regular capacity in the new season. They are:  • Lana Parrilla (The Evil Queen / Regina Mills)  • Robert Carlyle (Rumplestiltskin / Mr Gold)  • Colin O'Donoghue (Captain Hook / Killian Jones)  ABC  That means the following actors are no longer series regulars :  • Jennifer Morrison (Emma Swan)  • Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard)  • Josh Dallas (Prince Charming / David Nolan)  • Emilie de Ravin (Belle / Belle Gold)  • Jared S Gilmore (Henry Mills)  • Rebecca Mader (Wicked Witch of the West / Zelena)  That's right: Hook but no Emma Swan for season seven. Jennifer Morrison, who plays Emma, was offered an extension to her contract as well, but she turned it down citing personal reasons.  ""As much as I love the show, I ultimately had to do what was right for me, and I need to be home,"" she said. ""I need to be in New York, in LA [the show is filmed in Vancouver], I need to be around my family and friends and have a chance at a personal life, and to have opportunities to do new things creatively.""  Fans will definitely see Emma at least one more time, though. She has agreed to appear in one episode early this new season (7.02, to be precise), and filmed her scenes in mid-July.  Rebecca Mader (Zelena) was the second star to confirm her exit, explaining that she was dropped for creative reasons as part of the reboot.  Then, showrunners Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz confirmed that Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Emilie de Ravin and Jared S Gilmore will all also not be back as regulars – announcing this just two days before the season six finale aired.  De Ravin responded to the announcement on social media, saying that she ""would have loved to continue exploring Belle's journey"" but that it has also ""been an honour and privilege to bring Belle to life"".  ABC  After the finale aired, Goodwin described Snow and Charming's happy ending as a ""bittersweet decision"" and said that she would be keen to return as Snow in the future.  The showrunners have said that the departures of these beloved characters will be referenced in the new season.  They later confirmed that Gilmore will make an appearance in the season seven premiere to bridge the time gap between the season six finale and the events of season seven.  De Ravin will feature in episode four, to provide an ""update"" on her character Belle, while Mader too will pop up in ""multiple"" episodes. Wicked always wins...  ABC  Of course, in light of the mass departure, there will be some brand new additions people can look forward to seeing, as the show relocates from Storybrooke to Hyperion Heights.  Here are the stars joining the show for season seven as new series regulars:  • Andrew J West (Adult Henry Mills)  • Alison Fernandez (Lucy)  • Gabrielle Anwar (Lady Tremaine / Victoria Belfrey)  • Dania Ramirez (Cinderella / Jacinda)  • Mekia Cox (Tiana / Sabine)  And notable recurring characters include:  • Adelaide Kane (Drizella / Ivy)  • Rose Reynolds (Alice / Tilly)  Jared S Gilmore may be young Henry, but scenes in the season six finale revealed a time jump as an adult Henry was seen living in a Seattle apartment – numbered 815, obviously. Adult Henry is portrayed by Andrew J West, who fans of The Walking Dead may remember as cannibal Gareth.  The scenes also introduced adult Henry's daughter Lucy, played by Alison Fernandez (Jane the Virgin, Orange Is the New Black).  ABC  Gabrielle Anwar (Burn Notice) and Dania Ramirez (Heroes, Devious Maids) were announced to be joining the cast in early July. Ramirez will be playing Cinderella – a role previously inhabited by Jessy Schram – who is also Lucy's mother, while Anwar has been cast as Lady Tremaine, Cinderella's wicked stepmother.  Lady Tremaine (aka Victoria Belfrey in Hyperion Heights) has been described as being even more ruthless than the Evil Queen, and is the one who is behind the new curse.  ""Why it's important for her to be royal, why it's important for her to crush everyone else, is the story of the year. In true Once Upon a Time fashion, evil isn't born – it's made, and we'll see that with her as well,"" explained showrunner Edward Kitsis.  ABC/Eike Schroter  Related: Here's how Once Upon a Time season 7 might introduce new versions of classic characters  It's unclear how the different Cinderellas will play out exactly, but showrunner Edward Kitsis teased: ""New books could have different versions of some stories and ways of looking at them that maybe we've seen before, maybe some new characters as well.""  Also in July, Rose Reynolds (Poldark), Adelaide Kane (Reign), and Mekia Cox (Chicago Med) boarded as recurring characters. In August, Cox was upped to series regular.  Reynolds will be picking up the role of Alice from Alice in Wonderland, while Kane and Cox have been confirmed to be playing Drizella (one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters) and Tiana (from The Princess and the Frog) respectively.  ABC  The cursed counterpart of Ramirez's Cinderella is called Jacinda, while Tiana goes by Sabine. Drizella and Alice go by the names Ivy and Tilly in Hyperion Heights.  Kane gave a little tease about Drizella / Ivy, describing her character as ""buttoned-up and bitchy"".  ""She seems like a very high-strung, slightly ditzy young woman, and she's just very petty and she's like that awful bully in high school, except that she doesn't know how to win people to her side,"" she shared. ""So she's just alone, snappy, snarky, sarcastic, and miserable all the time.""  On the other hand, Alice is somebody who appears to be working for Rumplestiltskin / Weaver – both in the Enchanted Forest and in Hyperion Heights.  ABC  Elsewhere, Once Upon a Time is bringing back Giles Matthey as Gideon for one episode, Robin Givens has been cast as Tiana's mother Eudora, described as a ""benevolent noblewoman"", and Meegan Warner will play a new and different version of Rapunzel.  One character who is not expected to be returning is Sean Maguire's Robin Hood.  ""Never say never, but not in the immediate run of episodes,"" said showrunner Adam Horowitz.  Once Upon a Time season 7 trailer: 'A New Curse Awakens'  The Once Upon a Time panel at Comic-Con 2017 dropped a quick tease about what to expect from the rebooted series, premiering two scenes from the upcoming season as well as a new trailer.  The trailer quickly recapped the series so far before replaying the end of season six, which saw the adult Henry visited by his daughter as Henry visited Emma Swan in the pilot.  Additionally, the two scenes that aired at the panel featured Jared S Gilmore's young version of Henry as he goes to explore new fairy tales, while a second showed adult Henry is crashing into Cinderella's horse-drawn carriage.  Teasing what's next for the show, showrunner Edward Kitsis said: ""What we're going to do now is go on a new adventure.""  Once Upon a Time season 7 spoilers: Plot details revealed  The sixth season finale offered a tease as to what to expect for season seven, as it appears that adult Henry has lost his belief in fairy tales – a clear (and intentional) parallel to the start of Emma's journey in the pilot episode all those years ago.  ""Come on. Your family needs you,"" Lucy tells a very puzzled and sceptical Henry.  ABC/Jack Rowand  Previous fan theories speculated that Lucy's mother could be Disney's Moana or Narnia's Lucy Pevensie, but she is actually none other than Cinderella (Dania Ramirez). Co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz have promised that it will be a proper love story and plays a huge part in the story for season seven.  ""Henry has left home and he wants to go and see other Storybrookes with different stories and different characters, and he obviously falls in love with Cinderella,"" showrunner Edward Kitsis shared.  ""Much like the romance his grandparents [Snow and Charming] had, what happens is what always happens, is he gets into trouble. And he calls up help from his family [Evil Queen, Hook, Rumplestiltskin].""  ABC  Despite Henry having aged several years, Kitsis and Horowitz all but confirmed that returning characters Regina, Mr Gold, and Hook will remain the same age as before.  ""The age and how Henry is as old as he is without everyone else is dealt with right away as we set up the new paradigm,"" they said. ""I think it was purposefully oblique [in the season six finale] but we have a plan in place and we're also allowing Rumple, Hook and the Evil Queen to be in it.""  Regina, Mr Gold and Hook have had their happy endings, but what drags them back into the action? ABC released a statement as to what season seven will look like, promising that they will ""join forces"" with Henry and Lucy on another ""epic quest"".  ABC Getty Images/Digitalspy.com  ""Fairy tale characters new and old search for true love, find adventure, and once again take sides in the struggle of good against evil, as classic tales are once more twisted and reimagined,"" the description added.  And ABC exec Channing Dungey teased that Regina, Mr Gold and Hook will ""return but with new identities in a new city, facing a new curse"".  Indeed. That new city is Seattle, and we know bits and pieces about the trio's new personas.  The cursed Regina is called Roni in Seattle, and she runs a bar.  ABC  ""I'm in denim and rock T-shirts,"" Parrilla said in an interview. ""When we meet her, this other version of Regina, she's working in a bar. She's a bar owner. She's a little rough around the edges… This version feels really different. She's no longer in charge.  ""I'm having a blast playing her. We're all still discovering who she is. It's refreshing, it's different.""  Roni will be getting a love interest, but it won't be the most integral part of her arc this year.  We know much less about who Rumplestiltskin is, but Horowitz had this to say: ""He's involved in many of the goings on in this neighbourhood in Seattle. We don't want to say too much of the specifics of it, but it's a lot of fun, and it's another layer and colour for [Carlyle] to play.""  ABC  As for Hook, he's a cop named Rogers.  O'Donoghue said: ""I describe that there's a sense of loss there in the guy and he just doesn't know what it is that's missing. He's striving in some way to find who he is still, yet the Hook that we meet is trying to be the best uniform cop that he can be and do the right thing.""  But wait, how are the writers going to explain why Emma is not alongside Hook? Some fans are fearing that Emma will be killed off (especially since Jennifer Morrison will be back for one episode – the second episode). Is there any truth to that? Kitsis and Horowitz are remaining coy.  ""There's nothing to say,"" Kitsis said. ""That is correct, she is coming back for an episode. Their happiness is real, and people should enjoy that.""  ABC  Whatever happens, Hook will not be having a new love interest anytime soon.  ""I think that Emma is absolutely Hook's soulmate that we saw – so the Hook we all know and love, how could he look elsewhere?"" Kitsis added at Disney's D23 expo in July, while Horowitz interestingly teased: ""We can't say whether or not they have a child, but we can tell you we answer that question in the beginning of the season.""  But the showrunners have assured fans that the show will have a very familiar feel to it, even with the cast shake-up and a move away from Storybrooke.  ABC/Jack Rowand  ""We're trying to tell the same kind of stories and honor the DNA of what Once Upon a Time was from the very start,"" Horowitz explained. ""While there are some characters returning and some not returning, it's still the same universe, and it's still the same kind of storytelling.  ""It's just that we're going to be coming at it from a little bit of a different angle. It's not going to be necessarily Storybrooke-based.""  Horowitz later said that flashbacks will remain a significant part of the show. ""That's one of the great advantages of having characters who can be hundreds of years old, we can span different eras and do many different things,"" he said.  ABC  Meanwhile, there will be a ""prominent"" LGBTQ storyline this season, which sounds awesome.  ""It's going to look like any other relationship we've had on the show,"" Horowitz told BuzzFeed. ""It's not going to be any different other than the fact that it's LGBT. It's important to us that it [Hyperion Heights] does reflect the world that exists. It feels normal.""  Lana Parrilla has said that she'd be interested in seeing Star Wars invade the Once universe, adding that she would love to face off against Darth Vader, one of cinema's most iconic villains.  ""It would just be fun, I think, to just battle him,"" she said. ""I've seen crazy fan art with the Evil Queen versus Darth Vader and they're both holding lightsabers. I would just love that.""  But don't expect the Evil Queen's infertility to be revisited. Parrilla shut down that fan theory at Comic-Con.  Disney ABC/DigitalSpy  Lastly, there's a fan campaign – retweeted by de Ravin – to dedicate the season seven premiere to Georgina Callander, one of the victims in the devastating Manchester Arena terror attack on May 22, 2017.  Georgina, 18, was a Once Upon a Time superfan and met stars including Parrilla, de Ravin, and Mader one month before she tragically lost her life.  Once Upon a Time season 7 episodes  Season 7 episode 1: What happened in 'Hyperion Heights'?  Jared S Gilmore briefly reprises his role as young Henry – hopping on August's motorcycle and insisting to Regina that he will be fine, as he sets off to explore new realms.  A few years pass, with Andrew J West playing the adult version of Henry. In the Magical Forest, a near-collision on the road causes Henry and a previously-unseen version of Cinderella (Dania Ramirez) to meet.  Cinderella takes Henry's bike and dagger in a quest to kill the prince for revenge. Henry tries to convince her to come with him to his realm. Cinderella backs out of killing the prince, but her evil stepmother Lady Tremaine does it anyway and frames Cinderella for the crime.  Henry decides to stay in the Magical Forest realm after finding one of Cinderella's glass slippers just before he is set to leave.  ABC  In the present day, Henry lives in a Seattle neighbourhood named 'Hyperion Heights' while affected by a new curse.  Regina (Roni), Hook (Rogers), and Rumplestiltskin (Weaver) are all victims of the curse as well, having had their memories wiped, as Henry's daughter Lucy (and also the daughter of Jacinda – Cinderella's alter ego in Hyperion Heights) pays a visit in an attempt to break the spell.  Meanwhile, Victoria Belfrey (aka Cinderella's wicked stepmother Lady Tremaine) is looking to gentrify the neighbourhood and attempts to pressure Roni into selling her bar. Roni resists.  Season 7 episode 2: What happened in 'A Pirate's Life'?  Flashbacks see Jennifer Morrison reprise her role as Emma Swan, and the episode reveals why Hook is in Hyperion Heights but not Emma. It turns out that the Hook in Hyperion Heights is actually the Hook from the Wish Realm.  When Henry uses a magic bottle to ask Emma, Hook, and Regina for help, Wish Hook also answers Henry's call and initially takes original Hook's place.  But after Emma arrives and reveals that she is pregnant, Wish Hook comes clean and reveals the truth about his daughter: she has been trapped in a tower by a witch.  Henry decides to continue on his journey – accompanied by Wish Hook and Regina – while Emma and original Hook return to Storybrooke.  ABC  In Hyperion Heights, Victoria hires Rogers and Weaver to force Henry out of Hyperion Heights – but Rogers helps Henry instead. Rogers, Henry, and Roni agree to form an alliance to put an end to Victoria's scheming.  Season 7 episode 3: What happened in 'The Garden of Forking Paths'?  In flashbacks, Cinderella, Henry, Regina, and Hook team up with Princess Tiana (the leader of a resistance group) in the fight against Lady Tremaine.  Cinderella secretly confronts Lady Tremaine. Tremaine reveals that she has preserved the body ofher own daughter Anastasia, and that she hopes to revive Anastasia with the heart of the truest believer. That heart is, of course, Henry's. Tremaine says that she will spare Cinderella (and the resistance) if Cinderella deliver's Henry's heart.  Regina stops Cinderella from acting on this before it's too late.  In Hyperion Heights, Victoria has plans to replace the community garden with a new building, and Jacinda attempts to stop this by getting people to sign a petition.  Lucy believes Victoria is looking for something at the garden, and her suspicions seem to be well-founded when she finds a piece of Cinderella's glass slipper in the tunnels, which she gives to Henry as proof that Jacinda is Cinderella.  Victoria/Tremaine – who it turns out isn't cursed – eventually finds Anastasia's preserved body. It is also revealed that she is holding a witch captive and demands her to use a spell to take Lucy's belief away in order to resurrect Anastasia. The witch says no, saying there would be consequences.  Season 7 episode 4: What happened in 'Beauty'?  In flashbacks, Rumplestiltskin and Belle spend a number of years looking for a way to lift the Dark One curse from Rumplestiltskin, so he can become mortal and they can live the rest of their lives together.  Belle finds a prophecy, leading them to build a home at a place called the Edge of Realms. Rumplestiltskin and Belle live together here, but Belle – ageing and dying – reveals that she figured out a while ago that the prophecy actually means that her death will lead Rumplestiltskin to begin his journey to rid himself of the Darkness.  ABC  After Belle's death, Rumplestiltskin sets off to find the person who he can pass the Darkness onto – a mysterious Guardian.  In Hyperion Heights, Tilly (Alice in Wonderland) briefly wakes up from the curse and tries to convince Weaver that he is Rumplestiltskin, even shooting him to prove that he is immortal. Weaver remembers, and believe that Tilly will play an important part in reuniting him with Belle.  Season 7 episode 5: What happened in 'Greenbacks'?  In the past, Tiana helps a man named Robert to reunite with his lover: a frog. The true love's curse is broken as Robert kisses the frog. In a slight twist, Robert is actually a frog, and transforms back into one to be with his true love.  In Hyperion Heights, Rogers gets a lead on his missing daughter, whose name is Eloise Gardener. He interrogates a man with a tattoo that is linked to Eloise, but is forced to release him. This man is later on the phone, informing a mystery person that somebody is looking for the girl.  Also, Ivy turns out not to be cursed. She is plotting with the witch in the tower against her mother Victoria.  Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

When Ada Vox sang “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” she meant it. Audiences did not vote through the American Idol contestant, but judge Katy Perry made an executive decision and sent the singer immediately into the Top 10.  https://www.eonline.com/news/929545/katy-perry-on-saving-american-idol-s-ada-vox-we-still-have-a-lot-to-learn-but-we-know-talent-when-we-see-it	0
Swedish four-piece take to Instagram to announce two releases that will form part of an ‘avatar tour project’  Abba have announced that they have written and recorded their first new songs since they split in 1983.  The Swedish four-piece, who had nine No 1 hits in the UK between 1974 and 1980, and who have sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide, announced on Instagram that they had recorded two new songs for a project in which avatars of the band will perform.  Abba's return will be either genius or disaster – but nothing in between | Alexis Petridis Read more  The band said in a statement: “The decision to go ahead with the exciting Abba avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!”  One of the two new songs that resulted, called I Still Have Faith in You, will feature in a TV special to air in December.  The statement concluded: “We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.”  Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus revealed details of the band’s forthcoming project in Brussels earlier this week. The centrepiece is the two-hour TV show co-produced by NBC and the BBC, which will see the band perform as computer-generated avatars. Ulvaeus said the band had been digitally scanned and “de-aged” to look like they did in 1979, when they performed their third and final tour.  The avatars are then set to tour the world from next year.  Abba formed in Stockholm in 1972. They comprised two couples: Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog; and Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, all of whom had enjoyed musical careers in Sweden. The group burst on to the international stage after winning the Eurovision song contest in Brighton in 1974 with their song Waterloo.  From the mid-70s until they split, Abba built up a formidable arsenal of global hits including Knowing Me, Knowing You, Take a Chance on Me, Dancing Queen and The Name of the Game – all of which reached No 1 in the UK.  Fältskog and Lyngstad were the lead singers; Andersson and Ulvaeus composed the songs. Never less than impeccably produced and performed, Abba’s records were critically disdained at the time, but their popularity has endured. Their 1992 compilation Abba Gold has sold 30m copies – more than 5m of those in the Britain – and spent 833 weeks in the UK album charts.  Their jukebox musical Mamma Mia! debuted in the West End in 1999 and is still running both in London and worldwide; its website claims that it has been seen by 60 million people in 440 cities.  The stage show was adapted into a film in 2008, which grossed $615m (£447m) worldwide. A sequel, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, will be released in June. The actor Lily James – who is set to appear alongside the cast of the first film including Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth – told the BBC last week: “There’s lot of songs in there, lots of new ones. Lots of ones, actually, that weren’t in my repertoire of Abba and I think they’re going to be huge hits again, and reawaken the love of Abba.”  Abba’s split in 1983 followed the divorces of both couples. Ulvaeus and Andersson went on to write two musicals, including Chess – a revival by the English National Opera opens on Friday in London – before largely devoting themselves to Abba’s legacy. Fältskog and Lyngstad have kept much lower profiles, though Fältskog – long claimed to be a recluse – returned to pop music with an album, A, which was released in 2013.  The group have long held out against lucrative offers to reform – they were reported to have been offered $1bn to play a concert in 2000. In 2014, Ulvaeus told Billboard: “you will never see us on stage again … we don’t need the money, for one thing.”  Peter Robinson, editor of Popjustice, described the announcement as “the biggest pop news of the 21st century. Most fans grudgingly admired Abba’s refusal to record new music, but I think we all sometimes daydreamed about the band possibly, maybe, one day having a rethink at the right time, on the right terms and for the right reasons, which seems to be what’s happened here.” He added: “It’s a pop miracle.”	0

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Caitlyn Jenner has said time and time again that she's ""just friends"" with blonde bombshell Sophia Hutchins.  But now, it's being reported that they're getting married!  After their close friendship was described as a ""mother and daughter"" relationship, it's now said they've been dating in recent weeks.  And things are getting serious very quickly - despite their 47-year age gap.  If Caitlyn, 68, married 21-year-old transgender student Sophia, it would be her fourth marriage.  Before transitioning in 2015, she tied the knot three times as Bruce - to Chrystie Crownover in 1972, Linda Thompson in 1981, and to Kris Jenner in 1991.  (Image: ITV Picture Desk)  (Image: Getty Images North America)  Caitlyn has six biological children - two with each wife - and was step-father to Kris' kids, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian.  Now, a source close to the star has told Heat magazine: ""Cait really sees herself spending the rest of her life with Sophia.  ""She lost her support system when she fell out with her family and these days, it feels like Sophia's the only person she can count on.""  Earlier this year, it's said that Caitlyn turned to Sophia when her relationship with the Kardashians began to break down.

""She was really hoping to reconnect with the Kardashians, especially with Khloe and Kim having had babies, but sadly she hasn't met them, and she hasn't even got to spend much time with her new granddaughter Stormi [Kylie Jenner's baby].

However, a source close to Caitlyn told Mirror Online that while they could be dating, marriage isn't on the cards just yet.  Back in January, Caitlyn made a number of revelations during her tell-all interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories.  And she said at the time she was open to dating men and women.  She said: ""It could be either. I don't know. It is kind of fun so see the world from the girl's side. You know."""	1

(JTA) — Most artists would see playing one concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.  Before and after his landmark show last week at the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible — and likely all-time record-breaking — MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  “This past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,” he said.  Although Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.  On the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said “both sides” were to blame for the violence that occurred — and that were some “very fine people” among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.  “I had to do something that night,” Joel responded. “The president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, ‘There’s some good people on that side …’ No, Nazis aren’t good people.  “It really enraged me, actually,” he continued. “My old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. … My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.”  While many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.  But the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards — Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff’s girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a “mainstream thing again.”  RELATED:  Billy Joel wore a yellow Jewish star. Thanks, but the trend should stop there.	1
"Two former partners of Chip Gaines in the creation of the Magnolia Real Estate Company are suing the “Fixer Upper” star for fraud, claiming that Gaines bought them out without telling them that HGTV had decided to broadcast the show nationally “and that the show prominently featured the ‘Magnolia’ brand name.”  (Photo by Neal Klaeser)  In the 24-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court in Waco, Gaines’s two former partners, lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.  Gaines’ spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.""  Lewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.  The suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.  The suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the “Fixer Upper” program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.  Gaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.  ""With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that “Fixer Upper” was picked up by HGTV.""  The suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell “before they discovered the company’s value was radically enhanced by ‘Fixer Upper.’”  When Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark “to be careful.”  “I don’t come from the nerdy prep school he’s from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he’s not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I’m not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,” the text read, according to the suit.  Since the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs “over 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.”  In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis’ and Clark’s interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners"	0

In August 2016, Bieber threatened to leave Instagram after his rumored relationship with Sofia Richie was met with criticism from fans. “I’m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don’t stop the hate,” Bieber captioned a black-and-white photo with the model. “This is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn’t be so mean to people that I like.”  Gomez quickly weighed in with her own bit of advice. “If you can’t handle the hate, then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol – It should be special between you two only,” Gomez commented on his post. “Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you and supported you before any one ever did.” Bieber responded: “It’s funny to see people that used me for attention and still try to point the finger this way.” The back-and-forth didn’t last long, however. Gomez eventually took to her Snapchat to apologize for her initial comment.	0

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.Sec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security’s determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.Sec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant’s likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant’s ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.Sec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.(e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest — including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship — and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.(f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.(g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.Sec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.Sec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.Sec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.Sec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.Sec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.(b) The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.Sec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

"Stamos redirects here. For a surname, see Stamos (surname)  John Phillip Stamos ( STAY-mohss; born August 19, 1963)[1] is an American actor, producer, musician, and singer. He first gained recognition for his contract role as Blackie Parrish on the ABC television series General Hospital, for which he was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He is known for his work in television, especially in his starring role as Jesse Katsopolis on the ABC sitcom Full House. Since the show's finale in 1995, Stamos has appeared in numerous TV films and series. Since 2005, he has been the national spokesperson for Project Cuddle.[2]  From 2005 to 2009, Stamos had a starring role on the NBC medical drama ER as Dr. Tony Gates. In September 2009, he began playing the role of Albert in the Broadway revival of Bye Bye Birdie. From September 2015 to 2016, Stamos starred as the lead character in the Fox sitcom Grandfathered. As of 2016, he is an executive producer of the Netflix series Fuller House, in which he occasionally reprises the role of Jesse Katsopolis.  Early life [ edit ]  John Stamos was born on August 19, 1963 in Cypress, California to William ""Bill"" Stamos, a restaurateur, and Loretta (née Phillips).[3] His father was of Greek descent, and his mother was of English, Irish, and German ancestry. He has two sisters, Alaina and Janeen.[citation needed]  John's paternal grandmother, Adeline Psaras, was born in the United States to Greek immigrants; his paternal grandfather, Ioannis Stamatopoulos, came from the village of Kakouri in the Peloponnese region of Greece and changed the family surname from ""Stamatopoulos"" to ""Stamos"" upon arriving in the United States.[citation needed]  In his youth, Stamos worked for his father's restaurants, and as a teenager had a job flipping burgers in the Orange County area. He attended John F. Kennedy High School and played in the marching band there. At 15, he attended his first Beach Boys concert; a huge fan, he would later tour with the band. His parents were supportive of his aspiration to be an actor, and although he planned to enroll at Cypress College for the 1981 term, he skipped his first semester to focus on launching a career as an actor—with his father's blessing. After just three weeks, he landed his first role on General Hospital.[4]  Acting career [ edit ]  1982–1986: Early career [ edit ]  Stamos began his acting career with the role of Blackie Parrish on the soap opera General Hospital in late January 1982, for which he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1984. That April, he went on to the lead role in the short-lived CBS sitcom Dreams, in which he played an aspiring musician in a band of the same name. Later, he played a cast role in the sitcom You Again? (1986) with Jack Klugman.  1987–1995: Full House [ edit ]  Stamos at the 1990 Grammy Awards  In the late 1980s, ABC's Full House gradually became a hit, and the show solidified Stamos's career. He asked that the character's last name be Katsopolis to highlight his Greek heritage, according to show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin. He played one of the show's protagonists, Jesse, who lives with his brother-in-law, whose deceased wife was Jesse's older sister. Danny's best friend, Joey, also lives in the house with them. The three help each other raise three young girls. Jesse is known to be the ""bad boy"" at first until he falls in love with and marries Rebecca Donaldson and has twin boys, Nicky and Alex. In 1995, after eight seasons, the series came to an end. Stamos has since maintained close relationships with co-stars Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Jodie Sweetin, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Andrea Barber, and Candace Cameron Bure.  1996–2009: Later career [ edit ]  Stamos has appeared in numerous made-for-television films, stage productions, television series, and commercials. He had starring roles in the television series Thieves (2001) and Jake in Progress (2005). Both shows ran for several episodes before cancellation.[5][6] In 2003, Stamos guest-starred on Friends, appearing in the season nine episode, ""The One with the Donor"", playing a man who went to Chandler and Monica's apartment for dinner, not knowing he was actually being interviewed to be a sperm donor. Stamos was a guest star in a first-season episode of MTV's The Andy Milonakis Show (2005), playing himself. He took part in only one skit, which featured him in a tree, having rabies, and being put down by another character. In the A&E television movie Wedding Wars (2006), he starred as Shel, a gay wedding planner. He stated that his performance reflected his support for same-sex marriages.[7]  He has made several voice acting appearances such as in the MTV animated series Clone High in the episode, ""Changes: The Big Prom: The Sex Romp: The Season Finale"", where he played himself, and as the What's Global Warming Penguin in Bob Saget's parody film Farce of the Penguins. In 2005, Stamos guest-starred in two episodes in season 12 of ER as paramedic-turned-intern Tony Gates. In 2006, at the start of ER's thirteenth season, he joined the cast of ER as a series regular. In February 2008, Stamos appeared in the television adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun. In August 2008, he was the roast master for Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget.[8]  2010–present: Grandfathered, Fuller House, and other ventures [ edit ]  On June 8, 2010, it was announced that Stamos would portray Carl Howell, a new love interest for Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), in season two of the popular television show Glee.[9][10] In 2011, Stamos guest-starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit[11] and was featured in a CollegeHumor video with Bob Saget.[12] Stamos also guest-starred as himself on Two and a Half Men as Charlie's old friend, who was interested in buying the house until he found out that the place was Charlie's.  Stamos in 2012  Since 2011, Stamos has appeared in a series of commercials for Dannon's Greek yogurt brand Oikos; including his first Super Bowl commercial which was aired during Super Bowl 2012.[13] In February 2012, it was reported that Stamos would take on one of the lead roles on the new Fox drama Little Brother. The series was created by Everybody Loves Raymond writer Mike Royce, and centers around a man who finds out that he has a long-lost half-brother.[14]  In March 2013, Stamos signed on in a recurring role on the USA Network drama Necessary Roughness, during season three. He played Connor McClane, the head of a sports and entertainment management company that is interested in hiring Dani.[15] Stamos was to play the lead role in ABC's soap opera Members Only,[16] but the network decided not to air the show.[17]  In April 2015, Stamos announced on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that the streaming service Netflix would be picking up Full House for a 13-episode sequel, titled Fuller House, to start airing on February 26, 2016.[18] In September, he began leading the cast of the Fox sitcom Grandfathered, also starring Josh Peck, Christina Milian, and Paget Brewster.[19] In 2016, Stamos appeared in the film My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. In late 2016, he joined the Fox black comedy series Scream Queens in its season two premiere as series regular Dr. Brock Holt.[20]  Music and theatre [ edit ]  Stamos started learning drums when he was four, then began to take up playing the guitar, and started his own band called Destiny. The band had played concerts at some amusement parks and parties.[21]  Independently [ edit ]  Stamos performed on an independently released 1994 album entitled Shades of Blue along with Lanny Cordola, Gary Griffin, Sandra Stephens, Tony Guerrero, and David Enos. Shades of Blue was re-released digitally through iTunes and other channels in 2010 after being long out-of-print.

The 1992 music video, titled ""Forever by Jesse and the Rippers"", featured Stamos predominantly. Three of The Beach Boys members are however briefly shown singing harmonies with Stamos: Carl Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and Mike Love.

"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Leonardo DiCaprio joins the growing list of celebrities getting involved in helping Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has donated $1 million to the newly established United Way Harvey Recovery Fund which will go toward short and long term relief and recovery efforts.  United Way Worldwide said Wednesday that the national fund will distribute 100 percent of donations to recovery efforts for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.  Thousands forced out of their homes due to flooding  ""We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation,"" said United Way Worldwide President and CEO Brian Gallagher in a statement. ""Responding to Hurricane Harvey requires the best of all of us - and that's what this gift represents.""  United Way is the world's largest privately-funded non-profit and anticipates Harvey recovery efforts will take several years.  The $1 million from DiCaprio's foundation represents the inaugural donation to the fund. It is the latest disaster relief support from the Oscar-winner's namesake foundation. DiCaprio and his foundation have previously donated to recovery efforts following the 2004 tsunami, the Haiti earthquake and Hurricane Sandy.  ""We hope others will step up and support the United Way and other organizations,"" foundation CEO Terry Tamminen said in the press release.  Many celebrities have pulled out their pocketbooks to help Harvey victims in recent days including Sandra Bullock, who on Tuesday donated $1 million to the American Red Cross.  Beyonce also pledged to do her part on Tuesday to help her hometown of Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, and other stars, including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and DJ Khaled, are also helping out by donating to the cause after Kevin Hart ""challenged"" them to do so. Johnson, Khaled and Hart each donated $25,000 to Harvey relief. Here's how you can help."	0
"The pop artist tackled the lemon shaker and took lead vocals, while Fallon played a wood block, bass drum and Casio keyboard.  She may be one of the hottest artists in pop right now, but Camila Cabello isn't too cool for school.  Cabello dropped by The Tonight Show studios for a performance with classroom instruments of her international hit ""Havana.""  The pop star tackled the lemon shaker and took lead vocals; host Jimmy Fallon tried his hand at the wood block, bass drum and Casio keyboard; and Questlove looked at ease on the hand clappers.

Lena Dunham may be moving on from her ex-boyfriend Jack Antonoff with a new man.  The 31-year-old Girls creator was photographed with an unidentified companion in West Hollywood on Saturday night, wrapping her arm around him after they had sushi for dinner and headed to a nearby marijuana dispensary. In one shot, the mystery guy affectionately kisses Dunham on her head.  Lena Dunham and a mystery man MEGA  Her rep did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  PEOPLE confirmed in January that Dunham and Antonoff, 33, had split after dating for five years.  Dunham revealed in the March issue of Vogue that she underwent a total hysterectomy last year. She discussed the procedure and the outpouring of “overwhelming” and “heartening” support that she’s received from fans in an emotional Instagram post, aligning the experience to her breakup.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign  up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  “I have a broken heart and I hear those don’t mend overnight,” she wrote. “But we are linked forever by this experience and our refusal to let it hold any of us back from even the grandest dreams.”  Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic  In her Vogue piece, Dunham chronicled the hysterectomy process from start to finish, explaining that she made the decision in the hopes of ending her crippling endometriosis-related pain. After “desperately” trying to manage a “new level of pain” from August to November, Dunham said she finally checked herself into the hospital and refused to leave “until they stop this pain or take my uterus.”  Dunham said the situation wasn’t easy on the former couple.  “My beautiful partner, who has seen me through so much pain with compassion and care, has to be away for work, and I can feel us growing slowly apart, since life is so determined to display its full complexity right now,” she wrote in Vogue. “I am surly and distant. I offer nothing.”  “He reminds me again and again that I am still a woman and still alive,” she continued. “But I also know that soon — for so many reasons that have nothing to do with my uterus — we’ll slip away from each other and I will face everything I am losing in impossibly tiny step.”  RELATED VIDEO: Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Split After More Than Five Years Together  Dunham and Antonoff met in 2012 after being set up on a blind date by Antonoff’s sister Rachel and comedian Mike Birbiglia.  Days after PEOPLE confirmed Dunham and Antonoff’s split, she briefly addressed the breakup during a livestream on Instagram, saying she was still wearing a ring that Antonoff had given her.  “I’ll always wear it because love is a really cool, powerful, eternal thing,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be defined the way that we, in Western culture, define it as beginnings and ends.”  Antonoff has since been linked to Carlotta Kohl; the Bleachers frontman and model sat courtside at a Knicks game a couple weeks ago.	1
New York freelance writerlogged a fun interview withfor Dallas Voice. Celebrity Q&A’s are ultimately all about the questions, and Ferber asked some fabulous ones.  At one point, Gerber picked up on George’s observation that George Michael was once the “Karma Chameleon” singer’s nemesis, exhorting the performer to “be Justin Bieber‘s nemesis!” Prompting this reply:  “No, he doesn’t need me to be his nemesis. He’s his own nemesis! I feel kind of sorry for him. He’s a kid. Who’s taking care of him? That’s the question I want to ask. Who’s taking care of this child? He’s clearly in a bad place, so I don’t want to slag him off. I think he’s beautiful, a beautiful boy. Let’s not pretend here. He’s a beautiful boy.” “He looks like a beautiful dyke. I kind of like that — the whole dykey, androgynous thing he’s got going on. But I feel like everyone’s giving him a hard time and, yes, he’s slightly out of control. Somebody [should] step in.”  We also have to hand it to Ferber for having the guts to ask Boy George if he’s tried Grindr! BG’s answer: “I wouldn’t want to go out with somebody who puts their penis on an App.”	1

Scarlett Johansson had a friendly dinner with Food Network star Bobby Flay over the weekend.  Photographs of the pair strolling out of a restaurant late Sunday night sparked speculation, but a rep for the “Avengers” actress tells us that there’s no romance happening.  “Simply put, they are friends as well as neighbors [in the Hamptons],” says ScarJo’s rep.  Flay, who in 2015 had a publicly contentious split from his wife of 10 years, Stephanie March, was last linked to “Masters of Sex” actress Heléne Yorke.  Johansson, who filed for divorce from French journalist Romain Dauriac in March, has been seeing “Saturday Night Live: Weekend Update” star Colin Jost since May, which was exclusively revealed by Page Six.  The cute couple was together on Sept. 30, when Johansson was spotted dropping Jost off at a star-studded “SNL” after-party at Tao Uptown that included guests like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Dakota Johnson.  This article originally appeared in the New York Post.	1
Just one day after a report surfaced that Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson were spied making out, we’re now hearing that the hunky actor has been after her forever!  If you’re anything like us, when reports first began circulating on Jan. 27 that Robert Pattinson, 31, and Katy Perry, 33, were spotted making out together you pretty much lost your mind! And you’ve got a good reason to! These 2 have been friends forever, they’re some of the hottest celebs in Hollywood and together they’d be the best couple ever! And now we’re now hearing that this reported bit of PDA didn’t come out of nowhere! According to our sources, Rob has been after Katy for a long time! Head here to take a look back at Katy and Rob’s friendship!  “Rob has been majorly crushing on Katy for ages, but she was insistent on them being just friends,” an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Rob wasn’t going to take no for an answer though, and he was determined to win her over. Sure enough, after a prolonged charm offensive, Katy finally gave in, and they’ve been casually dating for a while now. It’s nothing serious at this point, although Rob would definitely love to take things to the next level— but he’s happy to go at Katy’s pace, for now. Rob is crazy about Katy, she’s pretty much his ideal woman—Strong, independent, creative, smart, and sexy—she’s the full package.” We wholeheartedly agree!  As we previously reported, Rob and the pop songstress were seen kissing at the Taix French Restaurant in LA. “They were making out,” a witness told Wonderwall.com. Their onlooker also shared they were being cute and “totally a couple.” Wow! Now we’re dying to see photos of these 2 together!  HollywoodLifers, are you loving these details as much as us?!

"The internet went ahead and killed comedian Trevor Noah again, but he has come out to prove that he is alive and kicking. In fact in true Trevor style he made a joke about the entire fiasco.  Houston News reported that the South African-born comedian had died following a shooting incident at Orlando. The web publication said Trevor was shot while greeting fans after a concert in Orlando.  Some of the details in the story matched that of the tragedy around US musician Christina Grimmie‘s death. The musician was shot dead in 2016 by a ""deranged"" fan as she signed autographs.  This is not the first time Trevor has been a victim of fake news, back in March it was reported that he died after an alleged ""car accident""."	1

"It seems as though there may be more than the normal forces at play here.Former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin was the victim of a horrendous crime this morning while driving to meet a friend on the Pacific Coast Highway. She was run off the road in what authorities are calling a hit and run and nearly killed. The SUV she was driving rolled over several times and ended up in a drainage ditch.Governor Palin was taken to a local hospital under an alias in case the hit and run were on purpose and not a random act of reckless driving. According to her spokesman, she is currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh.The Palin family has been notified and are currently making their way to her bedside. The FBI has been dispatched to the scene to collect evidence. The vehicle that ran her off the road was caught on a traffic camera and is being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the northwest.[adrotate banner=""3""]This is a developing story that will be updated."	1
Nope, still not dating. Hailee Steinfeld clarified her relationship with Justin Bieber during an interview on SiriusXM’s Morning Mash Up on Wednesday, May 3.  The “Most Girls” singer — who was reported to be dating the Biebs after photos of them FaceTiming surfaced last month and they were seen together on Monday — confirmed that she’s not dating the “Love Yourself” singer.  “I don’t know why people make such a big deal,” she said of the rumors. “We’re friends. We’ve been friends for years.”  As previously reported by Us Weekly, Steinfeld is, in fact, still dating her boyfriend Cameron Smoller. The Oscar nominee has been dating the 20-year-old since late last year. After going public with their romance in December, the duo have been sharing sweet snaps on social media ever since.  On April 30, Smoller shared a gorgeous snap of Steinfeld in his car, captioning the sweet snap with three rose emojis. The songstress commented on the post with a heart emoji.  ???

"They swore at the time they were just friends (""We have just stayed close and there's nothing more to it than that,"" she told E! News), but the attraction was growing. By the time a pal was characterizing their coupling as ""more than just a fling"" in early 2016, Bieber was reaching for the right words to define it as well.  You see, he'd learned a bit from his rollercoaster romance with Gomez. He wasn't going to recklessly dive into this union, hands in the air. Though he described the Drop the Mic host as ""someone I really love"" in his February 2016 GQ profile, he was careful not to label the connection they shared. ""I don't want to put anyone in a position where they feel like I'm only theirs, only to be hurt in the end,"" he shared. ""Right now in my life, I don't want to be held down by anything. I already have a lot that I have to commit to. A lot of responsibilities. I don't want to feel like the girl I love is an added responsibility.""  This wasn't about being free to party with groupies, he insisted, but rather a different, and dare we say more mature, way of approaching a relationship. ""I know that in the past I've hurt people and said things that I didn't mean to make them happy in the moment,"" he continued. ""So now I'm just more so looking at the future, making sure I'm not damaging them. What if Hailey ends up being the girl I'm gonna marry, right? If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it's always gonna be damaged. It's really hard to fix wounds like that. It's so hard.… I just don't want to hurt her."""	1
We all know that Lindsay Lohan had a body double in The Parent Trap because, well, there is only one Lindsay Lohan (thank god haha).  Thanks to some crazy cinematic magic, Lohan could be in two places at once for the movie, and play both roles. But for some scenes, someone else actually needed to stand in for her, their face digitally replaced with Lohan’s later on down the road.  Now, say hello to actress Erin Mackey, who played Lohan’s double in the 1998 classic. She really does look like her!  Source: YouTube	0
"The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.  Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.  Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""  According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.  And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time — it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don't have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.""  The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.  The Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair — because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s."	1
Ariana Grande returned to The Tonight Show this week to perform her new single, “No Tears Left to Cry,” once more for the audience. This time, however, she did so accompanied by Jimmy Fallon and The Roots on Nintendo Labo‘s line of cardboard instruments.  It feels like a twist on Fallon’s Classroom Instruments bit.  With Nintendo Labo, Nintendo Switch players can create their own instruments using cardboard sheets combined with their detachable controllers. So with Fallon on the guitar-piano studio and Questlove on robot kit, the late-night TV band was able to lay down some backup for Grande.  The pop singer appeared on The Tonight Show‘s May 1 episode for its entire duration. It was there she performed “No Tears Left to Cry” for the first time on television, after dropping it days earlier and surprising the Coachella audience with a performance of the single.  Now watch the Nintendo Labo rendition above.	0
Ellen DeGeneres is once again trying to bury divorce reports by talking about how much she loves her wife Portia de Rossi. The daytime talk show host gushed about how beautiful Portia is after her People’s Choice Awards this past week.  Ellen and Portia have been struggling to keep their marriage alive these last few months. And now Ellen is apparently trying to squash divorce buzz, despite ongoing media reports about their troubled marriage. Ellen gushed about Portia to reporters backstage at the People’s Choice Awards. In an interview with ET Online, Ellen joked, “It’s such an accident because she normally doesn’t look beautiful like that.” Was Ellen’s joke a backhanded compliment? Did Portia take her comments the wrong way? That’s what fans want to know.  Previous reports indicate that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been dealing with marital issues for months now. In fact, insiders claim that Portia even considered quitting her Hollywood career and moving back to Australia. She simply doesn’t want to deal with any of her marital drama anymore.  Back in November, it was reported that Portia felt suffocated in her marriage. Apparently, Ellen is a different person behind closed doors. Her fans know her as a fun-loving and positive television talk show host, but her friends and family members see it differently. Insiders indicate that Ellen loves to control and micro-manage every aspect of Portia’s life. She feels like she lives in a golden cage simply because Ellen is supposedly pulling all the strings in their marriage.  Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi divorce reports have floated around for months now. Back in July, Ellen even took Portia to the Wimbledon Finals in London just to prove to the media that they were in fact still together.  Of course, this isn’t the first time Ellen has made headlines for her questionable behavior. Earlier this month eyewitnesses claim that Ellen was confronted by a waitress after she failed to leave a tip at a café. Fellow comedienne Kathy Griffin also called Ellen out for her supposed two-face character.  So far, Ellen DeGeneres herself has not made any comments about the divorce reports. Yet, her fans know that the truth will come out sooner rather than later. Do you agree? What are your thoughts? Drop us a line in our comments section below.

"Gigi & Bella Hadid Close Sibling Bond  Gigi & Bella Hadid Pose Naked Together For British Vogue  Gigi and Bella Hadid embrace one another naked on the new March cover of British Vogue and you gotta think it comes at some pretty impeccable timing.

"CLOSE Janet Jackson is being honored with the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday. Time  Janet Jackson, in New York in 2017, says she struggled with depression. (Photo: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP)  Janet Jackson is opening up about life behind ""The Velvet Rope"" in a revelatory letter for Essence magazine previewed on the publication's website as well as ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday.  The 52-year-old singer/actress graces the cover of the magazine's July/August issue which is devoted to happiness. In addition to talking about the joy that her 1-year-old son Eissa Al Mana brings, Jackson writes of the darker times as well.  “When it comes to happiness, I’m no expert,” she writes in the letter. “I have only my life experience as a guide. I’ve known great happiness and great sadness.""  Jackson's 30s were far from perfect, plagued with mental health issues.  “I struggled with depression. The struggle was intense,"" she writes. ""Low self-esteem might be rooted in childhood feelings of inferiority. It could relate to failing to meet impossibly high standards.  ""And of course there are always the societal issues of racism and sexism,"" she continues. ""Put it all together and depression is a tenacious and scary condition. Thankfully, I found my way through it.”  More: Janet Jackson surprises Missy Elliott with Essence honor  Janet Jackson gets personal, opening up about overcoming depression. @dianermacedo has the story about the reigning queen of Rhythm Nation: pic.twitter.com/qHqM42suU9 — Good Morning America (@GMA) June 20, 2018  The following decade was also challenging for her.  “In my forties: Like millions of women in the world, I still heard voices inside my head berating me, voices questioning my value,” she writes.  “Happiness was elusive,"" she adds. ""A reunion with old friends might make me happy. A call from a colleague might make me happy. But because sometimes I saw my failed relationships as my fault, I easily fell into despair.”  In her fifties, however, Jackson has found a source of joy, her baby boy. Even amid a contentious split from Eissa's father, Wissam Al Mana. Early this month, law enforcement performed a welfare check on the child in Al Mana's custody, at Jackson's request. Public Information Officer Deputy Tracy Koerner told USA TODAY no arrests were made.  Jackson's brother Randy previously alleged his sister was verbally abused by Al Mana, a charge lawyers for Al Mana called ""deeply hurtful"" in a statement to People magazine.  But on balance, it seems Jackson has found contentment.  ""The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,"" she says in her letter. ""When I kiss him. When I sing him softly to sleep. During those sacred times, happiness is everywhere.”  The new issue of Essence arrives on newsstands Friday.

There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together.	1

The Anti-Defamation League says Larry David’s Saturday Night Live monologue – in which the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator pondered his dating options in a concentration camp – was “offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time.”  The ADL’s stance, tweeted by the organization’s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, was in line with plenty of Twitterers who started slamming the bit before the show’s cast made its goodnights.  “He managed to be offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at the same time Quite a feat,” wrote Greenblatt.  Watched #LarryDavid #SNL monologue this AM. He managed to be offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time. Quite a feat. — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) November 5, 2017  David’s monologue – watch it above – started out with the comic’s standard self-deprecation, joking about being a total loser during his single New York days. Then he pivoted to riskier territory – Hollywood’s recent flood of sexual harassment allegations.  “I couldn’t help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging, which is that many of the predators are Jews,” said David, whose Curb Your Enthusiasm once included a plot about mistaking Survivor cast members with camp survivors, said. “I don’t like it when Jews are in the news for notorious reasons.”  “I know I consistently strive to be a good Jewish representative,” David said after a crude joke about Harvey Weinstein. “When people see me, I want them to say, ‘Oh, there goes a fine Jew.’”  Then he dove in head first.  “I’ve always been obsessed with women and often wondered, if I’d grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.”  “Hey Shlomo, look at the one by barracks 8,” David continued. “Oh my God, is she gorgeous?!… I’d like to go up and say something to her.  “Of course, the problem is there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp: ‘How’s it going? They treating you OK? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d like to take you out for some latkes.”	1
Kylie Jenner was first spotted with rapper Travis Scott in April 2017 after splitting from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Tyga.  Since first linking up, the couple’s whirlwind romance has included low-key dates, flashy birthday presents and quality time with the KarJenner crew — Scott even got the famous family’s seal of approval. And now, the couple are parents to daughter Stormi.  In honor of the couple’s joint GQ cover, we’re taking a look back at the pair’s relationship.  FIRST SPOTTED TOGETHER AT COACHELLA — APRIL 2017  During an off phase of Jenner’s relationship with Tyga, the reality star was spotted getting cozy with Scott at a Coachella party. “Travis and Kylie have been friends for a while and they all hang out,” a source told PEOPLE at the time. “When she and Tyga are having drama, she tries to make him jealous by hanging out with other guys.”  But it turns out Scott has been close with the Jenner sisters for quite some time: He even performed at Kendall Jenner’s star-studded 21st birthday bash in November 2016.  PACKING ON PDA — APRIL 2017  Bob Levey/Getty  A few weeks after hanging out at Coachella together, the couple seemed to make their love official by getting cuddly at an NBA playoff game in Houston, Texas.  According to an onlooker at the Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder game — where Scott performed before tip-off — the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and the hip-hop artist were spotted holding hands and “definitely looked like a couple.”  “During his performance, Kylie was hiding in the Rockets’ courtside club anxiously waiting for him to come back to her. Once he got back, they definitely looked like a couple, cuddled up next to each other among her friends,” said the onlooker, who attended the game and spotted Jenner kissing Scott’s neck.  A SHOW OF SUPPORT — APRIL 2017  Jenner headed to Bentley University outside Boston to support her beau. Located just outside Boston in the town of Waltham, Bentley was celebrating their annual Spring Day, which always included a big a concert on campus featuring Scott.  Tonight, @KylieJenner was in Waltham with Travis Scott, who headlined Bentley University #SpringDay. pic.twitter.com/8BQvgwCWMP — Only In Boston (@OnlyInBOS) April 30, 2017  Later, the couple headed to Boston’s Theater District where Scott made an appearance at Bijou nightclub  “He was definitely looking for something intimate,” one club-goer told PEOPLE. “They also talked a lot. Like, actually having a conversation. They were dancing at the club. They were definitely super into each other. He didn’t really perform, he just showed up and partied. They left in the same car too.”  GETTING HANDSY — JUNE 2017  GAMR / BACKGRID  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star stopped by the rapper’s Los Angeles home, where the duo were spotted getting handsy with one another. Scott was spotted grabbing the bum of the then-19-year-old Kylie Cosmetics founder, who sported a black sweatshirt, with a red rose-embroidered hoodie, and fitted black leggings. At one point during their romantic embrace, Scott lifted up the reality star into the air as they snuggled up in front of the black Cadillac SUV outside of his residence.  MATCHING INK — JUNE 2017  Kylie Jenner Snapchat  Jenner and Scott attended Khloé Kardashian‘s 33rd birthday party at TAO in Los Angeles, where they were “all over each other,” said the source.  “They recently got matching butterfly tattoos on their ankles that they were showing off to their friends and family,” the insider added. “They were super affectionate and Travis was constantly kissing Kylie on the cheek and whispering in her ear. Their relationship seems to be getting stronger and they’re closer than ever.”  Jenner also went on to get an ankle tattoo (in tribute to ex Tyga) redone — transforming what once was a lowercase “t” to a lowercase “la.”  MATCHING RINGS — JUNE 2017  CPR/Premiere/BACKGRID  First matching tattoos, now this?! Jenner and Scott seemed quite determined to make their love known, and their latest romantic display came in the form of matching rings. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and the rapper were spotted out in Los Angeles, both wearing sparkling bands on their ring fingers.  RELATED: Is This When Travis Scott Found Out Kylie Jenner Was Pregnant with His Child?  BIRTHDAY BLING — AUGUST 2017  BACKGRID  On her 20th birthday in August, the Life of Kylie star enjoyed a low-key family celebration at home before hitting a movie theater with Scott. But what fans were quick to point out was the fact that Jenner was sporting some new bling — a very sparkly new diamond necklace, which was a birthday gift from her rapper-boyfriend.  SEAL OF APPROVAL — AUGUST 2017  INSTARimages.com  RELATED PHOTOS: All the Outfits Kylie Jenner Has Worn to Hide Her Pregnancy  Though Jenner and Scott’s relationship was still rather new at the time, her family was definitely on board with the romance: A source told PEOPLE in August that the KarJenner crew “loves Travis.”  “Kylie and Travis are doing great,” said the source. “There’s no drama with Travis. He’s a cool guy.” “He treats Kylie with a lot of respect and love,” added the source. “Kylie is very happy.”  BABY ON BOARD — SEPTEMBER 2017  In September, multiple sources told PEOPLE the Kylie Lip Kit creator was pregnant with her first child. “They started telling friends a few weeks ago,” said the source. “The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis.” Another source close to the family told PEOPLE: “It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about.”  NEW PARENTS — FEBRUARY 2018  After months of keeping fans in the dark, Jenner confirmed pregnancy rumors and announced she and boyfriend Scott had welcomed their first child, daughter Stormi Webster, together on Feb. 1.  “After the baby was born, Kylie was relieved that the moment was finally here,” a source told PEOPLE. And even though the delivery room was “a bit chaotic with all the family and friends around,” the source added that the 20-year-old “was overwhelmed in a good way — overwhelmed with the joy, love and support everyone was giving to her and Travis.”  HAPPY TIMES — FEBRUARY 2018  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star became a first-time mom on Feb. 1 when she welcomed daughter Stormi with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, who has his own place but is co-parenting with Jenner. “Despite being new parents, Kylie and Travis are still in a new relationship too. Kylie is happy with their living situation,” a source close to Jenner told PEOPLE. “Travis is a great dad. When he wants to work, Kylie is supportive.” The source added that the Kylie Lip Kit creator “has everything she needs right now and seems very happy.”  HOT WHEELS — MARCH 2018  Kylie Jenner/Instagram  Showing off two sleek and shiny new cars, Jenner hinted that the vehicles were meant for her and her boyfriend when she captioned the shot, “mom and dad.” While one of the vehicles is a bright orange Lamborghini Aventador, the other appears to be a matching model in a darker hue.  BIRTHDAY BOY — APRIL 2018  Kylie Jenner/Instagram  To celebrate boyfriend Travis Scott’s 26th birthday on April 30, Jenner had a private party at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles, which was attended by her sisters Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian West and her husband Kanye West. “Rented out six flags for baby’s birthday,” she wrote alongside a video of the start of one of the night’s many roller coaster rides on her Instagram Story. “They’ve never been.”  COVER STARS — JULY 2018  Ronald Martinez/Getty  Gracing the cover of GQ’s August issue, Jenner and her boyfriend are opening up about how they first met, how their lives have changed since they welcomed daughter Stormi — and whether they’re worried about the so-called “Kardashian curse,” the belief that all the men who date a member of the famous family ultimately end up derailing.  “I don’t even be looking at motherf—ers,” he told the magazine. “I don’t be looking at s—. Kylie actually likes me for me. Man, hell nah. Nervous for what? I’m on my own island. So hey, come over there to Astroworld. I’m not into all the other s—. I don’t get involved. I’m over here. Kylie is different.”	1

Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Elle King‘s wedding day was anything but textbook.  On Saturday, the “Ex’s and Oh’s” singer was set to wed fiancé Andrew “Fergie” Ferguson but was actually at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Seattle instead.  “Skipped out on my wedding. I married Rock&Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F–KING DEATH METAL,” King shared on Instagram.  The daughter of comedian Rob Schneider, King, 27, accepted Ferguson’s proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. As King recalled on a March episode of “Say Yes to the Dress,” Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met.  “We met in London in the lobby of my hotel, and it was like we had known each other for 10 years,” she said. “We hung out all night, it was my last day in London, and he was like, ‘You can’t go home.’ And I didn’t get on my flight, and I stayed in London. Two days later, he quit his job and moved to America.”  While she found her dream dress, King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28.  “Gotta say … no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it’s hard to not smile in this California sunshine,” she wrote.  Earlier this month, King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth.  “Been a really rough and insane start to this year,” King shared, along with a snapshot of her puppy. “Lately I don’t cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She’s my best friend and the only true loyalty I’ve ever known.  “Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself. But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don’t give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts,” she continued. “Always be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you’re beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness. Be safe. Be smart. Don’t let anyone make you feel fearful or small. Love yourself.”  A rep for King did not immediately return a request for comment.	0

"Music icon Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have been dating for more than a year, and the couple made a recent high-profile appearance together at the Met Gala, where A-Rod couldn't stop Instagramming.  Lopez visited The Tonight Show on Wednesday, and host Jimmy Fallon and Lopez broached the topic of marriage after playing a clip of Lopez's new song, El Anillo, which translates to ""the ring.""  When Fallon poked fun at A-Rod for stalling and asked if he was watching, J-Lo said there was ""no pressure.""  ""I feel like there's a point that all women get to where they're like, 'What's up?' It's like, we're good, everything's great, what's going on? Am I staying or am I…?""  If A-Rod and J-Lo do tie the knot, it seems likely that it'll happen sooner than later. J-Lo asked Fallon how long he dated his wife before their engagement, and Fallon revealed that the couple had been together for three years.  ""That's a lot. I feel like you know after… fairly quickly. So the rest is just like you being scared and whatever. But don't go by me, I've made tons of mistakes.""  Interestingly, A-Rod will be a guest on Thursday's episode of The Tonight Show. Could he possibly be planning an on-air proposal?  Congratulations to the happy couple, who have an incredible (and slightly awkward) first-date story.  via Vanity Fair:  ""She told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,"" Rodriguez says. ""I had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.""  ""So I'm sitting there and he's walking back, and I get a text,"" Lopez continues. ""It says . . . "" She looks significantly at Rodriguez. ""You can tell her!"" he says. "" 'You look sexy AF,' "" she tells me.""

Original American Idol winner Clarkson joined the show for the current season, and 2004 Idol finalist Hudson returns after serving as a coach during Season 13 last fall. Their teams will square off against those of Blake Shelton and Adam Levine, both of whom have been with the show since its 2011 launch.  NBC  “We are so excited to welcome back Kelly and Jennifer, two dynamic forces who bring undeniable soul, passion and inspiration as coaches” said Paul Telegdy, President of Alternative and Reality Group at NBC Entertainment. “They each have a unique understanding of what it’s like to be in the artists’ shoes.”  Rookie coach Clarkson, who will host the Billboard Music Awards on NBC next week, currently is guiding her performers in The Voice semifinals. Hudson, who was a judge on The Voice UK last year and this year, is starring in MGM’s Aretha Franklin biopic after being handpicked for the role by the Queen of Soul herself.

"If you're a Teen Mom: OG fan, then by now, you've probably heard the news that Amber Portwood and Matt Baier have broken up.  Fans have been hoping these two would part ways pretty much from the day they went public with their relationship, and now that Amber has a new boyfriend, it seems it's safe to say she and Matt are well and truly over.  But while TMOG viewers may be thrilled by the split, Matt is most definitely not.  The newly single Baier opened up about his split from Amber in a recent interview with E! News:  ""I'm trying to do a lot of work on myself because I realize now the downfall of our relationship was my fault,"" he explained.  ""When you're thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.""  Baier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren't on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:  ""What I've learned from this is you have to do the work,"" he told the outlet.  ""You have to make the person you're with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I'm paying the price.""  Matt says he's full of regrets over the way his relationship played out, and if given a second chance, he would change everything about the way he behaved.  ""If I got a do-over,"" he said, ""I would do everything differently. I should have listened to her more.""  The couple was filming a new season of the We TV reality series Marriage Boot Camp at the time of their split.  Matt left the set ahead of schedule and took off for Vegas - where he's apparently been living ever since.  ""I went to Vegas to get my head around the split. Ultimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues. Obviously, that didn't happen.""  But despite the fact that Amber is in a new relationship, Matt is still hopeful that she'll find her way back to him:  ""I'll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends,"" Baier says.  ""We started off as best friends and that's what I miss the most from her—her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.""  As though that's not depressing enough, Baier concluded the info with some insights into his day-to-day life post-Amber:  ""I've been making a living through my [poker] winnings,"" he says.  ""That said, I'm not really enjoying it. This isn't the life I want to live.""  Yeesh. Matt may not have been the perfect boyfriend, but here's hoping he's able to pull himself out of what sounds like a pretty considerable funk.  Watch Teen Mom: OG online to relive Matt and Amber's tumultuous relationship."	0

"The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films are an American series of superhero films based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The MCU is the shared universe in which all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007, and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 20 films, with 11 more in various stages of production. It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $17.5 billion at the global box office.  Kevin Feige has produced every film in the series, alongside Avi Arad for the first two releases, Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk, Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films, and Stephen Broussard for Ant-Man and the Wasp. The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Many of the actors, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson signed contracts to star in numerous films.  The first film in the series was Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures. Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008). Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures began distributing the films with the 2012 crossover film The Avengers,[1] which concluded Phase One of the franchise. Phase Two includes Iron Man 3 (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Ant-Man (2015).

Free from his captors, he decides to upgrade and don his armor in order to hunt down weapons that were sold under the table.[16]  In April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau to direct Iron Man,[4] with the writing teams of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing competing scripts.[4][17] Favreau consolidated both into one script, which was then polished by John August.[5] Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the title role in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part.[18] Principal photography began on March 12, 2007,[19] with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan,[20] which was filmed in Inyo County, California.[21] Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California,[22] with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base[23] and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[24] Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008,[25] and was released internationally on April 30, and in the United States on May 2.[26][27]  The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who approaches Stark regarding the ""Avenger Initiative"". Favreau said that he included the scene as ""a little tip of the hat for the fans...a way to sort of tee up The Avengers."" Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.[28] Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.[29]  The Incredible Hulk (2008)  After being exposed to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross. Hunted by the military, Banner seeks to cure himself and prevent his condition from being weaponized.[30]  In January 2006,[31] Marvel reclaimed the film rights for the Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk.[32] Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films.[32] Instead of moving forward with a sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot.[6] Leterrier initially turned down the job out of respect for Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on.[6] The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film.[33] In April 2006, Edward Norton entered negotiations to portray Bruce Banner and rewrite Penn's script,[34] although Penn received sole credit for the screenplay.[7] Production began on July 9, 2007 and filming primarily took place in Toronto,[35] with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro.[36] The film premiered at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 8, 2008, and was released on June 13.[37][38]  The film takes place simultaneously with the events of Iron Man 2 and Thor,[39] the former of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Downey said that the filmmakers ""were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. The great thing is he—and I don't want to give too much away—but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really fun seeing him play this really powerful character who's half in the bag.""[41] In addition, Captain America is briefly seen frozen in ice in an alternate opening of the film, included in the DVD release.[42]  Iron Man 2 (2010)  Iron Man and Iron Man 2, helped establish the shared universe concept with his inclusion of Samuel L.

The film is set six months after the events of Iron Man,[40] and takes place simultaneously with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Thor.[39] The filmmakers continued to refer to other Marvel films by again including Captain America's shield. Favreau explained, ""We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. So now it really was in his room, so we had to figure out how to deal with the reality that the shield was in his workshop.""[29] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one pointing toward a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther.[56] A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts.[57][58] The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.[59]  Thor (2011)  Thor, crown prince of Asgard, is banished to Earth and stripped of his powers after he reignites a dormant war.

About his role in Thor he stated, ""Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [had] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [chose] to put him more into the universe of it.""[71] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor.[72] Branagh said that they ""were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp"", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role.[73] The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract.[74] The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers.[75] Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.[76]  Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)  In 1942, Steve Rogers is deemed physically unfit to enlist in the U.S. Army and fight the German Reich in World War II.

That's what we're dealing with here.""[127] Bruce Banner appears in a post-credits scene, with Ruffalo reprising the role.

The events of those two films and The Incredible Hulk were ultimately set around the same time,[39] six months after the events of Iron Man.[40] This was not part of Marvel's long-term plans for the shared universe, especially as the studio became busy making more films per year.[39] The official tie-in comic Fury's Big Week confirmed that The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor all took place within a week, a year before the modern-day scenes from Captain America: The First Avenger which lead into the crossover film The Avengers. Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received ""the seal of approval"" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.[346] As promotion ahead of the release of The Avengers, Marvel released an official infographic detailing this timeline in May 2012.[345]  With Marvel no longer trying to complicate their timeline,[39] the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to The Avengers: Iron Man 3 takes place during Christmas about six months after that film,[124][126] Thor: The Dark World is set one year after it,[138] and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is two years after.[126] Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man ended the phase in 2015, with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.[201] For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so Captain America: Civil War begins a year after Age of Ultron,[235] with Avengers: Infinity War set two years after that.[333] However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually ""happen on top of each other"" while being less ""interlocked"" as the Phase One films were,[309] with Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming beginning a week and several months, respectively, after Civil War;[312][284] Thor: Ragnarok beginning four years after The Dark World and two years after Age of Ultron,[307][308] which Winderbaum said was around the same time as Civil War and Homecoming;[309] Doctor Strange taking place over a whole year and ending ""up to date with the rest of the MCU"";[255] Ant-Man and the Wasp also set two years after Civil War and shortly before Infinity War;[342] and both Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel Vol. 2 being explicitly set in 2014,[164][269] which Feige believed would create a four year gap between Vol. 2 and Infinity War, though the other MCU films do not specify years onscreen.[347]  When Spider-Man: Homecoming was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not line-up, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of Homecoming into the previous films, such as connecting it to The Avengers.[348] This was labelled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of The Avengers and the events of Civil War, which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline in which only four years should have passed.[285] Additionally, dialogue in Civil War indicates that eight years pass between the end of Iron Man and the events of that film, which also does not line-up with the established continuity which was closer to five-and-a-half years.[349] Infinity War co-director Joe Russo described the Homecoming eight years time jump as ""very incorrect"",[350] and the mistake was ignored in Infinity War which specified that its events were taking place only six years after The Avengers.[351] The public response to the Homecoming mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,[352] and in November 2018, a timeline specifying dates for the films' events was released as part of the sourcebook Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the MCU.[353]  Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years timeline from November 2018[353] Year(s) Feature films 1943–45 Captain America: The First Avenger 2010 Iron Man 2011 Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor 2012 The Avengers, Iron Man 3 2013 Thor: The Dark World 2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 2016 Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2016–17 Doctor Strange 2017 Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War  This timeline ignores the two ""eight-year"" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of Black Panther and Infinity War by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of Screen Rant described the timeline as ""the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set"", bringing ""some sense of balance to the MCU continuity"".[353] Following Infinity War, the Russo brothers said future films would not necessarily be set according to real time as there are ""a lot of very inventive ways of where the story can go from here"", with both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel set earlier in the timeline.[354]  Recurring cast and characters  List indicator(s) This table only includes characters which have appeared in multiple film franchises within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and have appeared in the billing block for at least two films.

In October 2016, Feige said it was a combination of knowing what films would occupy the 2020 dates and allowing some flexibility, saying, ""We know what [films] we'd like them to be for 2020. Over the years, where we're aiming we've been lucky enough that it's usually been the same thing but we always leave ourselves the opportunity to bob and weave and adapt if we have to. But we know where we're headed for 2020 and we have ideas and we're beginning to solidify the years beyond that.""[516] Feige and Marvel have additional storylines planned through 2028,[517] resulting in 20 films ""on the docket that are completely different from anything that's come before—intentionally.""[518]  In October 2014, in terms of Phase Four films, Feige said, for the time being, ""We're not going to talk specifically about the story of any of those films, the plot of any of those films, what happens to any of the characters in any of those films. In fact, even to talk about any of those characters – who will be involved in those movies – will be a bit of a spoiler as to what may or may not happen to them in earlier movies.""[190] In April 2016, Feige added, ""We're only working on what's been announced through the end of 2019. And it is still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond.""[519] A year later, Feige noted, ""We have an idea [of what the MCU looks like post-Infinity War], and it's gonna be very, very different"", but cautioned that Marvel would not be ""actively discussing anything past [Avengers: Endgame]"" besides dating the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and that James Gunn would be working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.

"CLOSE Police body cam footage shows Shia LaBeouf arguing with officers in Savannah, Georgia, during his arrest for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct and obstruction. He later tweeted an apology saying he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his behavior. USA TODAY  Shia LaBeouf at the premiere of 'Man Down' in Los Angeles on Nov. 30, 2016. (Photo: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)  Shia LaBeouf is apologizing for his actions, and acknowledging that he's ""struggling with addiction.""  In a tweet sent Wednesday, he wrote ""I am deeply ashamed of my behavior and make no excuses for it.""  The actor, who's out of jail on a $7,000 bond, continued, ""I don't know if these statements are too frequent, or not shared often enough, but I am certain that my actions warrant a very sincere apology to the arresting officers, and I am grateful for their restraint. The severity of my behavior is not lost on me.""  LaBeouf was arrested for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct and obstruction last weekend, and video footage of the incident has surfaced.  In the body cam footage recorded by police, the Man Down star can be seen asking authorities why he is being apprehended.  ""I have rights. I'm an American,"" he says. ""You've got me in my hotel, arresting in my hotel for doing what, sir?""  When an officer asks if they can talk, LaBeouf declines from the backseat of a cop car. ""Take these cuffs off,"" he demands. ""I am (expletive) American. I pay my taxes. Get this (expletive) off my (expletive) arms.""  ""Who you fighting for?"" LaBeouf continues antagonistically. ""You got a president who don't give a (expletive) about you, and you stuck in a police force that don't give a (expletive) about you. So, you want to arrest — what, white people who give a (expletive), who ask for cigarettes?""  In this July 8, 2017 photo released by the Chatham County Sheriff's Office, actor Shia LaBeouf poses for a booking photo, in Savannah, Ga.

""I came up to you asking for a cigarette, you dumb (expletive). Why would I ask for a cigarette if I was racist, you stupid (expletive)? I was asking for a cigarette. You said, 'No.' I said, 'Word.' And then you arrested me, you dumb (expletive).""  He also throws his fortune in the officer's face. ""I got more millionaire lawyers than you know what to do with, you stupid (expletive).""  In LaBeouf's apology tweet, he says that his behavior is ""a new low"" for him.  ""My outright disrespect for authority is problematic to say the least, and completely destructive to say the worst,"" he says. ""I have been struggling with addiction publicly for far too long, and I am actively taking steps toward securing my sobriety and hope I can be forgiven for my mistakes.""  The arrest is the second for the actor in 2017. In January, he was handcuffed outside of the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens after getting into a scuffle at the site of his He Will Not Divide Us anti-Trump art project.

From bridesmaid to bride.  With Pippa Middleton’s wedding to her hedge fund manager fiancée James Matthews scheduled for mere weeks away, we’ve put together every confirmed detail about the impending nuptials.  The date  The couple will tie the knot on May 20, 2017.  The ceremony location  The wedding ceremony is said to be an intimate moment taking place in her family’s village church of St Mark's in Englefield, Berkshire. Berkshire is located about an hour out of London and is where Pippa and Kate's parents, Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton live. St Mark's Resident priest Rev Nick Wynne-Jones will officiate the ceremony, a spokeswoman at the church has told The Telegraph.  The reception location  The reception will also be an intimate affair, held in the Middleton’s back garden. According to E!, the family home is an-acre Georgian Grade II-listed manor home. A giant glass marquee has now been erected at the back of Pippa Middleton’s family home in the lead up to her wedding, fit to host 350 guests.  The Bachelorette party  It happened back in March: Pippa chose to go skiing with sister Kate Middleton and close friends at the French resort Meribel. Pippa picked the ski destination as her choice of getaway and as this source cited to The Sun, it was a small yet super luxe getaway: “Pippa loves skiing, so it was her first choice for a hen weekend. They stayed in a really exclusive catered chalet with maids and chef, who ensured that they were totally spoilt. The owners also wanted to impress their royal guests, so the girls were showered with gifts. They were given Swatch watches, Ugg slippers, leather-bound notebooks, and bespoke fragrances. It was a very small, private party, and they had an amazing time.” Learn how to do a Hens night like Pippa here.  The wedding party  The Middleton’s 27-year-old brother James Middleton is set to join Pippa's fiancé's three siblings to form the groomsmen, according to E!. There is no confirmation yet as to who will join Pippa. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be taking on the roles of pageboy and bridesmaid respectively.  The role of Kate Middleton  Back in November of last year, royal author, Judy Wade weighed in on the nuptials saying Kate will most likely not be playing any formal part in the wedding, as it would detract from her sister. Kate's name has been omitted from a list of official duties for the wedding released by Kensington Palace, which details Prince George and Princess Charlotte's roles. Royal experts are suggesting she will still play a smaller role, perhaps by giving a reading during the ceremony.  The guests  The couple has settled on 150 guests. Prince Harry is definitely attending and is bringing Meghan Markle. Pippa and Kate’s business entrepreneur brother James Middleton is attending and bringing his partner Donna Air. The groom’s reality television star brother, Spencer Matthews, who stars on Made In Chelsea, is coming, along with sister Nina Mackie. Spencer will also serve as the groom’s best man at the nuptials. Spencer’s girlfriend however, Vogue Williams, did not receive an invite. According to The Mirror, tennis star Roger Federer has confirmed he is attending the relaxed nuptials. Both the bride and groom are enthusiastic tennis fans, and Pippa has previously attended Wimbledon as a guest of Federer’s. British broadcaster Ben Fogle has also received an invite to the wedding of the year.  The wedding work-out  Middleton has been undertaking a combination of yoga, pilates, dance and spin classes at the exclusive Grace Belgravia health club in London.  The dress code  Pippa Middleton has set an interesting dress code for guests. Middleton is requesting her guests pack one outfit for the ceremony, set to take place at St Mark’s church, Englefield, Berkshire, and another outfit for the reception, which is reported to be taking place at her parents’ home.  The arrival  The Sun has reported Pippa Middleton will arrive at her wedding in a horse-drawn carriage.  The dress  Giles Deacon is the favorite after he was spotted meeting Pippa and her mother last November. “I can never really comment on rumours,” he told Hello!. “Until things are confirmed it's just rumors.” Royal experts have also picked Jenny Packham and Victoria Beckham as favourites to dress Pippa. See our dress predictions here.  The beauty look  Just four days before Pippa Middleton’s wedding, Kate Middleton's hair stylist Amanda Cook Tucker has been spotted wheeling a suitcase into Pippa's Kensington home. According to The Daily Mail, Cook Tucker has spent time inside Pippa and James's home, likely creating a wedding day look for Pippa. Duchess Kate Middleton's personal hair stylist, Cook Tucker, is known for her elaborate up-dos and so royal watchers are tipping this means she is creating one of her classic looks for Pippa on her wedding day.	0

Last year, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps smashed an ancient record when he swam the 200-meter individual medley in 1 minute and 54.66 seconds.  And then for a brief window on Thursday evening, 330 million Twitter users slid into a world without @realDonaldTrump.  President Donald Trump’s Twitter account — from which he aggressively confronts those who displease him, suggests North Korea “may not be around much longer!” and promotes Trump Tower taco bowls — disappeared.  Twitter initially posted a statement Thursday night saying Trump’s “account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.”  Earlier today @realdonaldtrump’s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again. — Twitter Government (@TwitterGov) November 3, 2017  For those few minutes, visitors to Trump’s account were simply met with the message, “Sorry, that page doesn’t exist!”  “The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored,” the statement read. “We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.”  But then two hours later, Twitter updated its statement saying that an investigation showed the deactivation “was done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee’s last day.” Twitter said it would be conducting a full internal review.  The company’s tweet: Earlier today @realdonaldtrump’s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.  Trump has used the account since March 2009. He has tweeted more than 36,000 times and has 41.7 million followers.  Trump has spoken publicly about his reliance on Twitter before. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network last month, Trump credited his use of social media as among the reasons he was elected.  “You have to keep people interested also,” he said. “You know, you have to keep people interested.”  Twitter also serves as among Trump’s main tools for deflecting criticisms and attacks. In the same interview, Trump said that “When somebody says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it.”  Trump conceded that those close to him try to steer him away from social media. But he insists on tweeting — spelling errors included — as a weapon against “fake news.”  Trump’s account may have been “inadvertently” deactivated Thursday, but Twitter has also had to defend its decision not to take down particular presidential tweets.  In a six-tweet thread in September, Trump issues what some took as a threat directed at North Korea.  “Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” Trump wrote.  As The Post has reported, Twitter prohibits tweets that include violent threats, which some argued was Trump’s intention.  Twitter responded saying a number of factors go into account when evaluating controversial content, including its “newsworthiness” and whether it has “public interest.”  Those tweets confronting North Korea followed other instances where critics called for Trump’s account to be more closely controlled, such as when he tweeted an edited video of himself beating somebody up, the victim’s face replaced by a CNN logo.  And then there are the accounts that Twitter has chosen to suspend. Last month, the actress Rose McGowan took to Twitter to challenge Ben Affleck on his claim that he knew nothing of Harvey Weinstein’s decades-long history of sexual assault and violence towards women.  “You lie,” McGowan wrote in one tweet.  But another tweet led to the temporarily suspension of her account. Despite initially declining to comment on the content of that specific tweet, Twitter later explained that McGowan’s “account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service.”  On Thursday alone, Trump used his account to congratulate the Houston Astros for winning the World Series, call on Congress to “TERMINATE” the diversity visa lottery and announce the nomination of Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve.  Trump was back tweeting at 8:05 p.m., praising the day’s “Great Tax Cut rollout.”  “The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!”  It was as if he never left.	0
There is a new report that claims Kendall Jenner warned her rumored new boyfriend Blake Griffin to stay away from her family. This is completely fake news. The false rumors say that the model is worried about the Kardashian-Jenner clan driving the NBA star away, but there is no truth to any of this.  Gossip Cop was the one that found out where things really stand between the two.  Marni to the rescue A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 15, 2017 at 10:59am PDT  Kendall and Blake haven’t even confirmed yet that they are dating, but the pair was indeed spotted together on various outings in the past few weeks.  On Ok!’s website there was an article posted where she says that she is worried about her family interfering in her love life and as a result, she advised Blake to stay away from her sisters and mom.  A so-called source tells the magazine, ‘He’s been invited over to Kris’s for dinner numerous times, but Kendall’s told him to ignore the invites and keep away.’  The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say Griffin isn’t totally comfortable shunning the Kardashians because he’s ‘worried he’s being rude, but ultimately he trusts Kendall’s judgment because the last thing he wants is to be cursed like Caitlyn [Jenner], Lamar Odom and so many others.’  it's here! LIMITED EDITION DropThree available exclusively @saks #KK❤️SAKS A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 12, 2017 at 9:41am PDT  As for Griffin’s inner circle, the seemingly phony source further alleges, ‘His friends don’t think much of Kendall, who they see as stuck up and annoying.’  Advertisement  Gossip Cop also checked in with a source close to the whole situation who assures everyone that the outlet’s article is completely bogus. This is not the first time that the magazine presents false reports surrounding Kendall and Blake’s apparent relationship.	1

Suri Cruise has begged her famous father Tom, “Daddy, come home!”  RadarOnline.com exclusively learned their strained relationship could be repaired after she implored him to visit her, a source said.  Suri, 12, whose mom is Tom’s ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes, 39, has been contacting her dad through a series of heartbreaking letters, calls and voicemails, the insider has revealed.  PHOTOS: Aircraft Simulator & Spy Towers: Tom Cruise Builds His OWN Scientology Lair  Although Katie’s rep has denied it, according to the source, the little girl has begged Tom, 56, to come and visit and the Mission Impossible star has finally responded to Suri.  “He’s contacted Suri through a third party, who he trusts implicitly, to check in and make sure she’s okay,” the spy said. “He wants her to know that he’s thought of her all this time and that he got all of her messages. In fact, he read and listened to each and every word.  “Tom’s paving the way to come back into Suri’s life permanently—and many expect it to happen soon.”  PHOTOS: Tom Cruise Through The Years  In June 2012, Holmes ended her marriage to Tom and things have reportedly been hard between him and Suri ever since.  A second source said of Tom, “He was absent for one milestone after another” in Suri’s life.  Although Holmes is constantly photographed with her daughter, fans have wondered why Tom is so rarely seen with Suri.  PHOTOS: Packing On The Pounds? Tom Cruise UNRECOGNIZABLE In New Photos  “That would be painful for any child—you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it [took] on Suri,” the source said.  The Church of Scientology requires members to “disconnect” with those who leave the controversial faith and “Tom couldn’t reach out [to Suri] before because Katie fled the religion,” the source said.  Tom, a top celebrity in Scientology, “believes he can bypass the rigid rule.”  The superstar is building a home base in Florida to help build up Church membership, “but what he’s really doing is setting the stage for a reunion with Suri,” the insider explained.  PHOTOS: Tom Cruise’s 21-Year-Old DJ Son Spinning Out Of Control — CAUGHT Cavorting With Semi-Clad Women  Suri has “made a plea to Katie to let her see her dad,” and Katie, who recently denied that she has split from longtime boyfriend Jamie Foxx, is all for it.  “Katie would never stand in the way of Suri having a relationship with her father. If that’s what Tom wants, the better.”  The source added that Tom “feels like he’s missed out so much. He wants her to be a part of his life.”  We pay for juicy info!

"The 'Grace and Frankie' star will appear as prosecutor Jack McCoy later this season.  Jack is back.  Sam Waterston, who starred on Law & Order for 16 seasons, will reprise his role as prosecutor Jack McCoy on Law & Order: SVU, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.  The actor will guest-star on an upcoming episode of the NBC spinoff's 19th season, which kicks off Sept. 27. The role reunites him with new SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin, who worked on Waterston's first two seasons of the mothership and helped create the character of Jack McCoy. Fellow SVU exec producer Julie Martin also worked on the final season of the original series.  Waterston joined the NBC legal drama in its fifth season and stayed through the drama's 20th and final season. NBC then abruptly canceled the series in 2010 — one season before Law & Order could break Gunsmoke's record for longest-running primetime drama.  Law & Order's abrupt cancellation means the writers were unable to wrap up storylines for Jack and the other characters. (Fellow longtime cast member S. Epatha Merkerson had already planned to exit at the end of season 20 and was given an emotional final season arc in which her character battled breast cancer.)  This will actually be Jack McCoy's fourth appearance on SVU following several crossovers in the early aughts. In recent years, SVU has welcomed back other characters from the mothership including prosecutors Connie Rubirosa (Alana De La Garza) and Michael Cutter (Linus Roache).  During his 16-season stint on Law & Order, Waterston won a Screen Actors Guild award for best actor in a drama series and earned three Emmy nominations in the same category. Since Law & Order, he was gone on to roles in Aaron Sorkin's HBO drama The Newsroom as well as movies including Miss Sloane and Please Be Normal.  In addition to his starring role on the Netflix comedy Grace & Frankie, Waterston will next appear in the Netflix Western miniseries Godless. He is repped by Gersh and Industry Entertainment.  Despite his busy schedule, Waterston expressed interest in reviving Jack McCoy as recently as 2015, when NBC and Dick Wolf were in talks for a potential Law & Order revival. ""Sure, I'd love it,"" Waterston told THR in May 2015. ""Got to break the record.""  Chernuchin also talked to THR about bringing back Jack McCoy earlier this year when he was the showrunner on Chicago Justice. Justice saw the return of several flagship favorites including Richard Brooks, Lorraine Toussaint and Tovah Feldshuh. ""We actually talked for a brief second about having Sam come in, but we thought it was too early,"" Chernuchin told THR in January. ""But maybe in the future.""  However, Chicago Justice was canceled in May after one season and Chernuchin subsequently took over the top job at SVU. In his move to SVU, Chernuchin is bringing an important member of the Law & Order universe with him: prosecutor Peter Stone, the son of Law & Order character Ben Stone, played by Waterston's predecessor Michael Moriarty. Philip Winchester played the role of Peter on Chicago Justice and will join SVU full-time later this season.  ""We've connected all the Dick Wolf shows,"" Chernuchin told THR recently about adding Winchester to the cast. ""The original New York franchise, the Chicago franchise, it's like the small Dickensian universe in London where different characters show up in different novels. That was one of the intriguing things to me by bringing Philip over, is to connect all the franchises.""  Like SVU, which pulls solid numbers in syndication on USA Network, Law & Order continues to live on in repeats on TNT, SundanceTV and WeTV, among other channels.  Law & Order: SVU returns Wednesday, Sept. 27 at 9 p.m."	0

Livingston announced that the family would be expanding into a foursome with a January Instagram photo, in which the Canadian rhythmic gymnast is posing atop a barrel.  “Round and round we go!

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is praising a 10-year-old boy who saved his 2-year-old brother from drowning thanks to techniques the older child discovered by watching San Andreas.  “This story grabbed my heart,” Johnson wrote on Instagram with a screenshot of the news story.  Jacob O’Connor, 10, found his brother Dylan, 2, lying face down in the family pool. After he pulled Dylan from the water, Jacob used CPR to save the child’s life, something he learned from the 2015 blockbuster during a scene where Johnson’s character performs CPR on his daughter. “The movie just popped up in my head and I started thinking about that scene,” Jacob, who lives in Michigan, told the Washington Post. “And that’s when I started doing the compressions.”  “I’m so amazed and impressed by this little [10-year-old] boy’s heroic actions and calm instincts in the middle of that kind of emergency distress,” Johnson wrote. “I now need to shake young Jacob’s hand.”  The star, who’s currently filming Skyscraper in Vancouver, later invited Jacob and his family to the set. In a video posted to Instagram, Johnson said he wanted to meet Jacob and shake the hand of a “real-life hero.”	0

It will be one of his final onscreen performances.  Wilson is survived by his wife, Heavenly, whom he married in 1977.  Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for AMC  Wilson had a long career before appearing as Herschel Greene during the second season of The Walking Dead and becoming one of the show’s most beloved characters to date.  Born in Georgia in 1942, Wilson made his onscreen debut in 1967’s In the Heat of the Night and followed it up later that year with the role of real-life murderer Dick Hickock in an adaptation of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. He played George Wilson opposite Robert Redford in 1974’s The Great Gatsby and earned a Golden Globe nomination in 1980 for his turn in The Ninth Configuration.  Wilson also made memorable recurring appearances on CSI as Sam Braun, the father of Marg Helgenberger’s Catherine Willows, and followed his time on The Walking Dead with roles on Bosch and The OA.  A number of Wilson’s costars shared their thoughts and memories of him following the news of his death Saturday evening.  “The first time I met Scott Wilson, he gave me a big hug and said that this thing I had become apart of… was a family,” wrote TWD‘s Khary Payton on Twitter. “He said I had a responsibility to take care of it. I have tried very hard to do that, sir. & I will continue. I promise. See you on the other side, my friend.”  “Scott Wilson has departed. I am heartbroken. We are fewer. Go easy into the light brother,” wrote Bosch‘s Titus Welliver.  “I just heard the news about the passing of #ScottWilson,” Yvette Nicole Brown said on Twitter. “He was a wonderful man and I am heartbroken. #RIP #Hershel #TWD”  “Scott Wilson was simply the finest actor and more importantly the finest and most decent man I ever knew.

Oprah surprised Tiffany Haddish on ‘The Ellen Show’ and like any sane person meeting Oprah, Tiffany sobbed uncontrollably when her idol stepped out. Watch the clip here!  If you think you’re Oprah‘s biggest fan, think again. Tiffany Haddish proved she loves the Wrinkle In Time star more than anyone else when she cried over her on the Feb. 22 episode of The Ellen Show. While telling a story to Ellen Degeneres about how she was an extra on an Oprah-produced film, the 38-year-old explained that the former talkshow host said to her, “Well, keep me updated on your career, write me, let me know what you got going on.” But the letters always went unanswered. “And so, I would write her, right? She never wrote back,” the Girls Trip star added. Then, Ellen yells out, “Oprah, why didn’t you write back,” and out comes Oprah! Cue a sea of Tiffany’s tears!  After the pair shared the warmest of hugs, they sat down and basically ignored the host of the show. Oprah turned to the comedian and said, “You are so so so good,” which Tiffany hilariously responded between sobs by saying, “Thank you! You told me that before in a dream!” The Keanu star couldn’t contain herself as her idol sang her praise, but when the media mogul explained that she lost her letter, Tiffany called her out with, “But I sent you like six!” We couldn’t love Tiffany anymore than we do after watching this video. Check it out above!  HollywoodLifers, would you also cry literal tears meeting Oprah like Tiffany did?	0
"Mila Kunis donates money every month to Planned Parenthood under the name of Vice President Mike Pence, she recently told talk show host Conan O’Brien.  Her repeated donation under Pence’s name is not a “prank,” she said, but a way to peacefully protest while supporting the organization.  ""I don't look at it as a prank,"" Kunis said. ""I literally -- I strongly disagree -- and this is my little way of showing it. It's a peaceful protest.""  Before she went into detail about her donations, the former “That 70s Show” star told Conan that she might get “a lot of hate mail” and she apologized if her actions offended anyone.  ""It's not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do,"" Kunis said.  ""So as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.""  This was met with loud applause from the audience.  ""Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says, 'an anonymous donation has been made in your name,'"" Kunis said."	0

Workers leave the site of the future Trump International Hotel, which is at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.“It’s something ironic,” said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.“The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.”Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.“Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.“He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation’s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country’s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Several of the laborers — who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day — fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.“Do you think that when we’re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we’re raping or selling drugs?” Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. “We’re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.”In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers.“Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said.Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said.Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.“Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.”A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks.The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel.[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’]At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century.Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.”For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.“Actually,” he reflected, “we’re more American than him.”	0

Kim Kardashian recently revealed that she and hubby, Kanye West, would like to have more children so that daughter North and son Saint will grow up with lots of siblings.  However, the 36-year-old’s first two pregnancies caused significant damage to her uterus and now she’s unable to conceive naturally. Even after a risky surgery to repair the damage, doctors were unable to mend the problem, so now the celebrity couple must look into other options.  On Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the reality star revealed that she’s been “begging” her younger sister Khloe to be her surrogate.  It’s a big ask for anyone, but considering that Khloe has no children of her own yet, we wonder how she’d feel about giving birth to her sister’s child.  If Khloe’s not willing, then it seems the siblings’ mum would be, with Kris Jenner telling Kim “I would do it in two seconds” in a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  Whatever happens, Kim seems determined to have baby number three, so we’ve no doubt she’ll keep exploring her options.  In other news, the reality star recently celebrated her third wedding anniversary with Kanye. The couple kept things low-key, by taking their daughter North to Disneyland in Anaheim for the day.

Royal baby No. 3 is here! Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child on Monday, April 23 at 11:01 a.m. in the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s hospital.    Just like when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stopped for a few quick photos in front of the hospital before they returned to Kensington Palace with their new prince. Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she’s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.

Both dresses were bright red with a white Peter Pan collar.  Getty Images  This wasn't the first time Kate paid homage to her late mother-in-law after giving birth. Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.  Getty Images  When Princess Charlotte arrived in May 2015, Duchess Kate opted for another pastel Jenny Packham number, but this time her yellow dress in a buttercup print had longer sleeves to accommodate for the cooler spring weather just like the red dress did today.  Getty Images  Princess Charlotte also wore a knit cap when she went out into the world for the first time, while Prince George enjoyed the July weather sans-hat on his first outing. Both royal babies were swaddled in a white G.H. Hurt & Son soft wool baby shawl.  The first public appearances of Prince George (L) and Princess Charlotte (R).

Getty Images  The previous two times Duchess Kate stepped out with her newborns she wore light-colored heels, but her Dune sling-back espadrilles were better suited for the July weather than the leather Jimmy Choo pumps she wore to introduce Charlotte.  Getty Images  Duchess Kate went for neutral shoes once again with baby no. 3, opting to re-wear what appears to be her Gianvito Rossi “Gianvito 105” pumps in taupe suede.

Jennifer Garner might have filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, yet she’s apparently still perplexing to make him sceptical by flirting with another male – her co-star, Josh Duhamel.  Jennifer and Josh are operative together on a coming-of-age play ‘Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda’ in Atlanta right now, and according to a news from a National Enquirer, a dual co-stars have grown really close. The Enquirer’s source claims, “Josh is creation her see things in a whole new light, yet Ben insanely jealous, since Josh is even improved looking than he is.”  The source also adds, “[Jennifer has started] ramping adult her flirting with Josh since she gets a disturb out of creation Ben jealous.” It’s not transparent either Josh Duhamel is receptive to this flirting or either he’s oblivious, yet it should be forked out that he’s married to Fergie and has been for utterly some time.  It’s not a fact that Jennifer Garner would be unknowingly of, and given Ben Affleck’s nanny drama and erratic eye, it’s formidable to suppose Jennifer purposefully putting another lady by what she went by with her (now) ex-husband.  However, it’s really easy to suppose Ben Affleck removing possessive and jealous, even yet their subdivision is all yet central now. He and Jennifer are clearly still articulate regularly, and a dual did try for some-more than a year to determine and get behind together. He might have screwed it adult with his inability to get his life together and understanding with his piece abuse issues, yet that doesn’t meant that he doesn’t still have feelings for Jennifer.

Caitlyn Jenner is putting her foot down and has refused to watch Megyn Kelly’s highly anticipated interview with the Kardashian and Jenner clans that is set to air in June.  Last week, pictures surfaced on TMZ that showed Mrs. Kelly, the new face of NBC, on the Los Angeles set of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” after conducting a lengthy interview with Kris Jenner and all of her daughters – Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian.  It was made known that Caitlyn Jenner and Rob Kardashian had opted to skip the chitchat and for obvious reasons, Blac Chyna and Tyga were not invited.  As for Kanye West being absent, no explanation was given – as the saying goes, Kanye does what Kanye wants.

Ever since men and women flooded the Golden Globes red carpet two weeks ago with signs of all-black sartorial solidarity and “Time’s Up” pins, there has been questions swirling around some of the men claiming to be allies of the movement against sexual misconduct. Actress Scarlett Johansson, giving her second barn-burning speech at a Women’s March in as many years, called out Globe winner James Franco on Saturday saying: “I want my pin back, by the way.”  In addition to winning a Golden Globe two weeks ago, Franco, who wore a Time’s Up pin while claiming his prize, also garnered a lot of attention thanks to some comments on social media during the ceremony including some pointed, since-deleted tweets from actress Ally Sheedy. A few days later, the L.A. Times printed a report of five women accusing Franco of sexual misconduct. Franco denied the allegations. The actor has now been publicly addressed by Johansson, one of the original signers of the Time’s Up announcement letter and a major donor to the cause.  Though she didn’t name him directly during her speech in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, a rep for Johansson later confirmed to the L.A. Times that the actress was indeed referring directly to Franco when she said: “How could a person publicly stand by an organization that helps to provide support for victims of sexual assault while privately preying on people who have no power?” Pausing for effect, she then asked Franco for her pin back. Her comments start at the 1:25 mark.  Johansson posed further questions on much-debated topics such as abuses of power and what some deem grey areas of consent before saying she felt a “rage” bubbling up inside her on behalf of women who have been abused and also, she admitted, on behalf of herself.  Johansson then related her own personal experience: “Suddenly I was 19 again and I began to remember all the men who had taken advantage of the fact that I was a young woman who didn’t yet have the tools to say no, or understand the value of my own self-worth,” said Johansson who appeared in her first film at the age of 10. “I had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative that I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out, and that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.”  “No more pandering,” Johansson concluded. “No more feeling guilty about hurting someone’s feelings when something doesn’t feel right for me,” she said. “I have made a promise to myself to be responsible to my self, that in order to trust my instincts I must first respect them.”	0

Talented: Laura made her major film debut playing Peter Parker's high school girlfriend Liz in last year's Spider-Man: Homecoming  Just over a week ago Justin opened up about his split from ex wife Jennifer Aniston, telling the New York Times their separation was different than a normal couple's would have been because it was so 'amicable'.  '[It] doesn't have that seismic shift of an ordinary couple, where everything is, like, you have to tear a baby in half,' he said.  'Neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other. It's more like, it's amicable. It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be. It was heartbreaking only in a sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day.'  The Maniac star went on: 'But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we're both very proud of.'	0
Is the feud over between Brandi Glanville and LeAnn Rimes?  The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star appeared to move past the bad blood with Rimes over the weekend and posted a photo with the singer. They were together to celebrate the 11th birthday of Glanville’s son Jake, who she shares with Rimes’ now-husband Eddie Cibrian.    “Peace in #calabasturd hanging for Jakes bday,” Glanville captioned the photo on Instagram Saturday.  The 35-year-old country singer posted a throwback photo of Jake to celebrate the boy’s birthday but did not repost the selfie with Glanville.  The women haven’t been on great terms since Cibrian cheated on Glanville with Rimes in 2009. Rimes was married to Dean Sheremet at the time.  Rimes and Cibrian left their spouses and got married in 2011.  The “Real Housewives” star told E! News’ “Daily Pop” last June that she believes Cibrian will leave Rimes in the near future. Glanville also admitted her relationship with her ex-husband was “a little rocky” at the time.  Glanville also admitted she was immature following the cheating scandal.  “I think that I’ve acted like a child enough during the seven years,” she told People in 2016. “As the kids are getting older – something did happen with one of them, and I don’t really want to go into it, but it made the three of us, Eddie, LeAnn and myself, realize we have to be together on this.”	0

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are putting in a pool, according to TMZ , which says it obtained copies of building permits for the in-progress pool at the couple's Hidden Hills estate. Aerial photos published by TMZ indicate the pool—reportedly clocking in at 20-by-60 feet—is already well in development, although it's unclear when it will be complete. TMZ also reported that the Wests spent another $12,000 on building a new guard shack. Whether this is specifically to deter would-be skinny-dippers, or if it's just another add-on to their already tight security team, is unclear.  There's no word on who designed the pool, but it would not be surprising if it turned out to be Kanye West himself. In May , the multihyphenate added another hyphen when he announced he was starting a new architecture firm called Yeezy Home. ""We’re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better,"" he wrote on Twitter. As Architectural Digest reported, this wasn't just a ploy to expand his résumé—he worked with Axel Vervoordt on the Hidden Hills home, sharing photos of its Zen Brutalist aesthetic on Twitter.  It would also not be surprising if West got pretty hands-on in the construction of his new pool. In a previous interview with Architectural Digest , Kim Kardashian West revealed that her husband is quite the builder. ""My husband makes all of his own furniture in his office,"" she said. ""My office is all Vincent Van Duysen, but Kanye is so good at it, he loves to draw out pieces. Axel made a couch in our house called the 'Kanye couch' because Kanye designed it with him."""	1
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  Congratulations to Chrissy Teigen and husband John Legend. The couple just welcomed their second child to the world.  And it's a boy!  Teigen made the announcement via Twitter overnight, and what her tweet lacked in details, it made up for in enthusiasm.  ""Somebody's herrrrrrre!"" she wrote.  The brief message was followed by baby and baby bottle emoji, and it was immediately retweeted by proud pop Legend.  The model mom and Grammy-winning musician first revealed they were expecting back in November — with a little help from baby No.1, their 2-year-old daughter Luna.  Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have welcomed their new arrival to the world. Victor Boyko / Getty Images  ""It's John's!"" Teigen hilariously captioned the video reveal.

Reports have surfaced in the Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston split that is just plain bizarre.  Apparently he’s now ‘fallen’ for Selena Gomez.  The Gomez has been mates with both Justin – who’s 21 years her senior – and Jen for years, but apparently things have gone into lover territory for Justin and the singer.  The two do share a manager, we should add, so it may be nothing more than a friendly friendship.  However, sources linked to the pair have gone and suggested the two have ‘totally fallen for each other’ and that Justin’s ex Jen ‘isn’t happy’.  These two have been pals, which isn’t awkward (Picture: Getty Images)  Life and Style has reported the source claimed Justin and Selena (wow, she likes Justins, eh?) have ‘known each other for years through their manager’ but only recently started ‘falling for each other’.  Much falling, very celebrity.  It comes after Justin and wife of two years Jen separated after spending the past seven years together as a couple.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Selena is back on the singles scene, too, reportedly, after her split from Justin Bieber after a few months of dating after reigniting their on/off relationship that has spanned many a year.  Jen and Justin split earlier this year (Picture: WireImage)  When it comes to her reported romance with Justin (Theroux), the source added: ‘Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups.  ‘They FaceTime and text late at night and have intimate conversation about where they’re going in life and their career goals.’  It’s an interesting matching, if it’s at all happening, as Jen and Selena are said to be friends, with the source saying Jen was ‘put out’ as Selena ‘always considered her a mentor’.  The source said: ‘Jen is not happy about it. She’d be horrified if she knew the extent of the relationship because she’d think of it as a complete betrayal on both their parts.’  Just for some posterity, shall we remind you all Selena once said this about Jennifer Aniston:  ‘I always say that I worship Rachel McAdams as a movie actress but for comedy—the whole reason I started my show and mannerisms, they were after Jennifer Aniston,’ she told Just Jared in 2009.  ‘It was so funny, they were playing clip reels of the work she’s done and I quoted the whole thing. Every single thing she’d say, I would say it. People were sitting there laughing at me and they’re like, “Wow, you’re obsessed.'”  Advertisement  Advertisement  Read into that what you will.

You are aware that you’re not finished yet. (Laughter.) Senior year, that’s sometimes tempting. I want you all to stay focused.Over the past couple weeks, I have been --AUDIENCE MEMBER: Happy birthday, Mr. President!THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) It was my birthday two days ago. (Laughter.) Got some singers here.AUDIENCE: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Mr. President. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) I am now 52, and Michelle says that I don’t look a day over 51. (Laughter.)So over the last few weeks, I’ve been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class -- a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.And I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past four and a half years, together, we fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle-class security that had been taking place for decades.But we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a tax code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. (Applause.) We saved the auto industry. We’ve now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure we’re building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)Our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So we’re making progress. (Applause.)So thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, we’ve cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. We’re starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle-class family will tell you, we’re not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.And reversing this trend should be -- must be -- Washington’s highest priority. It’s my highest priority. (Applause.) I want to make sure that in America, it doesn’t matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love -- you should be able to make it when you try. You should be able to make it. (Applause.)Now, unfortunately, for the last year or so, we’ve had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle-class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher.And that’s why I’m traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care that’s there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you’re not rich; the opportunity -- the ladders of opportunity for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises.Now, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle-class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle-class life -- and that's the chance to own your own home. (Applause.) The chance to own your own home.We've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded.I think about my grandparents’ generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's Army -- when he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place where you could build up savings for college, or to start a business, or to retire with some security.And buying a home required responsibility on everybody’s part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses weren’t for flipping around, they weren’t for speculation -- houses were to live in, and to build a life with.And unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldn’t afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst -- triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted.By the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of Ground Zero for the housing bubble bursting.So less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is it's been a long, slow process. The housing market is so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.Where Congress wouldn’t act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.)We worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families -- largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called “liar’s loan.” Now, something that's called a liar's loan is probably a bad idea. (Laughter.)So because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air -- they’re no longer underwater on their mortgages. (Applause.)And just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. (Applause.) So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent.This morning, right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction -- (applause.) We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people -- and they’re hiring even more people -- (applause) -- because the housing market is bouncing back.So that's one of the things about housing. It's not just important for the person who owns the house; our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers, all these folks are impacted by the housing industry.So we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hardworking Americans the chance to buy their first home. (Applause.) We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance.And we’ve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. (Applause.) We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what we’ve got to do. (Applause.)So I’ve already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help accomplish that. And, look, the fact of the matter is Congress hasn’t enacted all of them, so I’d like you to encourage members of Congress to take some of these actions. (Applause.)But like the other actions that we’ve taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldn’t afford, and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck.What we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle-class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hardworking Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them.Number one: Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today’s rates. (Applause.) We need to get that done. We’ve been talking about it for a year and a half, two years, three years. There’s no reason not to do it. (Applause.)Step number two: Now that we’ve made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they can’t afford, let’s make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. (Applause.) So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure we’re simplifying overlapping regulations; we’re cutting red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if they’ve worked hard to repair their credit.And step three is something that you don’t always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. (Applause.)It’s pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. It’s got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. (Applause.) This could help homeownership here.So I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. Let’s go ahead and get this done.Step number four: We should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. Let’s put construction back -- construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. (Applause.) Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their country’s help to get back on their feet.Step five: We should make sure families that don’t want to buy a home or can’t yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. (Applause.) It’s important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and there’s nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties.In the run-up to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren’t ready and didn't have the payments. That’s a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, let’s invest in affordable rental housing. Let’s bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. (Applause.)So if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy -- all these steps will give more middle-class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who aren’t yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy.But -- and this is the last key point I want to make -- as home prices rise, we can’t just re-inflate another housing bubble. I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. (Applause.)And one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really government, but not really private sector -- they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was “heads we win, tails you lose.” And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street.So the good news is, right now there’s a bipartisan group of senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like.First, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist -- I think I saw some posters there on the way in. (Laughter.) But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1st, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. (Applause.)But in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle.A second principle is we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (Applause.) We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well -- well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. (Applause.)The third principle is we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That’s something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. (Applause.)Number four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time homebuyers -- like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives today’s families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.And we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And, by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. (Applause.) The Mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. (Applause.)Since I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way to US Airways, you’re on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. (Applause.)But we've got to keep going, because nobody in America, and certainly no veteran, should be left to live on the streets. (Applause.)So here's the bottom line: Put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the state and throughout the country.We're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. (Applause.) And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when they’re shopping for a mortgage. They’re designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English, so you can actually read it without a lawyer -- (applause) -- although, you may still want a lawyer obviously. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. (Laughter.) There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. (Laughter and applause.)And the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this -- head watchdog for the CFPB. (Applause.) So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners.When it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our nation’s top housing regulator. He is an outstanding member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee -- worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up or down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. (Applause.)So I want to be honest with you. No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multi-trillion dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high, the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. We’ll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation -- a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. (Applause.)And if we stay focused on middle-class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy -- for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity -- then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle-class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to “Open” on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the child’s height on the door of their new home -- with pencil, of course. (Laughter.)We can do all this if we work together. And it won’t be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps -- and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship -- (applause) -- actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. (Applause.)And as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for.Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.)END 1:35 P.M. MST	0
"Gauthier Destenay, the husband of Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, ate dinner and toured a museum with the wives of other NATO nation leaders.  Standing among global first ladies like Melania Trump and France's Brigitte Macron, Luxembourg's proud ""first gentleman"" Gauthier Destenay represented his nation at the Brussels NATO summit on Thursday.  Destenay, a 44-year-old architect originally from Belgium, is the husband of Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg since December 2013. The men married in 2015 after the small European nation legalized same-sex marriage, People reports.  Destenay joined the spouses and partners of other NATO leaders — including Icelandic First Lady Thora Margret Baldvinsdottir and Turkish First Lady Emine Gulbaran Erdogan — at a tour of Brussels's Rene Magritte museum. Destenay was seen having friendly conversations with many of the women, including Trump and Macron. The spouses later convened for dinner at a Brussels restaurant."	0
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  For Father's Day, Behati Prinsloo devoted more than one post on social media to husband Adam Levine — and that's not all.  As a bonus treat for fans, the mom of two even included the first-ever glimpse of new daughter Gio Grace's face.  ""My first baby holding OUR second baby,"" Prinsloo captioned a black-and-while shot of the ""Voice"" coach and Maroon 5 frontman with their 4-month-old cradled in his arms.  Father and daughter trade off big smiles in the sweet photo.  Prinsloo and Levine also have another daughter together, 21-month-old Dusty Rose.  ""Our girls are so lucky to call you dad and I’m so lucky to have you as a husband a lover and a friend,"" she continued. ""We love you. Life is better with you.""

""To my dad, thank you for being the best example to show me what I would want in a husband and father one day, the way you look at mom is the way Adam looks at me, thank you for being the best dad EVER,"" she wrote.  In yet another post featuring a black-and-white photo of Levine, the 29-year-old added, ""There isn’t enough words to express what you mean to us! Crushing life. We love you dada. Happy Father’s Day.""  Before those Sunday tributes, the only look the parents have shared of little Gio was a pic of her feet, uploaded just days after her February birth.  It's the hope of both Prinsloo and Levine that future Father's Days include even more little ones.  During a visit to ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" last November, the rocker admitted that he wants ""a lot"" of kids. ""I thrive in chaos,"" he said. ""I really genuinely enjoy it.""  Then he revealed Prinsloo wants even more than ""a lot.""  ""She wants like 100 babies, but I don't know if I can do that,"" he laughed."	0

The No Doubt singer took to Instagram to share a picture of her country singer beau kissing her cheek.  The loved-up snap is a clear message that their relationship is still on - after claims she was dumped over ""jealousy and drama"" to do with her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.  ""Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,"" a source told In Touch Weekly .  “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""

""Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.""  Mirror Online has contacted Gwen's representative for comment.  Last year, her ex-husband Gavin revealed that he and Gwen went through ""so much counselling"" in a bid to save their marriage.  The 51-year-old former Voice coach split up from the No Doubt singer in 2013 after 13 years of marriage. The couple finalised their divorce in April 2016.  Appearing on Loose Women , Gavin said that they had tried desperately hard to save their marriage.  Gavin said: ""We had so much counselling, so much counselling, I could be a counsellor.  “I tried, I tried hard but that’s the way it goes.

"May 2004  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie meet on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and sparks fly/explode all over the place—specifically, all over Brad's marriage. Angelina later described falling for Brad while filming the movie during an interview with Vogue:  ""Because of the film we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened. I think a few months in I realized, 'God, I can’t wait to get to work.' Whether it was shooting a scene or arguing about a scene or gun practice or dance class or doing stunts—anything we had to do with each other, we just found a lot of joy in it together and a lot of real teamwork. We just became kind of a pair. And it took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think, to realize that it might mean something more than we’d earlier allowed ourselves to believe. And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration."""	1
"(CNN) George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.  The couple, through the The Clooney Foundation for Justice, have made a $1 million donation to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that will fund a joint initiative to combat hate groups.  The move comes more than a week after an August 12 ""Unite the Right"" rally sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead and 19 injured. Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.  ""What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate,"" they said.  In the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.  ""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Trump said during a news conference August 15.  George Clooney appeared to reference the President's comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.  ""Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality. There are no two sides to bigotry and hate,"" he said.  The Clooney Foundation for Justice was formed in 2016 to ""advance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities around the world,"" according to a mission statement on its website.  George and Amal Clooney, who recently welcomed twins, serve as the foundation's presidents.  ""Like George and Amal Clooney, we were shocked by the size, ugliness, and ferocity of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville,"" said SPLC President Richard Cohen in a statement. ""It was a reflection of just how much Trump's incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right. We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country's fight against hate.""  The SPLC said it tracks more than 1,600 extremist groups operating in the U.S.  Further details about the joint initiative are expected to be announced at a later date, the organization said."	0

"New York (CNN) In death, as in life, Anthony Bourdain brought us closer together.  On his award-winning series, ""Parts Unknown,"" Bourdain brought the world home to CNN viewers. Through the simple act of sharing meals, he showcased both the extraordinary diversity of cultures and cuisines, yet how much we all have in common.  Tragically, he proved this again on Friday. Bourdain's death shook television viewers around the world . The most common sentiment: ""I feel like I've lost a friend.""  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.  There is also a crisis text line . For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454.  The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK.  Bourdain was a larger-than-life figure -- a gifted chef and storyteller who used his books and shows to explore culture, cuisine and the human condition.  ""Tony was a symphony,"" his friend and fellow chef Andrew Zimmern said Friday.  The news of Bourdain's death was met by profound sadness within CNN, where ""Parts Unknown"" has aired for the past five years. In an email to employees, the network's president, Jeff Zucker, remembered him as an ""exceptional talent.""  ""Tony will be greatly missed not only for his work but also for the passion with which he did it,"" Zucker wrote.  CNN said Bourdain was in France working on an upcoming episode of his award-winning CNN series, ""Parts Unknown."" His close friend Eric Ripert, the French chef, found Bourdain unresponsive in his hotel room Friday morning. He was 61 and took his own life.  ""Anthony was my best friend,"" Ripert tweeted. ""An exceptional human being, so inspiring & generous. One of the great storytellers who connected w so many. I pray he is at peace from the bottom of my heart. My love and prayers are also w his family, friends and loved ones.""  Anthony was my best friend. An exceptional human being, so inspiring & generous.

My love & prayers are also w his family, friends and loved ones. pic.twitter.com/LbIeZK14ia — Eric Ripert (@ericripert) June 8, 2018  Viewers felt connected to Bourdain through his fearless travels, his restless spirit and his magical way with words.  ""His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much,"" CNN said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.""  CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, called Bourdain a ""giant talent.""  ""My heart breaks for Tony Bourdain,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""May he rest in peace now.""  My heart breaks for Tony Bourdain. May he rest in peace now. He was a friend, a collaborator, and family. A huge personality, a giant talent, a unique voice, and deeply, deeply human. My heart goes out to his daughter and family, and his longtime partners and friends at ZPZ. — Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) June 8, 2018  President Donald Trump extended his condolences to Bourdain's family on Friday morning. ""I enjoyed his show,"" Trump said. ""He was quite a character.""  Former President Barack Obama recalled a mea l he shared with Bourdain in Vietnam while Obama was on a trip through Asia in 2016 -- an encounter captured in a ""Parts Unknown"" episode that year.  ""'Low plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.' This is how I'll remember Tony,"" Obama posted to Twitter on Friday. ""He taught us about food -- but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We'll miss him.""  ""Low plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer."" This is how I'll remember Tony. He taught us about food — but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We'll miss him. pic.twitter.com/orEXIaEMZM — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 8, 2018  For the past year, Bourdain had been dating Italian actress Asia Argento. She remembered Bourdain as someone who ""gave all of himself in everything that he did.""  Last year, he advocated for Argento as she went public with accusations against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. ""He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated.""

Hide Caption 22 of 22  Bourdain's death came days after fashion designer Kate Spade died in a suicide at her Manhattan apartment.  Suicide is a growing problem in the United States. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a survey Thursday showing suicide rates increased by 25% across the country over nearly two decades ending in 2016. Twenty-five states experienced a rise in suicides by more than 30%, the government report finds.  'The Elvis of bad boy chefs'  Bourdain was a master of his crafts -- first in the kitchen and then in the media. Through his TV shows and books , he helped audiences think differently about food, travel and themselves. He advocated for marginalized populations and campaigned for safer working conditions for restaurant staffs.  Along the way, he received practically every award the industry has to offer.  In 2013, Peabody Award judges honored Bourdain and ""Parts Unknown"" for ""expanding our palates and horizons in equal measure.""  ""He's irreverent, honest, curious, never condescending, never obsequious,"" the judges said. ""People open up to him and, in doing so, often reveal more about their hometowns or homelands than a traditional reporter could hope to document.""  The Smithsonian once called him ""the original rock star"" of the culinary world, ""the Elvis of bad boy chefs."" His shows took him to more than 100 countries and three networks.  While accepting the Peabody award in 2013, Bourdain described how he approached his work.  ""We ask very simple questions: What makes you happy? What do you eat? What do you like to cook? And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions,"" he said. ""We tend to get some really astonishing answers.""  Friends and acquaintances remembered Bourdain's curiosity for the world's variety of cultures and cuisine rubbing off on them.  His good friend Michael Ruhlman said he was stunned by news of the suicide.  ""The last I knew, he was in love. He was happy,"" Ruhlman told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""He said, 'Love abounds' -- some of the last words he said to me.""  Ruhlman said Bourdain was much more sensitive than people realized, but that sensitivity coupled with Bourdain's bravado made him a great storyteller.  Ruhlman and chef James Syhabout both said that when people found out they knew Bourdain, they would ask what he really was like.  Exactly like he was on camera, they said.  ""And that's the beauty of him,"" Syhabout told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""He's unapologetically honest. ... It all gives us courage to be ourselves and be individuals and that's what really radiates from him.""  Chef and writer Edward Lee, who hosted a season of a show produced by Bourdain, looked back at their time working together and wrote that ""Tony gave us a world that we didn't know we needed.""  Others who fondly recalled their interactions with Bourdain included chef Gordon Ramsay, who said Bourdain ""brought the world into our homes and inspired so many people to explore cultures and cities through their food.""  From 'happy dishwasher' to addiction to fame  Bourdain grew up in Leonia, New Jersey, and started working in kitchens in his teens -- including on Massachusetts' Cape Cod during the summer.  ""I was a happy dishwasher,"" he said in a 2016 interview on NPR's ""Fresh Air."" ""I jokingly say that I learned every important lesson, all the most important lessons of my life, as a dishwasher.""  It was during those early jobs, he said, that he began using drugs, eventually developing a heroin addiction and other problems that he later said should have killed him in his 20s. He often talked of his addiction later in life.  ""Somebody who wakes up in the morning and their first order of business is (to) get heroin -- I know what that's like,"" Bourdain said in a 2014 ""Parts Unknown"" episode highlighting an opioid crisis in Massachusetts.  After spending two years at New York's Vassar College, he dropped out and enrolled in culinary school. He spent years as a line cook and sous chef at restaurants in the Northeast before becoming executive chef at Manhattan's Brasserie Les Halles.  A different passion -- his writing -- helped put him on the map by his early 40s.  ""In America, the professional kitchen is the last refuge of the misfit. It's a place for people with bad pasts to find a new family,"" he wrote.  JUST WATCHED Anthony Bourdain on pushing boundaries Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Anthony Bourdain on pushing boundaries 00:36  The article morphed into a best-selling book in 2000, ""Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,"" which was translated into more than two dozen languages.  ""When the book came out, it very quickly transformed my life -- I mean, changed everything,"" he told NPR.  Bourdain found himself on a path to international stardom. First, he hosted ""A Cook's Tour"" on the Food Network, then moved to the Travel Channel with ""Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations,"" a breakout hit that earned two Emmy Awards and more than a dozen nominations.  In 2013, both Bourdain and CNN took a risk by bringing him to a network still best known for breaking news and headlines. Bourdain quickly became one of its principal faces and a linchpin of its prime-time schedule.  Season 11 of ""Parts Unknown"" premiered last month on CNN, with destinations including Uruguay, Armenia and West Virginia. The series has been honored with five Emmys.

MUST WATCH The 'insanely good' food of Hong Kong 01:09  In his final weeks, Bourdain said he was especially looking forward to an episode about Hong Kong, which aired Sunday.  He called it a ""dream show"" in which he linked up with longtime Hong Kong resident and cinematographer Christopher Doyle.  ""The idea was just to interview him and maybe get him to hold a camera. He ended up being director of photography for the entire episode,"" Bourdain told CNN in April. ""For me it was like asking Joe DiMaggio to, you know, sign my baseball and instead he joined my Little League team for the whole season.""  The show's website on Friday posted an homage to Bourdain featuring one of his many oft-repeated quotations -- one that seemed to embody his philosophy: ""If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. Walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food.""  --"	0
"Serena Williams has the cutest baby girl, and she knows it too. Maybe that’s why they’re always twinning in adorable matching outfits. In addition to being the G.O.A.T. in tennis, Williams is a happily married mom. We get to see that on her social media, and it’s so sweet.  She’s also a successful business mogul. (Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies.  Basically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn’t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she’s sharing her joy, and that’s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she’s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it’s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend. Williams shared their ensembles via her Instagram Story on Saturday, even detailing their accessories. (Because c’mon, no look is complete without the right accessories.)  Just look at this gorgeous mother-daughter duo!  Serena Williams / Instagram  Here’s how Serena Williams described their coordinating looks:  ""Olympia is wearing a beautiful tulle dress with gold, and it's white, and that's why I decided to wear white,"" Williams said.

CLOSE These are the women that will represent the U.S. in Pyeongchang, South Korea in February. USA TODAY Sports  Mirai Nagasu, Bradie Tennell and Karen Chen will make up the Olympic team. (Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports)  SAN JOSE, Calif. – There will be no surprises this year. The U.S. women’s Olympic figure skating team is set: Bradie Tennell, Mirai Nagasu and Karen Chen.  Unlike four years ago, when U.S. Figure Skating’s international committee chose to replace Nagasu with Ashley Wagner, the committee went by the order of the national championships, picking the first three finishers in the women’s competition at the 2018 nationals.  This means that the women’s team in Pyeongchang next month will be entirely different from the team that competed in Sochi four years ago: Wagner, Gracie Gold and Polina Edmunds. For most of the four years leading up to 2018, either Wagner or Gold, or both, were at the top of the sport domestically.  MORE: Wagner 'furious' at scoring  Each of the three women to make the team is something of a surprise. Tennell, 19, rose to prominence as recently as Thanksgiving weekend when she finished a surprising third at Skate America. That was the same competition Wagner, who finished fourth here, suddenly withdrew with an ankle infection.  Nagasu, 24, had an uneven fall season, but her attempts to land the difficult triple axel renewed her career. She won her only national title 10 years ago, in 2008. She finished fourth at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver.  Chen, 18, also overcame a disappointing fall season. She won the 2017 national title and finished fourth at the worlds in Helsinki, helping to secure three spots for the U.S. women at the 2018 Olympics.  Wagner, 26, the only U.S. woman to win a world championship medal in the past 11 seasons (silver in 2016), was named the first alternate.  PHOTOS: Best of the 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championship	0

"Washington (CNN) It wouldn't be an awards show without some political moments.  This year, we kept track of every political jab and line made at the 90th annual Academy Awards show . Check out the list below:  On the carpet  Fashion as a political statement  Tonight, actors and allies will #WearOrange pins and ribbons on the #Oscars red carpet to bring awareness to gun violence prevention in the wake of the Parkland school shooting. https://t.co/7BxtM6bTKD  As expected, many attendees sported the signature ""Time's up"" black and white pin.  Another popular pin spotted on the carpet? #WearOrange pins and ribbons from gun control group Everytown. They were worn in an effort to raise awareness about gun safety.  Puerto Rico still on the mind  During an interview with Michael Strahan, ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda encouraged viewers to visit Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane.  Lin-Manuel Miranda encourages viewers to visit Puerto Rico after devastating hurricane: ""Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation...keep Puerto Rico in your hearts."" https://t.co/exBwXimwm1 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/kBxhqLo1UG — ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018  ""Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation. I know there's no shortage of things in the news, but keep Puerto Rico in your hearts,"" Miranda said.  He added that tourism is ""the lifeblood"" of Puerto Rico, and urged people to ""spend money there.""  On average, 87% of the island has power, but sources told CNN that about 150,000 US citizens on the island still don't have electricity. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has repeatedly expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery and help. He has questioned the US Army Corps of Engineers' response on the island compared with other states dealing with disaster.  Miranda has been an outspoken critic of the government response to Puerto Rico's needs, and had strong words for President Donald Trump following his criticism of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz last year.  In October of 2017, Miranda released a song -- with help from 22 other artists -- to raise money for hurricane relief in Puerto Rico.  Political activists attended Hollywood's biggest night  Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards attended the Oscars with Patrisse Cullors-Brignac, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, and Bryan Stevenson, Equal Justice Initiative director. The three posed on the red carpet ahead of the show.  Richards, who announced in January that she is leaving the role later this year, posted a photo on Instagram. ""So the Oscars are cool but being with Bryan and Patrisse is 100,"" she wrote.  Jimmy Kimmel's opener  Kimmel returned to the helm as host on Sunday. He of course had a few envelope jokes, referencing the envelope mix-up last year that initially (and mistakenly) resulted in ""La La Land"" being named the best picture winner over ""Moonlight"" at the 89th Academy Awards.  But there were also a few political zingers.  Wakanda  Before kicking off his monologue, Kimmel did an old Hollywood-like voiceover to black and white footage from this year's red carpet.  ""There's Chadwick Boseman,"" he said at one point, as footage of the ""Black Panther"" actor played. ""The king of Wakanda! Imagine that! A country with a black leader. Wouldn't that be swell?""  Fox News  Later, while talking about Harvey Weinstein -- and the subsequent powerful #MeToo movement and Time's Up initiative -- Kimmel joked about the awards show statuette: Oscar.  ""Oscar is 89 years old this year, which probably means he's at home watching Fox News,"" Kimmel said, a jab at the network news channel's older, more conservative viewers.  He went on to clarify that ""Oscar is a very respected man in Hollywood. Just look at him: He keeps his hands where he can see them, no penis.""  ""Get Out"" and Trump  The first Trump joke came about 10 minutes into Kimmel's monologue.  ""None other than President Trump called 'Get Out' the best 3/4 of a movie so far this year,"" Kimmel said when addressing the mastermind behind the film, Jordan Peele  The horror film, which has received praise for its performances and thought-provoking take on race in America, received four Academy Award nominations, including one for best picture.  Calling out Vice President Mike Pence  Kimmel made a joke about Pence while talking about best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet, nominated for the film ""Call Me By Your Name,"" a gay love story.  ""We don't make films like 'Call Me By Your Name for money,"" Kimmel said, while talking about how the film was critically acclaimed but didn't do as well at the box office. ""We make them to upset Mike Pence.""  Kimmel during the show  Hope Hicks' departure  Kimmel made another White House joke while introducing director Greta Gerwig and actress Laura Dern before they presented the best documentary feature category.  ""If the last two years have taught us anything, it's that reality can be ... depressing,"" he said. ""But tonight's nominated documentaries show us that where there is darkness, there is also hope. Except at the White House. Hope quit on Wednesday.""  Hicks, the former White House communications director and one of Trump's longest-serving and closest aides, resigned last week.  Putin burn  The Russian Olympics doping documentary ""Icarus"" took home best documentary feature on Sunday.  The film, from filmmaker Bryan Fogel, delves into the controversy around performance-enhancing drugs in sports. It follows the eccentric Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the whistleblower who exposed what a leading report called a doping ""cover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale"" in Russia (read CNN's story on this here ).  Russia was banned from the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics following state-sponsored doping, leading up to and including the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.  Kimmel's response to ""Icarus"" winning? ""At least we know Putin didn't rig this competition.""  Speaking of 'Icarus' ...  During his acceptance speech, Fogel got a little political himself.  ""We dedicate this award to Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, our fearless whistleblower, who now lives in great danger,"" he said. ""We hope 'Icarus' is a wake-up call -- yes, about Russia, but more importantly, about telling the truth.""

Join us as we say #HereWeArehttps://t.co/bVXGJ1NibP — Twitter (@Twitter) March 5, 2018  Twitter premiered an ad called #HereWeAre during the Oscars with a message empowering women leaders. While the ad was not explicitly political, it included an implicit reference to immigration rhetoric.  ""If this poem is the only thing that survives me, tell them this is how it happened: Tell them I built me a throne. Tell them when we discovered life on another planet it was a woman and she built a bridge -- not a border. I heard that this is how you make history. This is how you create a new world.""  A shout out to the Dreamers  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has enabled hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants -- sometimes called Dreamers -- who were brought to the United States as children to come out from the shadows and openly attend school and get work permits and driver's licenses without fear of being deported.  Trump announced the end of the DACA program last fall, giving Congress a March 5 deadline to come up with an alternate solution. But that deadline became moot after two separate district courts ruled that the administration must keep accepting renewal applications for the program, effectively putting the termination on hold.  ""Like everyone in this room and everyone watching at home we are dreamers,"" said Nyong'o, who is from Kenya. ""We grew up dreaming of one day working in the movies. Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood, and dreams are the foundation of America.""  Nanjiani added: ""To all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you.""  Common, Andra Day and activists share stage  Richards, of Planned Parenthood  Cullors, of Black Lives Matter  Alice Brown Otter, of Standing Rock Youth Council  Bana Alabed, author and Syrian refugee  Stevenson, of Equal Justice Initiative  Dolores Huerta, of Dolores Huerta Foundation and United Farm Workers of America  Janet Mock, of #GirlsLikeUs  José Andrés, of ThinkFoodGroup  Nicole Hockley, of Sandy Hook Promise  Tarana Burke, of #MeToo  Common called out the National Rifle Association during his rap.  ""Tell the NRA they ain't God's way and tell the people of Parkland we say àse (a West African philosophy about creating change).,"" the Oscar-winning rapper said, referring to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead last month.  The NRA responded to Common on Twitter. The organization wrote : ""@common @TheAcademy: This is what the #NRA and its members stand for. #Oscars."" The tweet included a video of Dom Raso, a Navy SEAL veteran.  #TimesUp in the spotlight  Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek praise the #MeToo, #TimesUp movements: ""The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, of different voices, of our voices."" https://t.co/wst3Hx4GJF #Oscars pic.twitter.com/dBqhimu402 — ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018  Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek -- three of Harvey Weinstein's accusers -- also shared an emotional moment onstage, before introducing a video that featured many of the Oscar nominees and others in the industry talking about the importance of diversity in Hollywood.  ""The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, different voices, of our voices, who are joining together in a mighty chorus that is finally saying Time's Up,"" Judd said.  The video featured interviews with Nanjiani, Ava Duvernay, Greta Gerwig, Barry Jenkins and others.  ""Some of my favorite movies are by straight white dudes, about straight white dudes,"" Nanjiani says in the video. ""Now you can watch my movies and relate to me. It's not that hard. I've been doing it my whole life.""  Guillermo del Toro 'erases lines in the sand'  Mexican filmmaker del Toro won best director on Sunday for ""The Shape of Water,"" making him the third director from Mexico to win the category. Alfonso Cuarón won for ""Gravity"" in 2014 and Alejandro González Iñárritu won for ""Birdman"" in 2015 and ""The Revenant"" in 2016.  ""I am an immigrant,"" del Toro said in his speech. ""In the last 25 years, I've been living in a country all of our own. The greatest thing our industry does is to erase lines in the sand. We should continue to do that.""  ""The Shape of Water"" also won the biggest award of the night -- best picture -- to bring its total statuettes to four."	1
"The fate of the upcoming Han Solo spin-off film is currently unknown, as a surprise announcement came late on Tuesday that revealed directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were leaving the film with three weeks left of filming. Although their successor has yet to be named, Star Wars fanboy and filmmaker Kyle Newman threw his hat into the ring and even offered to take a massive pay cut to bring the film to completion.  When people began suggesting he take over the reins on Twitter, Newman replied with a string of replies to various different accounts. His message on the matter is as follows:  ""I'm available. To be honest, I'd kill it. Was born for it. And know Solo inside out. And am free. As in I would cost zero dollars. I'm not shiny and new. But goddamn could I direct the f**k out of some Star Wars. I have my doctorate in it after all. No fear. Only adrenaline. If it's Star Wars, then I'm your guy. Period. I know Solo inside and out. You'd enjoy my Han Solo radio dramas recorded live at the past three domestic SW Celebrations. I truly feel like I'm wasting my life NOT working on Star Wars in some capacity. I would go supernova and blow people's minds."" The filmmaker then noted, ""It could be a great film and will be a great film."" He also made sure to commend Lord and Miller, saying, ""Those guys are great and their DNA will still be all over it.""  UP NEXT: More Possible Han Solo Replacement Directors Named Not wanting to hog all the attention himself, Newman also suggested that Dave Filoni, director of the Clone Wars animated series and executive producer of Star Wars Rebels, could finish the production.  A huge force in the fan community, Newman has made multiple projects that honor the saga, from the Fanboys film starring Kristen Bell and Dan Fogler about fans trying to break into Lucasfilm to see Phantom Menace before it was released to a variety of live stage shows at conventions and documentaries. MORE NEWS: Han Solo Directors Reportedly Fired After Clashing With Kathleen Kennedy ""Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are talented filmmakers who have assembled an incredible cast and crew, but it’s become clear that we had different creative visions on this film, and we’ve decided to part ways. A new director will be announced soon,"" Kathleen Kennedy said in a statement.  Lord and Miller also released a statement, saying, ""Unfortunately, our vision and process weren’t aligned with our partners on this project. We normally aren’t fans of the phrase ‘creative differences’ but for once this cliché is true. We are really proud of the amazing and world-class work of our cast and crew."" The untitled Han Solo movie will be in theaters May 25, 2018.  Alden Ehrenreich stars as a young Han Solo and Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca in the era before Star Wars: A New Hope, before they met Leia and Luke and embarked on a galaxy-saving adventure. Donald Glover also stars as Lando Calrissian, with Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Emilia Clarke in as-yet-unrevealed co-starring roles."	0
"Cam Newton’s sexist comment to a female reporter has cost the Carolina Panthers quarterback a side gig as a yogurt pitchman amid national backlash.  Dannon, the maker of Oikos yogurt, has dropped Newton from all advertising campaigns following what the company perceives as “sexist” remarks he made on Wednesday to Jourdan Rodrigue, a beat reporter with the Charlotte Observer.  Cam Newton disses female reporter with sexist remark at press conference Read more  Company spokesperson Michael Neuwirth released a statement Thursday saying it was “shocked and disheartened” at the former league MVP’s behavior.  Newton made light of a straightforward question from Rodrigue during his regular media availability on Wednesday, saying it was “funny to hear a female” ask about football.  The 28-year-old quarterback, who smirked derisively as the reporter asked about Carolina wide receiver Devin Funchess’s route-running, prefaced his response with a dig: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes. It’s funny.”  The Dannon statement noted the company perceives Newton’s comments as “sexist and disparaging to all women. It’s simply not OK to belittle anyone based on gender. We have shared our concerns with Cam and will no longer work with him.”  Carlin & Reese (@CarlinReeseWIP) Here's the video of Cam Newton saying ""it's funny to hear a female talk about routes"" pic.twitter.com/hd9Kg4CCeu  The company later clarified: “The agreement has not been terminated. However, we will no longer work with him and are removing advertising with him in it.”  Later Thursday, Newton apologized in a video posted to Twitter for what he described as an “extremely degrading and disrespectful” choice of words.  “After careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,” he said. “And to be honest, that was not my intention. If you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.  “I’m a man who tries to be a positive role model to my community and tries to use my platform to inspire others. I take ownership to everything that comes with that. What I did was extremely unacceptable.”  Dannon inked Newton to sponsor its Oikos brand of Greek yogurt in January 2015, shortly after the quarterback’s maiden playoff victory.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Newton has sponsored Dannon’s Oikos yogurt since 2015.  By the end of that year, one that saw the quarterback capture MVP honors while leading the Panthers to Super Bowl 50, Newton had become one of the NFL’s most visible pitchmen with an endorsement portfolio including pacts with Gatorade, Under Armour, Beats By Dre, Nickelodeon, Carolina Health Systems and Belk worth an estimated $11m combined.  Gatorade also issued a statement Thursday, saying: “Cam’s comments were objectionable and disrespectful to all women and they do not reflect the values of our brand. Gatorade fully supports women who compete in, report on, coach for, or play any role in sport – on or off the field.”  The NFL added in another statement that Newton’s response to the question was “just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league.”  Cam Newton's joyful Panthers remind us that football can still be fun Read more  But it doesn’t appear there will be any punishment handed out to Newton.  “I think there are conversations going on at the club level with the appropriate people, with the Panthers,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a conference call Thursday. “I don’t want to anticipate the league stepping in there.”  Mike Persinger, the executive sports editor of the Observer, said Wednesday evening that Newton’s comments were “unfortunate and out of line.”  The Associated Press Sports Editors announced that it “agrees wholeheartedly that Mr Newton’s response was out of line” and “we ask for a formal apology to Jourdan Rodrigue from Mr Newton and the Carolina Panthers organization.”    The Newton hubbub inadvertently prompted a separate controversy after three tweets Rodrigue posted years ago with racial overtones were discovered by Black Sports Online. The reporter used the word “nigga” in one of the tweets and referenced laughing at racist jokes in the others.  “I apologize for the offensive tweets from my Twitter account from 4/5 years ago,” Rodrigue said on Thursday. “There is no excuse for these tweets and the sentiment behind them. I am deeply sorry and apologize.”    Newton, who slumped badly last season after his spectacular MVP campaign in 2015, has passed for 882 yards with five touchdowns and five interceptions in four games this year, leading the Panthers to a 3-1 record and a tie for first place in the NFC South."	0

Olympic gymnast Simone Biles is used to flipping and twisting her way to victory on the mats - but now the gold medal winner has fallen head over heels for another reason entirely.  The 20-year-old has confirmed a romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin, taking to Instagram on Monday to post a sweet tribute to her new boyfriend.  Alongside an image of the couple sharing a tender embrace, Simone, who trains at the same gym as Stacey in Texas, posted the caption: 'Always smiling with you.'  Head over heels! Simon Biles has confirmed her romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin  Awwww! 'Always smiling with you,' the 20-year-old Olympian captioned a photo of the cute couple staring at each other on a balcony  And it seems Simone is not the only one ready to shout about the romance from the rooftops.  Ervin let slip the secret about their relationship a day before on his own account, after accompanying Simone to her induction into the Gymnastics Hall Of Fame.  'Words cannot express how incredibly proud I am of you, all you've accomplished and how well you carry yourself,' he wrote alongside a picture of the couple at the ceremony, smiling with their arms around each other.  'You make me feel like I am the luckiest man alive. Congratulations on your induction to the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame!'  He added: 'I can't wait to see what the future has in store.'  It is not the first time that Simone has featured on her boyfriend's account, however, and vice versa.  Earlier this month, Simone and Ervin posted pictures of themselves posing with a group of friends at a Bryson Tiller concert in Houston, Texas, with neither choosing to tag their significant other in the post, no doubt keen to keep their relationship under wraps for a little longer.  Young love: Earlier this month, both Simone and her Stacey (center) posted images of themselves at a Bryson Tiller concert with a group of friends  Secret: Neither Simone or Stacey chose to tag their significant other in the image, which were taken in Houston, Texas, no doubt keen to maintain some privacy around their relationship  Five-time Olympic medalist Simone opened up about her love life in an interview with ET earlier this year, admitting she had 'never had a boyfriend in [her] life'.  'At 20 years old I feel like you should have gone through those things and gone on dates,' she said. 'I have been on like, maybe one proper date.'  Simone, who earned four gold medals and one bronze at the Rio Olympics last summer, previously did not have much time to devote to dating due to her rigorous training schedule, which keeps her busy six days a week.  But her budding romance wasn't the only exciting element of the weekend for Simone, who was reunited with her fellow Final Five members of the 2016 Olympics team, both at the Hall of Fame ceremony and the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California.  Simone shared some pics with her former team members at the induction, posing alongside Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez and Aly Raisman.  Olympians: Simone also shared some pics with her fellow Final Five members at the induction, Aly Raisman (left), Laurie Hernandez (center left), and Madison Kocian (center right)  Flying high: Simone let slip over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, suggesting that she may have her sights set on a spot in the 2020 Olympic team  Winner: Stacey attended the University of Michigan, where he competed as a member of the men's artistic gymnastics team  The fifth member of the team, Gabby Douglas, did not attend the ceremony, having already been inducted into the Hall of Fame after competing in the 2012 Olympics, where she won the all-around gold medal which Simone clinched four years later.  However Gabby and the rest of the Final Five were reunited at the national gymnastics championships over the weekend, where they supported and cheered on the next generation of gymnasts.  Having taken a break from gymnastics for the past year - during which time she competed on Dancing With the Stars - Simone revealed over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, sparking speculation that she is training for a spot on the 2020 Olympic team.  Competition will be even fiercer for the next wave of Olympic hopefuls however; it was revealed during the 2016 Games that the team numbers would be reduced from five to four, meaning there is one less spot available on the squad.  Simone, who is arguably the most successful individual US female gymnast in the program's history, will no doubt be hoping to repeat the success of her teammates Gabby and Aly, who successful returned to their second Olympics in 2016, having already won gold in London in 2012.	0
She usually keeps mum about her private life, but Nelly Furtado revealed in a new interview on Wednesday that she’s back on the market.  “I am single now,” she said on ITV’s Loose Women about secretly splitting from Demacio Castellon last summer. “Someone here needs to update my Wikipedia. It’s not helping my dating life!”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The singer, 38, wed the sound engineer in 2008 in an ultra-private ceremony that they kept hidden from the public until more than a year later.  “I went through an emotionally difficult time last summer and I actually wrote and sung myself songs to get through it,” Furtado, who’s currently promoting her sixth studio album, The Ride, said about the breakup. “I would sing to myself while I drove on these long drives, and I thought to myself, ‘I’m so lucky that I can write songs because I can soothe myself with them.'”  And though she’s still working through her heartbreak, the star says she’s focusing on her 13-year-old daughter, Nevis (with ex Jasper Gahunia).  “Sometimes you just want to sit home and bake some muffins for your daughter. I need to stay mentally and emotionally and physically well for my daughter,” she said.  In 2014, Furtado opened up about collaborating with Castellon on both her 2006 album, Loose, and her Spanish-language album, Mi Plan, which went platinum and won a Latin Grammy for best female pop vocal.  “It’s a healthy tension working together,” she told PEOPLE. “It doesn’t always go smoothly, of course, and it can be really challenging when there are differences of opinion, which of course happens.”  “We’re very blessed to have a beautiful family. We have a great life together. Life is good,” she added.	0
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.  FILE PHOTO: Show host Ryan Seacrest addresses the audience during the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  Within the United States, the “American Idol” phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” CBS’s “Rock Star”, and Fox’s “The X Factor.”  Pop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.  “I’m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!” wrote Perry. “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”	0
By Zach Johnson  Original Source: eonline.com  Ethan Embry revealed that he was once addicted to black tar heroin and prescription painkillers. Though he’s now sober—and he’s never relapsed—the memories are still fresh in his mind. The 38-year-old actor, best known for his role in the teen comedy Can’t Hardly Wait, revealed the details of his private battle with opiate addiction in a series of tweets. Embry’s revelation came in response to Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordering federal prosecutors to seek the harshest possible criminal penalties for drug offenders.  “Opiate OD is the leading cause of preventable death in America at 50k last year alone. It’s a health [crisis]not a criminal one Mr Sessions,” Embry wrote. “For decades we have told addicts that their behavior deserves punishment. That they should be locked away for their addictions.

There’s a sad reason why there’s no one special in Justin Bieber‘s life at the moment.  The singer opened up about it during an interview on Monday with Australian radio hosts Kyle and Jackie O.  “I haven’t been in a relationship for a while now,” the 21-year-old said after the hosts asked him who he’d be bringing with him to Australia when he performs there later this month.  When Kyle questioned why a young pop star would want to be seriously involved with anyone anyway, Bieber clarified, “I’m a relationship type of guy. I love to be in love, love cuddling. I love all that stuff.”  Exclusive Details on Justin Bieber’s New Single ‘What Do You Mean’  He added, “I got my heart broken. I’m just trying to let that heal up.”  That prompted Jackie O. to ask about his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. The radio host asked about Gomez’s name being scrawled on a wall in his new “What Do You Mean?” video, and he dismissed it, saying, “I think that might be fake,” before going on to say “it wasn’t me that did that.”	1
“I love romantic comedies. I feel almost sheepish writing that, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years or so that admitting that you like these movies is a form of mild stupidity… I enjoy watching people fall in love on-screen so much that I can suspend my disbelief for the contrived situations that only happen in the heightened world of romantic comedies.” —Mindy Kaling, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?  At the end of its second season, The Mindy Project has become one of those shows that inspires strong reactions on either side, and very few in the middle. If you scout out Mindy Project reviews (wait, I’ve done it for you!), you’ll find both total pans (“The Mindy Project fails at everything it attempts”) and complete raves (“Why only an idiot would miss out on TV’s funniest comedy”). I fall closer to the latter on the scale, but I understand the former. I don’t really care if Mindy’s likable or not, as long as she’s entertaining, but some of her actions are insane (tracing her one-night stand to his workplace, a first-grade classroom) or ignorant (a medical doctor who doesn’t know what “condo” stands for?) enough to take the viewer out of the actual show to ponder, “Why am I watching this person?” When the show does stumble (“L.A.,” or the recent ill-scheduling of “Girl Crush”), it takes at least a week or so to right itself.  Advertisement  But when it realigns, The Mindy Project becomes one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV. Todd VanDerWerff points out that although the show seems to be in a constant state of transition, at least its trajectory is skewing upward, with a big leap forward between this season and last. I would probably watch it for the one-liners and absurdist asides (like the stalker raccoon) alone, but I also appreciate Mindy Kaling’s overall mission: To draft her own brand of romantic comedy. From the show’s first episodes, it established that Dr. Mindy Lahiri only wants to be Meg Ryan in a movie with Tom Hanks, as idealistic and unrealistic as that sounds. Her real-life counterpart has studied these rom-com tropes as well, so nods to the Nora Ephron canon (like “You’ve Got Sext”) abound in her scripts. She’s writing within the mold while redefining it: The saga of Mindy and Danny has contained some of the show’s finest work, as a hot in-air kiss led to a short yet delightful relationship, a too-quick and devastating breakup, and a hesitant walk toward each other again.  Heading into the finale, I fully expected Mindy and Danny to end up together (the episode title is a dead giveaway), but wondered how Kaling would make it memorable, meaningful, and most of all, funny. Fortunately, she pulled off this particular hat-trick. The episode features an absolute treasure trove of hilarious lines (I could list them all in stray observations, but that would be this entire review) strewn throughout the plot that finally brings Mindy and Danny together. This storyline not only utilizes the entire supporting cast for once (Zoe Jarman, we hardly knew ye), but it also uses Kaling’s rom-com curation as an actual plotting device. Pile on devastating performances by Kaling and Chris Messina, especially, and you have one of my favorite episodes of the year.  Danny pretending to be Mindy’s mysterious train admirer honors You’ve Got Mail, but also The Shop Around The Corner, the movie on which it was based. He knows her well enough to know that the promise of perfect romance will be enough to make her dump her real relationship with Detective Charlie. Danny suggests they meet on the top of the Empire State Building—add An Affair To Remember by way of Sleepless In Seattle—where he will reveal that he has loved her all along. After a slight derail, he visits her when she’s sick (You’ve Got Mail again), while offering to watch the ultimate film study in friendship-leading-to-romance: When Harry Met Sally (He: “I’ll order whatever gave her an orgasm!” She: “You paraphrased one of the most famous lines pretty well!”). Then, in a Danny voiceover, he takes her all over New York, “visiting any place that Meg Ryan ever laugh-cried.”  Advertisement  I cite Messina’s performance because although he tells Morgan and Tamra and Mindy his true feelings this episode, he has not voiced them since the breakup. But for the last four or five episodes, we still have known—by his frequent smoldering looks, attempts to work his way back into Mindy’s life, and just his ready acceptance to go get breakfast with her and be late for work.  When the entire office staff gets pulled in to lead Mindy and Danny back to each other, it works so well I wish they’d been used more throughout the entire season. Morgan has always been the office’s unsung MVP, as he figures out Danny’s secret plan (Danny asks, “How did you figure it out?”, then realizes he’s talking to Morgan: “How did you figure it out?”). Jeremy was awesome with his waivers, as was Peter with his final pep talk this season as he proves to Mindy that Danny still loves her.  So Mindy and Danny both race to the Empire State, and in one of my favorite bits of the episode, Danny gets hit by a car, yet still hobbles off. This is a hilarious nod to An Affair To Remember (which I will not spoil in case you haven’t seen it, but really, you should see it). Danny and Mindy reunite, and all is right with the sitcom world.  Advertisement  It’s such a perfect finale, I almost wish the show hadn’t been renewed. But then there would be no more Mindy Project, which would be a real disappointment. That’s the thing about rom-coms: The ending is always the same. But Mindy and Danny’s journey to get there was such an enjoyable trip. The challenge for season three will be to keep the momentum going into Danny and Mindy’s actual relationship, without contrived breakups or third-party romantic obstacles. This finale points to the possibility that The Mindy Project could pull it off.  Finale grade: A  Season grade: B  Stray observations:  On the train, Mindy’s coworkers are having a boring conversation about street mimes: “Mimes don’t even talk!”  For the record, Katie Holmes is six months older than Mindy Kaling.  I fervently hope Tim Daly is on the list for Emmy-nominated guest stars this year. Even his final scene is killer: He chastises Mindy for describing herself as a prostitute again (she shakes her head and agrees, “I know, I know”), then walks out of their breakup like a boss without ever acknowledging that he may have any flaws. I miss him already.  Loved Morgan’s dawning look of realization about Mindy’s “Mindy2ndaccount@hotmail” email address. And his sarcastic nods to Danny about honesty.  Also, Beverly covering her ears so she won’t have to hear Jeremy’s catfish story about the man with no torso again.  The title of Danny’s fake emails to Mindy: “what if… ,” “hello,” “today,” “coffee,” “good times.”  Morgan explains why Mindy should know Danny loves her: “He laughs at all of your jokes, and let’s face it, comedy is not your strong suit.”  The elevator guy sends Mindy up 104 floors seconds before the elevators start working again.  “You’re killing me, Bradley Cooper! What is this, a 20-piece suit?”  “Danny, who did I mail my underwear to?”  I starting reviewing The Mindy Project about midway through this season; I was not a huge fan of the show’s early episodes, but by the time Adam Pally showed up, it began to win me over. It was a lot of fun to write about; thanks for reading!	0

For a while now, Will and Jada have said that they don’t call themselves married anymore. Instead, they call themselves life partners. Personally, I wondered about that. What was that about? What’s the reason.  But in an interview with People, Jada explained.  “ I needed a different form to dissolve all the expectations that I had of a marriage. I needed to do that to see Will outside of husband and see him as a human being. We have all these expectations. ‘Oh, this is what a husband is. This is what a wife is.’ I started dissolving all the ideas and expectations and labels.”  Will will join Jada, her mother Adrienne Banefield-Jones and daughter Willow Smith on the season premiere of “Red Table Talk” on Facebook on October 22.  The two will discuss their evolving relationship there.  “Will comes on the show for two episodes, and we talk about redefining our relationship, going from calling ourselves married to becoming life partners. I felt like there was a way to speak about that that was open and transparent. But there are still aspects that are private!”  I know there are some who will read this description and write it off as additional evidence to prove Will and Jada have an open relationship or that they swing. But outside of the sexual component, I think we can all admit that there are expectations for married people—moreso for women than men. And if you walk into a relationship believing that you and that person should behave in rigid, pre-defined ways, it can present a problem when you want to do or behave differently.  It reminds me of the reason Oprah and Stedman have never married.  Last year, Oprah explained that there was a time when she wanted to marry Stedman and a time when he proposed to her. But a book proposal delayed their plans of getting married and eventually the two abandoned the discussion of marriage.  Oprah said, “We would not have stayed together because marriage requires a different way of being in this world. His interpretation of what it means to be a husband and what it would mean for me to be a wife would have been pretty traditional, and I would not have been able to fit into that.”  Shonda Rhimes shared a similar sentiment during her sit down with Winfrey for Super Soul Sunday, saying, “What I realized is, I don’t want to be married…because I could not have the life that I created for myself.”  Marriage requires compromise. And for women like Oprah and Shonda that might have meant compromising themselves. And that would have been a price to heavy to pay…not only for themselves but for the world.  Still, I think honest conversations about what each party expects in a marriage—before that marriage takes place, could lead to a partnership where both parties still feel free to do and achieve all that they were meant to in the world.  What do you think about the idea of not calling yourselves married?  Veronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.

"David Robert Joseph Beckham OBE[4] (; born 2 May 1975) is an English retired professional footballer. He played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team, for which he held the appearance record for an outfield player until 2016. He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.[5][6]  Known for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham was runner up in the Ballon d'Or, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[7][8][9] He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008. A global ambassador for the sport, Beckham is regarded as a British cultural icon.[10][11]  Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17.[12] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[12] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[13] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[14] In July 2007 Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[15] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[12]  In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[16][17] He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004.  Beckham has consistently ranked among the highest earners in football, and in 2013 was listed as the highest-paid player in the world, having earned over $50 million in the previous 12 months.[18] He has been married to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and they have four children.[19] He has been a UNICEF UK ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund.[20] In 2014, MLS announced that Beckham and a group of investors would own an expansion team in Miami, which will begin in 2020.[21]  Early life  Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.[22] He is the son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan ""Ted"" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 1969.[23] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School.[24] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, ""At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do.""[25] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[26] and Beckham has referred to himself as ""half Jewish""[27] and wrote in his autobiography ""I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion"".[28] In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.[29]  His parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who frequently travelled to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers , which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.[30] He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.[31]  Club career  Manchester United  Youth and early career  Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[32] Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.[32]  Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.[33]  Preston North End (loan)  Beckham then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994–95 season to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a corner kick.[34]  Return to Manchester United  Beckham returned to Manchester and made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn Rovers, missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which United lost 1–0, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.[35]  United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as ""Fergie's Fledglings""), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at Aston Villa,[36] with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.[37]  Beckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also providing the corner from which Eric Cantona scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.[38]  ""It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud nine. I just wanted to shake everybody's hand and be out on the pitch for an hour."" —Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name.[39]  At the beginning of the 1996–97 season, Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.[40]  When Beckham scored his famous goal, he was wearing Adidas Predator boots customised for Charlie Miller (""Charlie"" was embroidered on the boots) which had been given to Beckham by mistake.[41] In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[42] During the 1996–97 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping them to retain the Premier League championship, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers.[43] Manchester United started the 1997–98 season well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind Arsenal.[44]  In the 1998–99 season, he was part of the United team that won the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football.[45] There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.[46]  To ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.[45] Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.[45]  Beckham played in central midfield in United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the match.[45] United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.[45] Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[47]  Despite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,[48] but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.[49]  By the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis, but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been ""fair to his teammates""[50] Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.  ""He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.""' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.[51]  He was a key player in United's third successive league title in 2000–01, only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.  On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo de La Coruña, breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in that year's World Cup.[52] The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.[53] Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.  Following an injury early in the 2002–03 season, Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw[54][55][56][57][58] [59] or kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, causing a cut that required stitches. The incident led to a great deal of transfer speculation involving Beckham, with bookmakers offering odds on whether he or Ferguson would be first to leave the club.[60] Although the team had started the season badly, their results improved greatly from December onwards and they won the league, with Beckham managing a total of 11 goals in 52 games in all competitions. He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.[61]  Beckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined them at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes).  Real Madrid  ""He is a great player who is going to become part of the club's great history. He is a man of our times and a symbol of modern-day stardom and what is certain is Real Madrid have signed Beckham because he's a great footballer and a very dedicated professional. His team spirit is unsurpassed and he is one of the best English players of all-time and if only because of that he is with us."" —Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez during Beckham's unveiling.[62]  As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[63] and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[64] but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for €37 million on a four-year contract.[65] Beckham was the latest signing in the Galácticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez every summer.[66] The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.[67] Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.[68] Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain Raúl. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.[69]  Beckham (top) and Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid in August 2003  In the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues.[70]  Shortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe, who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment, which already managed the career of Victoria.[71] Beckham also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be his personal manager.[72][73]  In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca, with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Luís Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Raúl and Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation, with two fullbacks Míchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos, often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.[74]  Real Madrid were runners-up in the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.[75]  The league season began with new head coach José Antonio Camacho at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano García Remón took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution, and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had ""made a mistake"" and apologised.[76] He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.  By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, García Remón was dismissed, and Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by Juan Ramón López Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.  Beckham warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006  During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.[77] Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.  The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. Ramón Calderón became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier José Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatović announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.[78]  On 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the LA Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team.[79] A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said that Beckham is ""going to Hollywood to be half a film star"", adding ""our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles"".[80]  About a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory.[81] In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn describing his performance as ""world class"".[82]  Beckham during his last season with Real Madrid  On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's La Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in the club's history. Although Real and Barçelona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.[83] With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, watching from a luxury box at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.[83]  Towards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.[84] Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.[85]  A month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, Forbes magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600 million during Beckham's four years at the club.[86]  LA Galaxy  I'm coming there not to be a superstar. I'm coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win things. With me, it's about football. I'm coming there to make a difference. I'm coming there to play football ... I'm not saying me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. That would be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make a difference.[87] Beckham on going to America    Beckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.[88]  Beckham scores his first goal for LA Galaxy with a trademark free-kick.  The announcement made top news all across the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250 million,[89] the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).[90] To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5 million in total or $6.5 million per year.[72][91]  The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20 million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, the Home Depot Center).[92] Even the LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) saw an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: ""Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed"".[93]  In the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25 million whenever he stopped playing in the league[94] – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.[92] In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2 million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.[95]  Beckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team  Beckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the famous Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.[96] Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.[97]  In parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated, a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign ""Fútbol meets Football"" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400 million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.[98] That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special Victoria Beckham: Coming to America aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.[99]  Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007  On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer.[100] With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.[95] As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.[95]  The day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[101]  Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.[102]  Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008  Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.[103] Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.  Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.[104] He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August.  During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league). Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.[105] Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute.[106] On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70 yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[107] Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.  Milan (loan)  In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, Milan announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009.[108] Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March.[109] Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.[110]  Beckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club vice captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively. After his physical, Beckham was reportedly told by a club doctor that he believed he could continue playing football for another five years, up to the age of 38.[111] The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to San Siro where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming ""Forza Milan"" over the public address system.[112] Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5–1.[113]  ""On the pitch, Beckham sees everything before everyone else. His vision of play is better now than during his time in Manchester. He is slower but much stronger tactically and technically. He is very intelligent and works a lot."" —A.C. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti on Beckham's condition at 33 years old.[114]  Playing on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kaká in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89 minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico.[115] Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start.[116] Going into Beckham's home debut versus Fiorentina a week later, all the talk was around Kaká being the target of a reported £100 million transfer bid by Manchester City.[117] Beckham turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.[118]  A noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.[119] Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15 million range.[120]  Still, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.[121] On 2 March, the Los Angeles Times reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July.[122] This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique ""timeshare"" deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July till the end of the 2009 MLS season.[123]  Return to Galaxy  After his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying ""Go home fraud"", and ""Part-time player"".[124] The Galaxy, however, had a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 Western Conference final after a 2–0 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.[125] In the final on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.[126]  Return to Milan (loan)  In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.[127] On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75 minutes of a 5–2 victory over Genoa.[128] On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76 minutes of the match at the San Siro – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.[129]  Beckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.[130] Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.[131]  In Milan's next game, against Chievo, Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon,[132] causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the MLS season due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor Sakari Orava performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in Turku, Finland, on 15 March 2010.[133] After the operation, Orava affirmed that, ""it went quite fine. The prognosis is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking.""[134]  Second return to Galaxy  Beckham in 2010  On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over Columbus Crew.[135] On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over Chivas USA to mark his first goal in 2010.[136] On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2–1 win over FC Dallas which secured them their second successive Western Conference title and first MLS Supporters' Shield since 2002.[137]  During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.[138] As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.[139]  MLS Cup champion  Beckham with LA Galaxy in 2012  On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over Sporting Kansas City.[140] On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2–1 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for Preston North End.[141]  After having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player Robbie Keane.[139][142]  Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive Supporters' Shield, having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain, but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.[143][144][145][146] In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by President of the United States Barack Obama at the White House.[147]  Beckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders FC and then 3–1 over the Houston Dynamo to retain the MLS Cup.[148] He was subbed off in the 89th minute for Marcelo Sarvas and was given a standing ovation at their home venue.[149] Beckham had earlier announced that the 2012 MLS Cup Final would be his final game with the Galaxy despite having another year remaining on his contract.[150][151]  Paris Saint-Germain and retirement  On 31 January 2013, ahead of the transfer deadline it was announced that Beckham would be undergoing a medical with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a potential move to the Ligue 1 side.[152] Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club later that afternoon and confirmed that his entire salary during his time in Paris would be donated to a local children's charity.[153] His PSG debut came on 24 February 2013, when he came off the bench in the 76th minute in a Ligue 1 home match against Marseille. This made him the 400th player in the history of the club.[154] On 12 May 2013, Beckham won a fourth different top flight winners' medal after PSG beat Lyon 1–0 to claim the Ligue 1 title.[155]  On 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season.[156][157] Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012–13 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest.[158] In this game, Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans.[158] PSG went on to win the game 3–1.[158]  International career  Beckham as England captain  Beckham made his first appearance for the England national team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[159]  Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,[160] but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,[161] and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in a 2–0 victory, which was his first goal for England.[162]  In the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina.[163] Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor, striking him on the calf muscle.[163] Sports Illustrated was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics in that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a ""heavy-handed challenge"" on Beckham and then ""fell like a ton of bricks"" when Beckham retaliated.[164] Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send Beckham off.[165] The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.[166]  The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3–2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.[167] Beckham responded by raising his middle finger and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.[168]  On 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson.[169]  ""We've played two and a half minutes of stoppage time. England trail by 2 goals to 1. Beckham could raise the roof here with a goal ... I don't believe it! David Beckham scores the goal to take England all the way to the World Cup Finals! ... Give that man a Knighthood!"" —Television commentary on Beckham's stoppage time 30-yard curling free-kick against Greece in the 2002 World Cup qualifying game in October 2001.[170]  Beckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against Greece on 6 October 2001.[171] England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark.[171] Beckham was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001, and finished runner-up, to Luís Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[172]  Beckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against Sweden. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage.[173] England defeated Denmark in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3–0 win. England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil after Ronaldinho scored the winner.[174]  The following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004. He had a penalty saved in England's 2–1 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final match against Portugal.[175] England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition.[175]  Beckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.[176] In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.[169]  In England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2–0. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser.  During England's second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,[177] and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.[177] In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time.[178] After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.[179]  A day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,[169] stating, ""It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95[180] games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren."" (Beckham had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.[181]  Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was ""looking to go in a different direction"" with the team, and that Beckham ""wasn't included within that.""[182] McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role.  On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3–0. Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,[183] and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer.  On 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team.[184] On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2–2. Following the 2–3 loss, England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team.[185] After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.[186]  On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.[187] On 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.[188] In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.[189]  During the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3–1 in Minsk, Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain.[190] On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.[191] In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[192] His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended England 3 – 0 Belarus.[192]  After a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.[192] In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that ""I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think we need new players for the future"", referring to the new players that play in Beckham's right midfield position, including Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson, adding ""This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or another manager.""[192] He said that Beckham may be selected for one last friendly game, stating, ""If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye."" In response to the comments, Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed.[192] He remains 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, for a player of any position.[192]  Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics.[193] He was not included in the final selection by manager Stuart Pearce.[194]  Approach to training and discipline  Training and praise from managers  ""David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate."" —Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[195]  Beckham was a product of Sir Alex Ferguson's hard-working approach at Manchester United, and was renowned for his long-range passing, crossing ability, and bending free-kicks as a right winger. Ferguson noted that Beckham ""practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about.""[196][197][198] Beckham reportedly spent hours practising his free kicks after training sessions had ended.[195]  Beckham maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club.[199][200] Beckham's Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent he had ever seen.[201] Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, Roberto Carlos commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a free kick on the edge of the penalty area: ""I would stand on one side and Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because it's beautiful how he hits the ball.""[201]  In May 2013, asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, ""I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me.""[195]  Discipline  Beckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off.[202] Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.[163]  He amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in his time at Real Madrid; all four reds came in La Liga.[203] He received one red card while at Paris Saint-Germain, picked up in injury time in a match against Evian on 28 April 2013.[204] Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 420 competitive games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG, and received seven red cards, one every 60 matches on average.[203]  David Beckham Academy  Beckham Academy in London  In 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating from two sites, in London and Los Angeles. It was announced in late 2009 that both would close.[205] A mobile academy is being developed by Beckham, to travel around the UK and further afield.[206]  Major League Soccer team in Miami  On 5 February 2014, MLS announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion team for $25 million, which he had received as part of the contract he signed with the LA Galaxy in 2007.[94] The ownership group, led by Beckham, originally hoped the Miami-based team would begin play in 2016 or 2017.[21] After delays getting a stadium deal completed, MLS announced in January 2018 that the team had been approved and would likely begin play in 2020.[207]  Personal life  Beckham and his wife Victoria at the 2007 British Grand Prix at Silverstone  In 1997, Beckham started dating Victoria Adams, after she attended a Manchester United match. She was famously known as ""Posh Spice"" of the pop music group Spice Girls, one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed ""Posh and Becks"" by the media. He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in Cheshunt, England.  On 4 July 1999, they married at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. Beckham's teammate Gary Neville was the best man, and the couple's infant son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer. The media were kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with OK! Magazine, but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing them sitting on golden thrones.[208] 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost £500,000.[209]  David and Victoria Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999 at Portland Hospital, London),[210] Romeo James (born 1 September 2002 at Portland Hospital, London),[211] Cruz David (born 20 February 2005 at Ruber International Hospital, Madrid),[212] and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles).[213] Elton John is godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[214] Beckham's three sons have all played football in the Arsenal Academy.[215] Like their father, Brooklyn and Romeo have both done modelling work and been named among GQ's best dressed British men.[216] Brooklyn previously played football for Arsenal U16,[215] but was released at the end of the 2014–15 season.[217]  In his early Manchester United career, Beckham lived in a four-bedroom house in Worsley that he bought directly from the property developer as a 20-year-old in 1995.[218] In 1999, shortly after his wedding he and Victoria bought a country house set in 24 acres in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, which the media nicknamed ""Beckingham Palace"".[219]  Beckham suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him ""have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs."" Victoria Beckham claims, ""If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number.""[220]  In April 2004, the British tabloid News of the World carried claims by Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital affair.[221][222] A week later, the Malaysian-born Australian model Sarah Marbeck claimed that she had slept with Beckham on two occasions. Beckham dismissed both accusations as ""ludicrous"".[223]  In September 2010, Beckham announced that he was making a court application against prostitute Irma Nici and several others over claims in the magazine In Touch that he had sex with her.[224] Although the magazine later accepted that the allegations against Beckham were untrue, his court application was dismissed under US freedom of speech laws.[225][226]  Beckham's fame extends beyond the pitch; in much of the world his name is ""as instantly recognisable as that of multinational companies like Coca-Cola and IBM.""[227] Beckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football.  Beckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One example is a line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct.[228] In 2002, Beckham was hailed as the ultimate ""metrosexual"" by the man who invented the term[229] and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.[230]  The Beckhams were paid $13.7 million in 2007 to launch his fragrance line in the United States[231] In the world of fashion, David has already appeared on the covers of many magazines. United States covers have included the men's magazine Details, and with his wife for the August 2007 issue of W.[232] According to Google, ""David Beckham"" was searched for more than any other sports topic on their site in 2003 and 2004.[233][234] According to Ask Jeeves, Beckham ranked third, after Britney Spears and Osama bin Laden, among subjects most searched for by British users of that site in the first decade of the 2000s.[235]  Upon their arrival in Los Angeles on 12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters.[236] On the next night, Victoria appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to talk about their move to LA, and presented Leno with a number 23 Galaxy jersey with his own name on the back. Victoria also talked about her NBC TV show Victoria Beckham: Coming to America.[237] On 22 July, a private welcoming party was held for the couple at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. A-list celebrities attending included Steven Spielberg, Jim Carrey, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Oprah Winfrey.[238]  Beckham's many endorsement deals make him one of the most recognisable athletes throughout the world. Having worn Adidas football boots from the start of his career (notably Adidas Predator), in 2003 he signed a $160 million lifetime contract with Adidas, earning nearly half the money upfront, and will continue to earn percentages of profits on all of his branded Adidas products.[239] He had a 10-year collaboration with Pepsi Co. that expired in 2009.[240] He has also promoted The Walt Disney Company theme parks.[241]  Beckham with United States First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House, March 2012  Beckham has several eponymous video games, including Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure on Soccer Island, a platform game for the Game Boy Advance, and David Beckham Soccer, a football game for a number of platforms,[242][243] and he was brand ambassador for exercise video game EA Sports Active 2.[244] Beckham featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of FIFA 98.[245]  During his playing career (which ended in May 2013), Beckham generated an estimated £1 billion in shirt and boot sales.[246] In 2006, Lloyd's of London insured his legs for £100m, at the time he was playing for Real Madrid.[247][248] In March 2015 Beckham had the third highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, with over 52 million Facebook fans.[249]  At the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Beckham, Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis represented Britain during the handover segment for the 2012 Games to be held in London. Beckham rode a London double-decker bus into the stadium and Page and Lewis performed ""Whole Lotta Love"".[250] Beckham visited Afghanistan in May 2010 for a morale-boosting visit to British troops fighting the Taliban insurgency.[251][252] The appearance of Beckham as well as British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defence Secretary Liam Fox was believed to have prompted a Taliban attack on Kandahar airfield.[253][254]  Chinese authorities appointed Beckham as global ambassador for Chinese football in March 2013. After numerous officials had been banned for match-fixing, and the Chinese Super League had failed to retain the services of well-known international names, Beckham's role was to help improve the image of the game and raise its profile both in China and abroad.[255]  From 14 July 2013, Beckham started appearing in adverts for BSkyB advertising their Sky Sports coverage via the Sky Go app.[256] In January 2014, Beckham appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC in the U.S, and in March he made a guest appearance in the BBC's Sport Relief special of Only Fools and Horses.[257] He was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men in 2015.[216]  Beckham was announced as the new Ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council on 11 May 2018.[258] Prior to the June 2018 vote by FIFA member nations for selecting the hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Beckham endorsed the North American bid (Canada, Mexico and the United States).[259]  Charitable work  Beckham has supported UNICEF since his days at Manchester United and in January 2005, the English national team captain became a Goodwill Ambassador with a special focus on UNICEF's Sports for Development program.[20] In 2012, he met with UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to call for more action to help children affected by malnutrition around the world.[260] In 2015, his tenth year as a UNICEF Ambassador, Beckham launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund to help protect children in danger.[20] In June 2015 he visited Siem Reap in Cambodia, where he met with child victims of violence.[20] Beckham has pledged his support for the Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign. He is a former patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[261] In 2013, he also donated all his £3.4 million salary taken from Paris Saint-Germain to two children's charities in France.[262] Beckham has been supporting the charity named Help For Heroes for many years whose aim is to help soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghan wars.[263]  On 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old cancer patient from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, received a surprise phone call from Beckham. After the conversation, he sent her a Real Madrid jersey with his signature on it. Rebecca died on 29 January 2007.[264] On 1 July 2007, Beckham appeared as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.[265] Proceeds from the concert went to Diana's charities as well as to charities of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons.[266][267]  Beckham is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with Andy Murray at Wembley Stadium. Beckham also appeared in a 2007 public service announcement for Malaria No More U.S, advertising the need for inexpensive bed nets. The TV spot aired in the United States on Fox Networks, including Fox Soccer Channel, and can also be seen on YouTube.[268]  Since joining Major League Soccer, Beckham has been a very public advocate in the United States for related charities such as ""MLS W.O.R.K.S."" On 17 August 2007, he conducted a youth clinic in Harlem, along with other current and former MLS players. This was in advance of his first New York City area match the following day against the New York Red Bulls. That team's Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo Ángel were also with Beckham, teaching skills to disadvantaged youth to benefit FC Harlem Lions.[269]  Appearances in films  Beckham never personally appeared in the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham, except in archive footage. He and his wife wanted to make cameo appearances, but scheduling proved difficult, so the director used lookalike Andy Harmer instead.[270]  Beckham makes a cameo appearance with Zinedine Zidane and Raúl, in the 2005 film Goal!. Harmer also doubled for him in the party scene.[271] Beckham himself appears in the sequel Goal II: Living the Dream[272] in a larger role, when the film's lead character gets transferred to Real Madrid. This time, the story centres on the Real Madrid team, and besides Beckham, other real life Real Madrid players also appear on and off the pitch, alongside the fictional characters. Though the use of stock footage from the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Beckham appeared in Goal III: Taking on the World, which was released straight to DVD on 15 June 2009.[273] Beckham has expressed no personal interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is too ""stiff"".[274]  However, due to his friendship with Guy Ritchie, he has made two cameo appearances in Ritchie's films: as a projectionist in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (based on the 1964 MGM television series of the same name),[275] and as Trigger in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.[276]  Beckham has played along to jokes about his voice. In a 2018 promo for Deadpool 2, Beckham is seen watching the first instalment of the film franchise in which Ryan Reynolds' character compares Beckham's voice to inhaling helium.[277] Beckham is seen rolling his eyes at the voice jibe before receiving an apology text from Deadpool. Beckham answers his door to the antihero who presents him with milk and cookies, before Deadpool knocks again and has a bunch of helium-filled red balloons.[277]  Records  Beckham captained England 59 times,[278] the fourth highest after Bobby Moore and Billy Wright both with 90, and Bryan Robson with 65. With his free kick goal against Ecuador in the second round of the 2006 World Cup, Beckham gained membership into two of football's exclusive clubs: he became the only English player – and the 21st player in the world – to score in three World Cups; Real Madrid teammate Raúl also achieved this feat a few days earlier.[279] It also made him only the fifth player in World Cup history to score twice from a direct free kick; the other four were Pelé, Roberto Rivelino, Teófilo Cubillas, and Bernard Genghini (Beckham had previously scored this way against Colombia in the first round of the 1998 World Cup). All three goals were against South American teams (Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador) and from set pieces (the two aforementioned free kicks and a penalty against Argentina).[162][177]  Tattoos  As of 2016, Beckham had more than 40 tattoos.[280] There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in Sanskrit script because Beckham thought it would be ""tacky"" to have it in English. Unfortunately, this was misspelt as the equivalent of ""Vihctoria"".[281] In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: ""I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.""[282]  Awards  Career statistics  Club  [285][286]  International  [287][288][289]  England national team Year Apps Goals 1996 3 0 1997 9 0 1998 8 1 1999 7 0 2000 10 0 2001 10 5 2002 9 3 2003 9 4 2004 12 2 2005 9 1 2006 8 1 2007 5 0 2008 8 0 2009 8 0 Total 115 17  International goals  Scores and results list England's goal tally first.[290][291]  Honours  Club  Manchester United Youth  Manchester United[246]  Real Madrid[246]  LA Galaxy[246]  Paris Saint-Germain[246]  Individual  Orders and special awards  Records  See also  References  Books  Beckham, David (2002).

"Every girl loves flowers, right? Well, Scott Disick may be testing that theory.  Splash News  Earlier this week, Bella Thorne took to Snapchat to show off a large bouquet of flowers that she received. A few hours later, Kourtney Kardashian took to Snapchat to show off a huge bouquet of flowers that she received.  Both sets of flowers looking quite similar in size, type and color.  According to multiple reports, the flowers were sent to both women by Scott -- perhaps as a bit of mea culpa for his recent behavior.  TMZ (who has images of the flowers) reported on June 15 that Bella's flowers were indeed sent from Scott. Bella shared the image in which her hair matched the color of the roses. ""Now I match z flowers,"" she said.  Scott, if you'll recall, took Bella to the Cannes Film Festival and proceeded to flirt with a parade of women. The actress went home early and reports said she felt ""used"" by Scott.  Splash News  On May 25 she tweeted, ""Yo this #cannes fancy life isn't for me"" to her 6.6 million followers. She later said, ""I'm not talking to scott or anyone else"" before including a hashtag with an expletive.  When another fan inquired what she was doing with the ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star Bella responded, ""Legit nothing trolololo""  Kourtney, meanwhile, is said to be less than thrilled with the father of her three children and reportedly won't allow him to see their children unless he sobers up.  ""[Scott] is off the rails again... abusing alcohol and other substances,"" TMZ reported on May 28, citing sources close to Scott and Kourtney.  WCP/4CRNS/VM/FAMEFLYNET PICTURES  TMZ also wrote that even Scott's friends are frustrated with his troubling behavior. ""A few weeks ago they got Kourtney to call Scott and plead with him to get help, but he wasn't having it,"" TMZ reported.  Many friends have wondered if Scott's behavior can be linked to Kourtney's new romance with model Younes Bendjima.  ""Scott is jealous of Kourtney's relationship,"" a Kardashian source told Us Weekly in May, adding that ""he's realizing that getting back with Kourtney isn't going to happen."""	0
"No charges will be filed against Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, after the former Hills star filed a domestic abuse case against him, ET has learned.  Patridge called the Irvine Police Department on Sept. 6 after she stated in court papers that Bohan had been harassing her. After the investigation, the evidence was presented to the Orange County District Attorney’s office which, after review, rejected the case.  “The prosecutor reviewed all of the information provided by the Irvine Police Department and, unfortunately, the prosecutor did not feel that they would be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney’s office told ET on Monday.  Patridge's rep tells ET in a statement, ""Audrina is putting on a brave face, but these exchanges between Audrina and Corey are court ordered to take place at a police station for her protection. There is still a family law domestic violence case open.""  Corey Bohan Responds to Audrina Patridge's Restraining Order as She Requests He Be Forced Out of Their Home  Patridge and Bohan tied the knot last November after dating on and off since 2008, and share 1-year-old daughter, Kirra. Patridge filed for divorce on Wednesday, citing irreconcilable differences, and listed her and Bohan's date of separation as Sept. 6. According to court documents obtained by ET, two days prior to filing for divorce, Patridge requested a temporary restraining order against the Australian BMX rider for an alleged domestic violence incident. A judge in Orange County, California, granted Patridge's request, ordering Bohan to stay 100 yards away from her. Bohan was granted monitored visitation of Kirra, and their next hearing is set for Oct. 6.  ""Audrina’s No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time,"" Patridge's rep told ET at the time.  On Saturday, the 32-year-old reality star broke her silence about the divorce drama, posting a video of Kirra on Instagram.  ""Light of my life. This little beauty lights up the room wherever she is!"" she wrote. ""I appreciate all your thoughts & messages, this is a difficult time but we are doing ok xoxo.""

Was there ever any doubt that Stephen Colbert would use his platform at the Emmys to knock Donald Trump? The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale. The chorus? “Everything is better on TV”—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, “treason.” Once he finally took the stage—along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids—Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he’s just Walter, much whiter.”  “Unlike the presidency,” Colbert added, “Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Still, Colbert couldn’t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.  Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala’s crowd size: “This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” Spicer said with a straight face. “Both in person and around the world.”  “Wow,” Colbert said, “that really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.”  In the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.  Will the president respond? We’ll keep our eyes on his Twitter account while we’re not frantically analyzing tonight’s wins and snubs—although we have a feeling whatever response Trump has, it likely won’t come before two in the morning.

We’re obsessed with all things beauty here at PeopleStyle. We review every new product, track cool new trends (have you seen this unicorn-inspired makeup?) and snoop inside celebrities’ medicine cabinets whenever possible. So we can freely admit that whenever we take a trip to Sephora or Ulta we inevitably leave with a few more products than we anticipated buying. If you’re guilty too, it’s actually not all that unusual.  According to a new video by Money (above), the average woman will spend $43 on a shopping trip for makeup. (Our bank accounts may not thank us, but our vanities sure do.)  What really gave us a shock, though, was discovering that a woman spends $15,000 on beauty products in her lifetime. That’s a lot of lipsticks… or the cash for a used car!  Out of that money, $3,770 is spent on mascara alone (shop our favorite here!). Another $2,750 is allotted to eyeshadows (blue is totally in right now). And $1,780 is dedicated to new lipsticks (these are the celebrity shades we’re loving right now). And that’s not even including all the products you need to buy to keep your beauty tools clean.  RELATED PHOTOS: Celebs’ Beauty Routines: The Products They Really Use  If all of these numbers seem shocking, it makes a lot more sense when you consider the entire beauty industry is worth an astounding $382 billion globally.  Whoever said “you can’t put a price on beauty” was clearly misinformed.  How much money do you spend on an average trip to the makeup counter?	1
"The Material Girl, who has drawn the ire of the Vatican over the years, is eyeing luxury properties in two of the city's neighborhoods, according to reports.  ROME – Reportedly tiring of life in London and New York, the Material Girl is said it be mulling a move to the Eternal City.  The Italian media reported Wednesday that Madonna may be looking to acquire a luxury property in Rome.  The most likely candidates: a luxury villa on the Aventine Hill, or a penthouse apartment in the iconoclastic neighborhood designed by early 20th century architect Gino Coppede. There is no official word from the camp of the singer born as Madonna Louise Ciccone about a possible move, though the 54-year-old pop icon has always maintained close ties with Italy, the home of her ancestors.  Madonna’s personal donation of $500,000 to help the victims of the devastating 2009 earthquake in Abruzzo was at first larger than the aid from the U.S. government. She has also opined periodically on Italian affairs, and has been a vocal critic of media tycoon and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  VIDEO: Madonna Turns 54: Her Top 5 Hits  Madonna’s directorial effort, W.E., which told the story of the love story between British King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year.  But she has also been attacked repeatedly by the Vatican, which called the video for her 1989 hit ""Like a Prayer"" ""blasphemous"" for its visions of burning crosses, statues that cried blood and a scene where Madonna herself seduced a black actor playing Jesus Christ. In 2004, she was also criticized for promoting the Kabbalah religious belief, which the Vatican considers to be a threat to Roman Catholicism.  Most recently, church officials blasted her for the decision to sing while hanging from a crucifix during a 2006 concert in Rome. After that show, Cardinal Ersilio Tonino, speaking for Pope Benedict XVI, said, ""This time the limits have really been pushed too far. She should be excommunicated.""  She last attracted headlines in Italy in June, when during another concert in Rome, Madonna flashed her buttocks, revealing her black undergarments and fishnet stockings, to the delight of concertgoers.  Rome has been a popular destination for the entertainment world’s elite since the Dolce Vita days of the 1950s and 1960s. But in recent years, few top stars have gone as far as to move there."	1
Halle Berry Dumps Producer Boyfriend During Romantic Getaway  Can’t say we didn’t see this one coming… Another love affair has ended for Halle Berry!  Well to put it more accurately, 51-year-old Halle has called it quits with 35-year-old producer Alex Da Kid. And the way she did it was SO COLD!  According to In Touch reports, Halle broke up with Alex during a romantic vacation to Bora Bora:  “Halle broke up with Alex smack in the middle of their romantic getaway in Bora-Bora,” says a source, explaining that nearly halfway into the trip, Halle realized her five-month romance with the British music producer wasn’t working and had her assistant book her a flight home. “Halle decided he was too young and his communication skills were terrible. She said she needs someone who can think for themselves and is mature, smart and all-around adventurous,” the source explains to In Touch. Adds the source: “The last thing Halle needs is to be in a long-term relationship with a man who doesn’t express himself well.”  Yikes… Do you think he finished out the vacay or nah?	1
The rumour: Meghan Markle had a secret first husband  Where you heard it: The National Enquirer  The report: Markle’s status as divorcée has never been in dispute, but according to a new “bombshell” Enquirer cover story (is there any other kind?), Prince Harry will be the ex-actress’s third kick at the matrimonial can. “How she HID PAST from Husband No. 2!” claims one scandalous cover line, referring to “Man-eater Meghan’s” ex Trevor Engelson. Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was “blindsided” by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a “hush-hush annulment.”  Subscribe To Our Newsletters — And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox  The smell test: For the love of Liverpool — this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It’s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she’s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn’t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we’re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what’s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even “hush-hush annulments” are a matter of public record. The Enquirer’s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty’s Secret Service) probably “scrubbed the records” to conceal Markle’s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.  The rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie  Where you heard it: Vanity Fair  The report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple’s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It’s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” the movie’s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his “wife’s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.”  The smell test: What really reeks here is Huda’s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife’s connection, you can be sure he won’t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude — it’s called protecting your source.) Is the palace “seriously worried” about this movie? It’s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it’s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they’d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan’s premarital sex-fest wasn’t coming soon to a TV near you, but it’s not like it’s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal — a 1 being Kate Middleton’s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles’s tampon ambitions — this is a 2.  The rumour: Meghan’s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah  Where you heard it: The Mirror  The report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle’s mom visited Winfrey’s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O’s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed “US TV source,” who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: “It’s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,” quoth The Mirror’s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.  Rumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton ‘Hate Each Other’s Guts.’ Is That Really The Case?  The smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a “tell-all” if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a “tell-none” approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it’s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.  The rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring  Where you heard it: E! News  The report: This will-he-or-won’t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap “does want to wear a wedding band.” Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen’s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.  The smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that’s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan’s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.	1
"Kate Middleton and Prince William got married on April 29, 2011, and ever since that highly romantic/fated/legendary day, the Duchess has been wearing a pretty band made of Welsh gold on her ring finger. Look, here it is stacked next to her massive engagement bling:  Getty Images  Prince William, on the other hand, wears approximately NOTHING on his finger. Here he is meeting Paddington Bear, where you can see pretty clearly that he's not wearing a wedding band. And yes, maybe I took this as an opportunity to post a photo of Paddington Bear. No regrets.  Getty Images  So, now that we've established that William doesn't wear a ring, a couple of questions remain....  1. Did Kate Give Wills a Ring on Their Wedding Day?  Answer: Nope! Here's a video of their ceremony, where you can plainly see William pop a ring on Kate, and she pop nothing on him in return:  And here's a GIF in case your boss frowns on you watching ancient royal wedding videos at work:  Getty Images  2. Do Most Royal Men Wear Wedding Rings?  It depends, but mostly yes! Prince Charles wore a wedding band stacked behind his pinkie signet ring when he married Princess Diana:  Getty Images  And nowadays he wears a similar one as a symbol of his marriage to Camilla:  Getty Images  Meanwhile, Prince William's brother Prince Harry has been wearing a wedding ring since his marriage to Meghan Markle:  Getty Images  That said, Prince Philip (Queen Elizabeth's husband) doesn't wear a ring—so it's not like William is fully alone on a ring-less island.  3. So, Why Did William Opt Out?  The reason comes down to personal preference. Royal biographer Penny Junor told Vogue, ""He doesn’t like jewelry, and the Palace issued a statement before their wedding saying so.""  This is true, though it was less of a ""statement"" and more of an anonymous tip from a palace aide to veteran royal reporter Rebecca English. ""It was something the couple discussed but Prince William isn't one for jewelry—he doesn't even wear a signet ring—and decided he didn't want to,"" the aide confirmed. ""It really is just down to personal preference.""  The aide also claimed that Kate was completely fine with William's decision, adding, ""It is quite common for men in that strata of society not to wear a traditional wedding band. If they do, they tend to wear it with their family signet ring but William doesn't have one of those.""  Welp, there you have it. Kay, bye-bye as you were!"	0

Pop star David Cassidy has been hospitalized in Florida and is suffering from organ failure, according to his publicist.  The 67-year-old David Cassidy has previously admitted he was stricken with dementia, but now his liver and kidneys are failing, according to his publicist, JoAnn Geffen. She confirmed his hospitalization, noting, “he is now conscious and surrounded by family.”  Reports indicate Cassidy has been hospitalized for three days and is in critical condition. He has been in declining health for a while and has been open about his prior financial and health problems.  Cassidy, the star of The Partridge Family television show, last performed in March at the B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York.  The singer is suffering from kidney failure and needs a liver transplant, according to at least one report. Cassidy’s health has been in decline for more than two months, and his family has been told to prepare for the worst.  Cassidy revealed his dementia diagnosis earlier this year. He has also been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addition.  In February, he was a guest on the Dr. Phil show, and talked about falling on stage and forgetting the lyrics to one of his songs during an Agoura Hills, Calif. performance.  “When friends of yours or family members begin to say to you, ‘Remember, I just told you this two days ago,’ and there’s no memory of it, that’s when I began to be very concerned,” he said on the show.  Cassidy was arrested for three DUIs since 2010. A judge ordered him to rehab in 2014.  Cassidy, who comes from a show business family (father Jack Cassidy was an actor, and stepmother Shirley Jones starred with him on The Partridge Family), skyrocketed to fame for his role as Keith Partridge on the 1970s sitcom The Partridge Family, which aired from 1970-1974. He became a teen idol, fueling his fame with such heart-throb pop hits as I Think I Love You.  After that hit, Cassidy strove to become respected as a musician, and managed to produce the hit Cherish, which reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK pop charts. He went on to produce five solo albums during the series run, as well as ten credited to The Partridge Family, most of them million-sellers. Cassidy was also a major concert attraction, playing stadiums and arena-sized shows.  Cassidy struggled with his image as a frothy pop star, coming to grips with it and embracing it later in life. However, as he matured and his past glories faded, the ensuing years were not kind financially. The former star declared bankruptcy in 2015, blaming diminishing royalty checks for The Partridge Family, health issues that prevented him from touring, and bad investments.  The bankruptcy documents claimed: “While he still loves performing for his fans, it is more difficult to travel and perform in various parts of the United States or worldwide due to his health.”	0

(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she’s constantly finding ways to lose them with her inability to act decently in public and her outrageous attempts to place herself in the spotlight.She’s in the spotlight again, but it’s not the type of spotlight a celebrity should want to be in since this doesn’t seem to be a way to gain new fans.After her generic low-brow comments, some people might jokingly question if Kathy Griffin is a man. Nowadays, you just can’t tell anymore!How do you feel about Kathy Griffin’s remarks? Share your opinion and then post this on your Facebook page so other people can join the conversation.	1
Brody Jenner‘s relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner hasn’t always been an easy one to navigate.  On Wednesday, PEOPLE confirmed Caitlyn will not attend her son’s upcoming wedding to fiancée Kaitlynn Carter.  Caitlyn, 68, “has work commitments that have been set up for months and couldn’t be changed in the end,” a source told PEOPLE.  Nevertheless, the source said “everything is good” between the two, adding that Caitlyn “will be throwing a big party for them when the newlyweds return to town.”  And while there’s no bad blood over the wedding, Brody and Caitlyn haven’t always had such a smooth relationship.  Caitlyn Jenner and Brody Jenner Earl Gibson III/Getty  A Rocky Childhood  Caitlyn has long acknowledged that she was an absent father to her four oldest children Cassandra, Burt, Brandon and Brody.  While the older Jenner children were not regulars on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Brody did open up about his strained relationship with his father on the show in 2013.  (Caitlyn went by Bruce before transitioning in 2015. She now goes by Caitlyn and uses female pronouns.)  “I think Bruce is an incredible human being and I think that Bruce is a great father, he just wasn’t a great father to me,” he said.  Brody said Caitlyn and his mother Linda Thompson had a “messy divorce” when he was young, which created tension in the family.  “I grew up with my stepdad,” said Brody, referring to David Foster. “Bruce was never around. I can’t tell you how many birthdays went by where Bruce wasn’t there. I resent him for that.”  Brody’s strained relationship with Caitlyn also caused a rift in his bond with sisters Kendall and Kylie. A source tells PEOPLE that Brody was “never close” with his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian after Caitlyn married Kris Jenner.  “He didn’t spend a lot of time with his dad when his dad married Kris, so he didn’t see them as much,” the sources says.  And while Brody spent time with Kendall and Kylie when they were younger, they’ve grown apart.  “As much as they love them, they’re not close,” the source adds. “It’s unfortunate.”  Understanding Caitlyn’s Transition  Before transitioning, Caitlyn battled depression and identity issues, which caused her to pull away from her family.  “The big, formative years for them, I was really struggling with those issues [of gender identity],” she said during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.  Still, she takes full responsibility for not being there for her kids.  “There’s no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems that you have,” Jenner told ABC in 2017. “No excuse for that.”  And the former Hills star has remained supportive of Caitlyn‘s transition.  “The first thing I thought was just like, ‘It finally makes sense,'” Brody told ABC in 2017.  In fact, Brody said he actually prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.  John M. Heller/Getty Images;  “I’ve known Bruce for a long time and I didn’t really get along with Bruce,” he said. “Caitlyn and I get along a little more, because Caitlyn is actually who she really is and she’s living her life finally now as the person she actually was.”  Brody said he was able to start fresh with Caitlyn and let go of his resentment toward his father.  “It’s like getting to know somebody – your dad – all over again, in a better way.”  Brody’s siblings have expressed similar sentiments about their father’s transition.  “In seeing him come out to me and explain his true self, I was more proud right then to carry the last name Jenner, to be a part of the family, than at any time before,” said Brandon.  Rebuilding a Relationship  Both Brody and Caitlyn have been making more of an effort to spend time together in recent years.  In 2016, Caitlyn spent Thanksgiving with Brody and his siblings.  “Thanksgiving with family is the best. And mine keeps getting bigger,” she wrote. “I hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!”  In April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.  “Caitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They’re so happy for Brody,” a source tells PEOPLE. “Brody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.”  Caitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.  “Went to my first bridal shower,” Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. “I had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!”  “I’m so happy you were there!!!” Carter commented on the post. “It meant a lot to me!!”	1
Beijing | Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this morning and expressed their feelings that the American moon landings “were a complete hoax” reports the Beijing Daily Express.200 high-ranking officials from the Chinese Space Program have signed a petition asking explanations from the American government and the release of classified NASA information concerning the American moon landings that would prove to the World that the moon landings were not an elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the World about America’s space program capabilities.These allegations have come up through recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese moon rover that allegedly found no traces of the American moon landings existing on the moon.World renowned Russian nuclear engineer Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin has also signed the petition as well as a dozen other top Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents claiming the Russian Government “had always been aware of the situation since the early 1970’s”These recent discoveries could strangely give credence to conspiracy theorists whom have claimed for decades that America had never gone to the moon but that the American moon landings were but an elaborate hoax to foul Russia into the space race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining Russia, much like the financing of the Mujahideen forces during the Soviet Afghanistan war successfully achieved.	1

With Halloween right around the corner, it’s time to think costumes and treats. Though you’re on your own when it comes to costumes, Dunkin Donuts is coming in clutch with some spectacular seasonal treats. When you’re inevitably put on trick or treat duty — whether you’re chaperoning the little superhero in your life or answering the door for four hours straight — you’ll need the Almond Joy Hot Chocolate to keep you company.  The drink, which comes hot or cold, is the perfect infusion of milk chocolate, almond and coconut flavors. While, we definitely picture ourselves drinking this new hot chocolate during a snowstorm, we need this in our lives right now.  But Dunkin Donuts knows how to get into the Halloween spirit — it is a Massachusetts-based company, after all — so it’s also giving your favorite donuts a Halloween update. Forget about your regular old jelly donut because now, with a spooky upgrade it’s become Vampire’s Delight. Similarly, powder donuts are now Full moon, complete with orange powdered sugar.  Even the glazed donut has gotten a fun monster-themed change called Goulish Glazed. The Boston Kreme Donut, which is scary enough on it’s own, comes with a fun new decoration and a name: Boston Scream Donut. We’re sure the Sanderson sisters are going to be popping into their local Salem Dunkin’ to get their hands on a dozen or two.  While we’ll be drinking the Almond Joy Hot Chocolate as the weather turns even colder, we’re really hoping Dunkin Donuts keeps the flavor in stock all winter long.	0

Blac Chyna is defending herself as a caring mother after she was caught on camera swinging a baby stroller in a public altercation at a Six Flags amusement park on Easter Sunday.  The 29-year-old mother of King Cairo and Dream Kardashian—her children with Tyga and Rob Kardashian, respectively—was seen allegedly getting into an argument at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif. In videos shared on social media, Chyna is seen grabbing a pink stroller and swinging it around wildly. Neither child is seen in the footage, posted by Twitter user AliciaaAngiee.  The Tweets have since been deleted.  An eyewitness told E! News that the incident occurred at 6:45 p.m. at the exit of the X2 ride. It is not clear what incited the incident.  After the videos went viral, Chyna took to Instagram Stories to allude to a person setting her off by trying to touch her child. She did not reference the fight directly but the timing of the post appeared to coincide with the incident. She said she doesn't condone violence but she is a protective mother.  “Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it’s a whole other story,” she said. “I do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost.”  Chyna's new boyfriend, rapper YBN Almighty Jay, allegedly got involved in the altercation and tried to stop it, reports XXL. YBN and security reportedly attempted to restrain Chyna from the unidentified person.  [Photo: Getty Images]	0

"American singer, songwriter and actress  Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (; born September 4, 1981)[4] is an American singer, songwriter, performer, and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of the R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups in history. Their hiatus saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and the release of her debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album established her as a solo artist worldwide, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and earning five Grammy Awards, and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"".  Following the break-up of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained her fourth number one single, ""Irreplaceable"", as well as the top ten singles ""Déjà Vu"", and ""Beautiful Liar"". Beyoncé also continued her acting career, with starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the introduction of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed eponymous album, released in 2013 with no prior announcement, was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes. Her sixth album, Lemonade (2016), also received widespread critical acclaim, with many referring to it as her most personal and political work to date, and subsequently became the best-selling album of 2016. She released Everything Is Love, her seventh album, a collaboration with husband Jay-Z as The Carters in 2018.  Throughout her career, Beyoncé has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[5][6] She has won 22 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. She is also the most awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, with 24 wins, including the Video Vanguard Award.[7][8] The Recording Industry Association of America recognized Beyoncé as the Top Certified Artist in America, during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s decade, and awarded her their Millennium Award in 2011.[9][10][11] In 2014, she became the highest-paid black musician in history and was listed among Time's 100 most influential people in the world for a second year in a row.[12] Forbes ranked her as the most powerful female in entertainment on their 2015 and 2017 lists, and in 2016 she occupied the sixth place for Time's Person of the Year.[13] With the release of Lemonade, Beyoncé became the first and only musical act in Billboard chart history to debut at number one with their first six solo studio albums.[14]  Early life  Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine ""Tina"" Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[15] Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.[16] Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had No. 1 albums.[17] Mathew is African American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (African, Native American, and French).[16][18] Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard.[18] Beyoncé attended St. Mary's Montessori School in Houston, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[19] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's ""Imagine"" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[20][21] In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[23] and later Alief Elsik High School.[16][24] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years.[25]  When Beyoncé was eight, she and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[26] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[27] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[28][29] In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group.[30] The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.[16] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[26] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[16] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.[20]  Career  1997–2002: Destiny's Child  The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[31] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song ""Killing Time"" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[29] The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,[28] scoring their first major hit ""No, No, No"". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for ""No, No, No"". The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", the group's first number-one single, ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" and ""Say My Name"", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. ""Say My Name"" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[26] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[28] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song ""After All Is Said and Done"" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.[32]  LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[26] Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause.[33] Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time.[34] The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.[35] Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award, and she feared no one would take her seriously.[36] Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it.[35] Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.  The remaining band members recorded ""Independent Women Part I"", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[26] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[38] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[26] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[39] The album spawned other number-one hits, ""Bootylicious"" and the title track, ""Survivor"", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[40] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[26]  In July 2002, Beyoncé continued her acting career playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[41] which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $73 million.[42] Beyoncé released ""Work It Out"" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[43] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[44] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[45][46] Beyoncé released ""Fighting Temptation"" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[47] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, ""Summertime"", fared better on the US charts.[48]  2003–2007: Dangerously in Love and B'Day  Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's ""'03 Bonnie & Clyde"" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[50] Her first solo album Dangerously in Love was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[51] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[52] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[53] The album's lead single, ""Crazy in Love"", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[54] The single ""Baby Boy"" also reached number one,[49] and singles, ""Me, Myself and I"" and ""Naughty Girl"", both reached the top-five.[55] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for ""Dangerously in Love 2"", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for ""Crazy in Love"", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for ""The Closer I Get to You"" with Luther Vandross. During the ceremony, she performed with Prince.[56]  In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[57] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[58] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[59] Released on November 15, 2004, in the US[60] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[61][62] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles ""Lose My Breath"" and ""Soldier"", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[63] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It and during the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[64] The group released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25, 2005, in the US[65] and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.[66] The group has sold 60 million records worldwide.[67][68]  Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day was released on September 4, 2006, in the US, to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday.[69] It sold 541,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Beyoncé's second consecutive number-one album in the United States.[70] The album's lead single ""Déjà Vu"", featuring Jay-Z, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[55] The second international single ""Irreplaceable"" was a commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States.[55][71] B'Day also produced three other singles; ""Ring the Alarm"",[72] ""Get Me Bodied"",[73] and ""Green Light"" (released in the United Kingdom only).[74]  Her first acting role of 2006 was in the comedy film The Pink Panther starring opposite Steve Martin,[75] grossing $158.8 million at the box office worldwide.[76] Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical[77] loosely based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million internationally.[78][79][80] In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross.[81] To promote the film, Beyoncé released ""Listen"" as the lead single from the soundtrack album.[82] In April 2007, Beyoncé embarked on The Beyoncé Experience, her first worldwide concert tour, visiting 97 venues[83] and grossed over $24 million.[note 1] Beyoncé conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest. At the same time, B'Day was re-released with five additional songs, including her duet with Shakira ""Beautiful Liar"".[85]  2008–2010: I Am...

The appearance was considered controversial as it appeared to reference the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther Party and the NFL forbids political statements in its performances.[163][164][165] Immediately following the performance, Beyoncé announced The Formation World Tour, which highlighted stops in both North America, and Europe.[166][167] It ended on October 7, with Beyoncé bringing out her husband Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and Serena Williams for the last show.[168] The tour went on to win ""Tour of the Year"" at the 44th American Music Awards.[169]  On April 16, 2016, Beyoncé released a teaser clip for a project called Lemonade.

This would make Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[182] It was later announced on February 23, 2017 that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she will instead headline the 2018 festival.[183] Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[184]  At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and ""Formation"" respectively.[185] and ultimately won two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for ""Formation"".[186] Adele, upon winning her Grammy for Album of the Year, stated Lemonade was monumental and more deserving.[187]  On June 13, 2017, Beyoncé gave birth to twins Rumi and Sir Carter at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.[188] In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song ""Mi Gente"".

The couple announced the joint tour officially as On the Run II Tour on March 12[196] and simultaneously released a trailer for the tour on YouTube.[197] On March 20, 2018, the couple traveled to Jamaica to film a music video directed by Melina Matsoukas.[198]  On April 14, 2018, Beyoncé played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her April 14 performance, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[199][200]  On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, ""Apeshit"", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[201][202] Everything Is Love received generally positive reviews,[203] and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.[204] In film, Beyoncé will voice Nala in Jon Favreau's The Lion King, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2019.[205]  Artistry  Voice and songwriting  Saturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With ""Irreplaceable"", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the [206] With ""Single Ladies"", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day—then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With ""Irreplaceable"", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine —those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. ""Crazy in Love"" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in – thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. – Beyoncé  Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as ""one of the most compelling instruments in popular music"".[207] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[208] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is ""velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting"".[209] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[207] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was ""capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.""[210]  Beyoncé's music is generally R&B[211][212] and pop,[211][213] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[206] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[214]  She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts.[26] Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like ""Independent Women"" and ""Survivor"", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as ""Cater 2 U"".[215] Beyoncé has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.[216]  In 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards.[16][217] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (""Irreplaceable"", ""Grillz"" and ""Check on It"") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles.[218] (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song ""I Was Here"" for 4.[219]) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the ""Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters"", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[220]  Influences  Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[221] Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[222] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, ""if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.""[223] She admires Diana Ross as an ""all-around entertainer""[224] and Whitney Houston, who she said ""inspired me to get up there and do what she did.""[225] She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song ""Vision of Love"" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[226][227] Her other musical influences include Aaliyah,[228] Prince,[229] Lauryn Hill,[224] Sade Adu,[230] Donna Summer,[231] Mary J. Blige,[232] Janet Jackson,[233] Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.[224]  The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[234] and by singer Josephine Baker.[235] Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing ""Déjà Vu"" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[236] Beyoncé's third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose ""boldness"" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles.[237] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[206]  Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying ""She proves you can do it all""[238] and she has described Oprah Winfrey as ""the definition of inspiration and a strong woman"".[224] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[239] Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter ""what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music... he is lyrical and raw"".[240][241] In February 2013, Beyoncé said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented, ""I think about Madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists. But there are not enough of those women."".[242]  Music videos and stage  In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song in B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[243] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for ""Irreplaceable"" and ""Green Light"".[214] The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, 2009–2010 I Am... World Tour, 2013–2014 The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and 2016 The Formation World Tour.  Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post placed her at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers.[244] According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage,[245] while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she ""takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.""[246] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive.[247] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[248][249] Beyoncé's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as Malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.[250]  Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, ""You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.""[251]  Alter ego  Described as being ""sexy, seductive and provocative"" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego ""Sasha Fierce"" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha as being ""too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy"", stating, ""I'm not like her in real life at all.""[35] Sasha was conceived during the making of ""Crazy in Love"", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[252] However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[253]  Public image  Dreamgirls Beyoncé at the premiere for her 2006 film,  Beyoncé has been described as having a wide-ranging sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has ""become a crossover sex symbol"".[254] Offstage Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress ""is absolutely for the stage.""[255] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s (decade), the media often used the term ""Bootylicious"" (a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious) to describe Beyoncé,[256][257] the term popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same name. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[258]  External image Knowles's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover from February 15, 2007  In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[259] She was named ""World's Most Beautiful Woman"" by People[260] and the ""Hottest Female Singer of All Time"" by Complex in 2012.[261] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its ""100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century"" list.[262][263] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[264] Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world, including New York,[265] Washington, D.C.,[266] Amsterdam,[267] Bangkok,[268] Hollywood[269] and Sydney.[270]  According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[271] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style[272] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[273] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[274] In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after Tyra Banks,[275] and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.[276]  The BeyHive is the name given to Beyoncé's fan base. Fans were previously titled ""The Beyontourage"", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage). The name Bey Hive derives from the word beehive, purposely misspelled to resemble her first name, and was penned by fans after petitions on the online social networking service Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[277]  In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[278] In 2011, she appeared on the cover of French fashion magazine L'Officiel, in blackface and tribal makeup that drew criticism from the media. A statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine said that Beyoncé's look was ""far from the glamorous Sasha Fierce"" and that it was ""a return to her African roots"".[279]  Beyoncé's lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community.[280] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[280] In 2008, L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that ""it is categorically untrue"",[281][282] and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed ""retouching"" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only ""natural pictures be used"".[283]  Personal life  Beyoncé performing on the I Am... World Tour with Jay-Z, whom she married in 2008  Marriage and children  Beyoncé started a relationship with Jay-Z after their collaboration on ""'03 Bonnie & Clyde"",[284] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[285] Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fuelling speculation about their relationship.[286] On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity.[86] As of April 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[154] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years.[287] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[288][289]  Beyoncé suffered a miscarriage around 2010 or 2011, describing it as ""the saddest thing"" she had ever endured.[290] She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[291] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed ""Love on Top"" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[292] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[293] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for ""most tweets per second recorded for a single event"" on Twitter,[294] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[295] and ""Beyonce pregnant"" was the most Googled term the week of August 29, 2011.[296] On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[297]  On February 1, 2017 she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million ""likes"" within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[298] On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017 and the names Rumi and Sir Carter.[299] The twins were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California. Rumi, the daughter, was born before Sir, the son.[300] She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the iconic September 2018 of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[301][302]  Activism  Beyoncé performed ""America the Beautiful"" at the 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as ""At Last"" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[303] They held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[304] which raised $4 million.[305] In the 2012 Presidential election, Beyoncé voted for Obama.[306] She performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration in January 2013.[136] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[307] She also headlined for Hillary Clinton in a 2016 concert held the weekend before Election Day. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore ""I'm with her"" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, ""I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.""[308]  In 2013, Beyoncé stated in an interview with Vogue that she considered herself to be ""a modern-day feminist"".[309] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling ""We should all be feminists"", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song ""Flawless"", released later that year.[310] In 2014 she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading ""FEMINIST.""[311] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses television and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[312] Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[313]  Beyoncé publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[314] Beyoncé spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[315] She has also condemned police brutality against black Americans. Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin.[316] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for ""Freedom"".[317] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song ""Formation"" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, ""I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me"".[318]  In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[319]  Wealth  Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[320][321] They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[322] and ninth on the ""Most Powerful Women in the World"" list in 2010.[323] The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the ""Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30"" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[324][325] In the same year, Beyoncé and Jay-Z placed at number one on the ""World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples"", for collectively earning $78 million.[326] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the ""highest-earning power couple"" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[327] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[328] In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry.[329] That year, Beyoncé was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[330]  MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyoncé would become the highest-paid black musician in history;[331] this became the case in April 2014.[332] In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[333] In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. Herself and Jay-Z also topped the highest paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[334] As of May 2017, Forbes calculated her net worth to be $350 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the second-highest earning celebrity with annual earnings of $105 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[335][336] As a couple with Jay-Z, they have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[337] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[338]  Legacy  Beyoncé performing during her I Am... World Tour in 2009  In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as ""the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century..... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.""[339] When The Observer named her Artist of the Decade, Llewyn-Smith wrote:  Why Beyoncé? [...] Because she made not one but two of the decade's greatest singles, with 'Crazy in Love' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)', not to mention her hits with Destiny's Child; and this was the decade when singles – particularly R&B singles – regained their status as pop's favourite medium. [...] [She] and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years.[340]  In 2013, Beyoncé made the Time 100 list, with Baz Luhrmann writing:  No one has that voice, no one moves the way she moves, no one can hold an audience the way she does... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA – the reigning national voice.[341]  In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured on the cover of the issue.[342]  Beyoncé's work has influenced numerous artists including Britney Spears,[343] Adele,[344] Bebe Rexha,[345] Ariana Grande,[346][347] Lady Gaga,[348] Ellie Goulding,[349] Rihanna,[350] Iggy Azalea,[351] Demi Lovato,[352] Tinashe,[353] Kelly Rowland,[354][355] Sam Smith,[356] Nicole Scherzinger,[357] Jessica Sanchez,[358] Cheryl,[359] JoJo,[360] Meghan Trainor,[361] Grimes,[362][363] Rita Ora,[364] Zendaya,[365] Alexis Jordan,[366] Bridgit Mendler,[367] and Azealia Banks.[368] American indie rock band White Rabbits also cited her an inspiration for their third album Milk Famous (2012),[369] friend Gwyneth Paltrow[370] studied Beyoncé at her live concerts while learning to become a musical performer for the 2010 film Country Strong.[371]  Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork noticed her contribution in changing the sound of pop music radio with her hip-hop assisted style, writing:  Her hip-hop fluency gave her an advantage in the pop-star arms race, helping her to become the presiding voice in an increasingly rap-dominated musical landscape. Her evolution, from rap-adjacent R&B star (appearing as early as 1998 in a Geto Boys video) to reluctant hip-hop shareholder to full-blown rapper, played a role in slowly shifting the sound of pop radio.[372]  Her debut single, ""Crazy in Love"" was named VH1's ""Greatest Song of the 2000s"",[373] NME's ""Best Track of the 00s""[374] and ""Pop Song of the Century"",[375] considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time, earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time at around 8 million copies. The music video for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography[376] and its deployment of jazz hands,[377] was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the ""first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet"",[96] triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography[378][379] and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube.[376][378] In 2013, Drake released a single titled ""Girls Love Beyoncé"", which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's ""Say My Name"" and discussed his relationship with women.[380] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[381] In July 2014, a Beyoncé exhibit was introduced into the ""Legends of Rock"" section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The black leotard from the ""Single Ladies"" video and her outfit from the Super Bowl half time performance are among several pieces housed at the museum.[382] Architects credit Beyoncé's look in her ""Ghost"" music video as the inspiration of the design of the Premier Tower under construction in Australia.[383]  The City of Minneapolis, Minnesota declared May 23 Beyoncé Day in the city in 2016.[384] In 2018, the City of Columbia, South Carolina declared August 21 Beyoncé Knowles-Carter Day in the city after presenting her with the keys to Columbia.[385]  Achievements  Beyoncé has received numerous awards. As a solo artist she has sold over 17 million albums in the US, and over 100 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[386][387][388][389][390][391] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[392][393] Her songs ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"", ""Halo"", and ""Irreplaceable"" are some of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide. In 2009, The Observer named her the Artist of the Decade[340] and Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[9][394][395] In 2010, Billboard named her in their ""Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years"" list at number 15.[396] In 2012 VH1 ranked her third on their list of the ""100 Greatest Women in Music"", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[397] Beyoncé was honored with the International Artist Award at the 2007 American Music Awards.[398] She has also received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards, the Billboard Millennium Award at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and the Fashion Icon Award at the 2016 CFDA Awards.[399]  Beyoncé has won 22 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child, making her the second most honored female artist by the Grammys, behind Alison Krauss[400][401] and the most nominated woman in Grammy Award history with a total of 62 nominations.[402] ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" won Song of the Year in 2010 while ""Say My Name"",[26] ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Drunk in Love"" have each won Best R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have all won Best Contemporary R&B Album, while Lemonade has won Best Urban Contemporary Album. Beyoncé set the record for the most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night in 2010 when she won six awards, breaking the tie she previously held with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, and Amy Winehouse, with Adele equaling this in 2012.[403]  Beyoncé has also won 24 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the most-awarded artist in Video Music Award history.

The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[429] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[430] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[431]  Fashion lines  Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.[432] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress.[433][434] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style.

Mariah Carey may now be wishing things would have worked out with her billionaire ex-fiancé James Packer! The singer’s high-end SoCal shopping spree turned “embarrassing” when her credit cards were declined, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.  “She was shopping on Rodeo Drive and her credit cards were declined,” an eyewitness told Radar. “When it happened at Louis Vuitton she thought it was a fluke. But when it happened three more times she was embarrassed and humiliated.”  Carey, 47, played it off like it was a mistake, as she left and came back to purchase the high-end items.  PHOTOS: Mariah Carey Caught Making Out With Ex Boytoy Bryan Tanaka  “She returned with an assistant and her manager Stella [Bulochnikov], who made a total scene,” the eyewitness said.  Bulochnikov is the lucky standup comedian-turned-music manager who was on the receiving end of Carey’s once-hefty bank account when the singer shelled out a whopping $34,000 on a Louis Vuitton trunk for her 44th birthday.  Yet, despite her cards not going through this time around, Carey didn’t walk away empty-handed.  PHOTOS: Sorry, Nick! Mariah Carey Is Dating Bryan Tanaka Again  “They ended up paying cash,” said the source. “But Mariah is blaming her manager for the cancelations, postponement and low ticket sales of her tour with Lionel Richie. She’s also had bad press and business deals. Stella keeps saying everything is going to be all right, but it’s not.”  This isn’t the only bad luck in the bucks department the Grammy winner has faced recently.  The superstar has spent millions she may not have on her new boy toy Bryan Tanaka only after she called off her South American shows because of late payments. She is currently suing the concert promoter.  PHOTOS: Turning Heads! Curvy Mariah Carey Busts Out Of Sheer Top In Barcelona  The music legend also only raked in $6.3 million in 2014 and demanded $50 million from her former businessman beau Packer after their engagement imploded.  She also had a disastrous live performance on New Year’s Eve, and her The House co-star recently called her out for being “unprofessional and borderline abusive” on set.  We pay for juicy info!

Together at last! Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus made things official during Monday, June 4, episode of Teen Mom 2. Even though they tried to act like one big happy family with their children, their relationship with Kailyn Lowry couldn’t be worse. Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week’s episode of Teen Mom 2.  Chelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe  It was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter’s last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer’s name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn’t be more nervous to faceher ex, who she hadn’t seen in about a year.  “I hate that I doubt myself,” Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. “Am I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?”  In the end, everything went Chelsea’s way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.  “I just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,” Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.  Briana and Javi are Official  After weeks of beating around the bush, Briana finally admitted that she and Javi were “boyfriend and girlfriend.” She went to Delaware to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday with the kids. She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.  “I’m looking forward to today,” Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. “It’s nice having you by my side,” he told her.  Even though last week’s episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.  When Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln’s party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi’s ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.  “Shut the f—k up cause now I’m mad. S—k my d—k, you dumb bitch,” Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn’t want to meet up with her to talk thing about.  After that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. “I don’t think that she’s a good person,” Kailyn said. “I don’t want anything to do with him.”  Nathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle  Jenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page. However, the change made rumors swirl that she and David Eason were breaking up because her page no longer mentioned they were together. Her ex Nathan Griffith didn’t waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.  “You don’t know s—t about Kaiser. You don’t ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I’m broken up with David,” Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one’s surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was suppose to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David’s mother to avoid drama.  However, Nathan was so made about the texts, he went after David’s mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. “They need to get off the drugs,” Nathan said. “I won’t do this no more.”  Leah Opens Up To Her Daughter  Leah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter’s problems in front of her, which made it awkward.  “It was hard to talk about why you’re not always the nicest to Ali,” Leah told Aleeah afterward. “Even when you have a bad day, I still love you.”  Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Hands shaking and heart pumping, athletes from all over the world take to the podium with tear-stained faces, radiant smiles and unbridled euphoria. They watch in genuine wonderment as their nation’s flag rises and the stadium resounds with the thunderous tones of their national anthem. These awe-inspiring moments draw the eyes of half the world to the Olympic Games, where spectators marvel at the unfathomable tenacity and strength of the world’s best athletes.  Yet those triumphant moments provide only superficial insight into an athlete’s tumultuous trek to victory. Their journeys took stamina and determination, but for too many athletes, it also took much more: their innocence, pride, self-worth and well-being, a merciless charge in exchange for success.  In too many cases, the winner is expected to take it all – the psychological and physical pain, the sexual abuse and the animosity of teammates in silence and with unfaltering national pride. Nowhere is this more evident or troubling than in USA Gymnastics.  Clad in sparkly, red-white-and-blue spandex, the female USA gymnasts are images of strength, grace and patriotism. Winning consecutive Olympic golds in 2012 and 2016, in addition to world championships in 2011, 2014 and 2015, the USA Women’s Gymnastics program has distinguished itself as a force to be reckoned with. The women have not only racked up quite the collection of gold medals, but they have also accrued millions of views and brought abundant media attention to the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.  During the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 38.7 million viewers tuned into NBC’s broadcast of the Women’s Gymnastics final, where the U.S. women dominated. In fact, in 2012, four of the five members of the “Fierce Five” ranked in the “Top 10 Most Clicked Athletes” on NBC’s Olympics.com, with Gabby Douglas leading with over 23 million clicks to her page. These women are the pride and joy of the U.S. Olympic Committee, not to mention national and international sensations.

But the thinly veiled facade is beginning to fade, most notably with the well-founded sexual abuse allegations against USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, by over 150 women and girls, according to CNN.  Among those victims were gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber. They each had a story to tell, rife with gruesome details of long-term abuse.  It is the dismaying story of McKayla Maroney, a “Fierce Five” member and silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, that perhaps most aptly encapsulates both Nassar’s menace and USA Gymnastics’ negligence. In the fall of 2017, Maroney made a startling announcement via Twitter that Nassar had abused her from the time she was thirteen years old until she left gymnastics in 2016, according to Time Magazine.  “I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting,” Maroney said. The gymnast recounted a particularly traumatic event on a flight to Tokyo when Nassar gave her a sleeping pill. The next thing Maroney remembered was waking up alone with Nassar in his hotel room enduring one of his “treatments.” She was 15 years old.  While it is shocking that a predator like Nassar was able to worm his way into this esteemed organization and continue his abuse for years without notice, the organization’s handling of the travesty was unprofessional, unpardonable and downright unethical.  While USA Gymnastics commended Maroney’s courage when she publicly announced the horrors she endured, it soon came to light that a year earlier, the organization made her “sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of a financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment,” according to NBC.  On Dec. 20, 2017, Maroney filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the agreement she signed was “hypocritical, immoral and in this case illegal,” said Maroney’s attorney. In response, on Jan. 16, 2018, USA Gymnastics ensured that it would not hound Maroney for any money should she choose to speak out. But even with this turnaround, the sheer reality that this rectification was even necessary is utterly unspeakable.  A symphony of voices rose in corroboration of Maroney’s claims, and 156 women delivered grievous and powerful statements in front of Nassar’s very eyes during a seven-day-long trial. Aly Raisman, team captain of both the “Fierce Five” and the “Final Five,” has become a vocal advocate for her fellow victims and delivered a harrowing testimony at Nassar’s trial.  “I have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully. And both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,” Raisman said. “But did they reach out when I came forward? No.”  You might also like: Love or a Gold Medal? Two Olympic Ice Skaters Break Up to Win  But the sins of the organization did not develop overnight. In fact, this sickening culture laid down its roots many years ago. The Washington Post reported that since 1982, “more than 290 coaches and officials associated with the United States’ Olympic sports organizations have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct,” spanning 15 Olympic sports. Yet even aside from all the sexual abuse, the organizations’ transgressions still run deep, and if you pay close enough attention to history, the signs are evident.  One of the Olympics most spectacular and inspirational moments for the U.S. occurred during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, when U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug was exhorted by coach Bela Karolyi to perform the last vault on a critically sprained ankle. Despite her injury, she completed the vault, and led the U.S. women to victory over the Russians for the first time ever. However, malevolence lurks even in the Games’ most glorified moments.  The first feeling the video elicits from viewers is almost always one of admiration for the 18-year-old Strug, who somehow miraculously landed on one foot. But when you witness the agonizing pain on this young girl’s face, and Karolyi’s seemingly heartless coercion, the picture slowly turns from heartening to unsettling. To make matters worse, one of the doctors helping Strug off the stage is none other than Larry Nassar himself.  From being forced to practice on broken limbs, doping at the urging of coaches and acquiescing to irrational diets, Olympic athletes withstand unthinkable afflictions and tribulations en route to domination at the Games.  The 2017 feature film “I, Tonya,” provided yet another startling reminder of the cutthroat nature of the Games; it resurrected the 1994 attack on U.S. Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, which soon implicated Tonya Harding, her own teammate and possible conspirator in the attack.

It will become their personal hell. Olympic gold medal winner Shawn Johnson even went so far as to say in a YouTube video on her channel, “I think gymnastics is the best sport in the entire world, but if I had a daughter right now, I wouldn’t put her in it.”  With news stories, personal testimonies and unearthed history inundating almost every media platform, it has become increasingly difficult to look past the Games’ faults and focus on their worth. In order to preserve an honorable tradition and progress in a positive way, major reform is necessary.  The U.S. Olympic Committee needs to genuinely recommit itself to cultivating an organization characterized for its emphasis on unity, not duplicity. In addition, the U.S. Olympic teams must forge environments that do not alienate future generations of athletes, but instead encourage and ignite the most inspired work and dedication they can give.  There is a black, rotting hole corroding the Games from the inside, and now is the time to wipe it out. Let the upcoming PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games be the birthplace of a new era, so when these world-class athletes take the stage, country flags ascending and anthems blaring, they can be filled with authentic, unadulterated ardor for the organization and country whose names they proudly bear.	0
"Angelina Jolie's changing physique has been alarming fans throughout the year. The actress has lost a drastic amount of weight following her split from Brad Pitt and now, a new rumour claims that the actress is also stopped eating and sleeping properly.  There are rumours doing the rounds claiming that Jolie is undergoing 'health crisis' and is ""on the verge of passing out."" The claims published by National Enquirer say that the actress is surviving on steamed vegetables and fruits. However, Gossip Cop sources say otherwise.

The outlet's source adds that Jolie's ""food intake is mostly morsels of steamed veggies and fruit, very little protein, and water. She drinks wine and smokes cigarettes. The fear is she's headed for a physical meltdown.""  Although it is true that Jolie has been had some health issues in the past, Gossip Cop's sources debunk these claims to share that the National Enquirer's report is not true. Friends of the actress told the gossip site that there is no truth in the claims.  While she might not be headed for a physical breakdown, Jolie has informed fans that she has had a few health issues she has been dealing with. In a recent interview, the actress did confess to suffering from hypertension but fortunately recovered from it.  ""Emotionally it's been a very difficult year. And I have some other health issues. So, my health is something I have to monitor,"" she told the Sunday Telegraph.  Earlier this year, the star also revealed that she had developed Bell's palsy. But she changed her lifestyle and took control of things. ""I'm being smart about my choices, and I'm putting my family first, and I'm in charge of my life and my health,"" the actress told Vanity Fair.  ""I can't tell if it's menopause or if it's just been the year I've had,"" she had told the magazine referring to her drier skin and grey strands."	1
"The premium cable network has also announced that season four will bow in November.  No surprise here: Starz has extended Outlander for two additional seasons.  The premium cable network on Wednesday announced that it has renewed the Ron Moore drama based on Diana Gabaldon's best-selling book series for seasons five and six. Starz also revealed that the 13-episode fourth season of the time-traveling period soap will return in November. (A specific return date has yet to be announced.)  All told, the renewal is for 24 total episodes, with each season consisting of 12 episodes. That is Outlander's lowest per-season total after the freshman run consisted of 16 and seasons two and three were 13 apiece.

The drama is executive produced by Moore, Maril Davis, Toni Graphia, Matthew B. Roberts and Andy Harries.

Fans have always longed for ’90s golden couple Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to get back together — something Justin Theroux became keenly aware of two years ago when he found love notes Aniston had saved from the heartthrob, a source recalls in the new issue of Us Weekly.  “He stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” a source tells Us. “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already.’”  The source explains that impact of those little notes was huge. “Jen assured him they weren’t a big deal, but Justin wasn’t thrilled … Justin had moments of insecurity like that.”  As previously reported, Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, announced their separation on Thursday, February 15, via a joint statement: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux’s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, called it quits in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.  “Jen has struggled with the perception that she is this pathetic woman after the divorce from Brad,” the insider tells Us. “It played a role in her wanting to marry Justin.”  For more on Aniston and Theroux’s split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

Arie and Lauren, the happy couple. (Paul Hebert/ABC)  It has not been a great week for Arie Luyendyk Jr. The 36-year-old race-car-driver-turned-real-estate-agent faced immense backlash after his turn as ABC’s “The Bachelor” when he proposed to Becca Kufrin, a 27-year-old publicist from Minnesota, and then blindsided her with a breakup so he could propose to the runner-up, Lauren Burnham, a 25-year-old salesperson from Virginia.  So, as is tradition, the final “Bachelor” couple has to embark on ABC talk show appearances after the finale — and for Arie, it has naturally turned pretty defensive. By Thursday, even Becca — just named the newest Bachelorette — was halfheartedly defending him during an interview with “Good Morning America.”  “He had to do what he had to do. And I don’t fault him for that,” Becca said, in response to whether she felt “ambushed” by the breakup. “I would want him to follow his heart and not to feel trapped in a relationship with me. At the end of the day, if it had to happen, then it had to happen.”  Here are three takeaways from Arie’s press tour:  [A legislator has a bill to ban ‘The Bachelor’s’ Arie Luyendyk Jr. from Minnesota]  Arie has multiple explanations for breaking up with Becca on camera.  Viewers were stunned on Monday night upon seeing the footage of Becca, who thought she was arriving at a house in Los Angeles to spend a romantic weekend with Arie. Instead, he had brought along a camera crew to film as he called off their engagement because he was still in love with Lauren.  Arie was roasted on social media for this decision — while the producers probably encouraged it, they swear the cameras were Arie’s choice — and some of our country’s top TV personalities were equally confused.  “There’s a lot of backlash from a lot of people,” Michael Strahan said Wednesday on “Good Morning America,” reading tweets from former “Bachelor” contestants who thought the show went too far. “Why was the decision made to film this? It probably could have been done — I think a lot of people felt — in a more quiet way.”  “I really wanted everyone to know that this was on me, this was my fault. And I felt like filming that would let people know that. That if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup,” Arie explained. “And I wanted her that opportunity — honestly, I wanted her the opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.”  That reasoning was similar to Arie’s thinking that he shared during the finale, about how he wanted to be fully transparent. But essentially saying he was doing a good thing because he knew it would help Becca be named the Bachelorette? Apparently, he thinks he did her a favor.  On Wednesday’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” Kelly Ripa called Arie “shady” and said the choice to air the extended breakup was “excessively cruel.”  “Why break up with Becca like you did on camera and why 40 minutes of us seeing her in so much pain?” Ryan Seacrest asked.  Arie emphasized that although he wanted to film the breakup, he didn’t decide to air the whole thing — that was the producers’ call.  “Through every breakup there’s always questions of what went wrong. And I knew if we did it on camera that I could take ownership of it and that it was completely my fault and my doing. I thought that was important,” Arie said, echoing his earlier answer. “And the whole thing started on camera, and I wanted the story to be told all the way to the end.”  Ah, so he also wanted to do it for continuity’s sake. Good to know.  Arie wants everyone to know he’s fine with the backlash.  Social media users have not been kind. “Are you worried about how people are going to react to your relationship with Lauren?” Michael Strahan asked on “GMA.”  “I think that, you know, you’d love to have the support from people online, but what really matters is our relationship, our family, our friends, and they’re all on board,” Arie said.  Lauren repeated this idea when she joined Arie later in the interview, and Strahan asked again about how they’re handling the haters.  “If either of us is struggling, we come to each other and try to make light of any kind of hate we get. Just kind of joke around,” she said.  “I think we try to turn it around and try to poke fun at things. Some things are kind of funny,” Arie said, noting that he and Lauren “didn’t get the best edit” on the show. “As long as we have each other, we’ll be okay.”  Arie and Lauren have already started planning the wedding.  At least, that’s what they told Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. Kimmel was shocked when he asked them a question about whether Arie changes his mind a lot when he’s out at dinner, and Lauren responded that they’ve never actually been to dinner before.  “You haven’t been to a restaurant together? Oh, you should definitely get married right away,” Kimmel deadpanned.  Arie and Lauren also cuddled through every interview, with lots of public displays of affection. They told Ripa and Seacrest that they’re headed out of the country on vacation, and when they get back, they’re going to pack up Lauren’s belongings in Virginia and drive to Phoenix, where they’ll live together. In other words, this disastrous situation was worth it, because they’re soul mates.  “I know it’s difficult for a lot of people to swallow, but I’m happy. And it took a long, hard road to get here,” Arie said. “But I’m really solid in my relationship, and we have been together since January and it’s going really well. And I knew this was going to be a tough week for me.”  Read more:  This ‘Bachelor’ expert says watching the show has made her a smarter dater  The worst moments from an awkward ‘Bachelor’ finale that just kept going  ‘The Bachelor’ tries to do damage control after disastrous finale, but only makes things worse	0
When John and I got together, I found my love for cooking. On one of our earliest dates, I took him to Daniel ( four dollar signs on Yelp, ahhh! ). I drank a $40 margarita, ate salmon rillettes (fancy salmon spread), and prayed my card wouldn’t be declined. I couldn’t afford to take him out to more dinners like that, so I started cooking more and more at home for us. I started with my own version of that salmon spread, then roasted whole branzino, osso buco, chipotle BBQ chicken. When my first cookbook came out, I finally felt proud of my work. I feel that same pride in Lip Sync Battle , where I get to work with LL Cool J and watch Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan go head-to-head as Beyoncé and motherf-cking Paula Abdul. My job, essentially, is to have the best time humanly possible.  Let me start here: To a lot of you, I think, I seem like the happiest person on the planet. I have an incredible husband—John and I have been together for over 10 years. He has seen my successes and failures; I’ve seen his. He has seen me at my worst, but I will say I don’t think I have ever seen him at his. He’s exactly as compassionate, patient, loving, and understanding as he seems. And I hate it . OK, I don’t hate it. But it can certainly drive you nuts sometimes when you’re as cynical as I am. If I weren’t me, I would politely excuse myself to make the most epic eye roll of all time if a woman talked to me about her significant other the way I just did to you.  Yet here I am! Next they asked me to write an essay. I was super into it, but then cringed every time I opened my laptop. Topics? I quickly realized I have truly talked about everything possible. I guess that’s the dilemma one faces when they…well…can’t shut up. I’ve been a chronic oversharer since birth. So I decided I’d talk about something no one really knows about me, mainly because I just learned about it myself. What is it? I’ll get there.  When Glamour first told me I was going to be on the cover, I was freaking thrilled . Seriously. As a longtime reader, I couldn’t believe it. I’d always assumed that wearing swimsuits (or half a swimsuit) or having the occasional nip slip (or bit slip) wouldn’t make me the go-to choice for a women’s magazine I not only love but respect.  But there’s one thing she hasn’t shared yet: After giving birth to her daughter, Luna, last April, Teigen developed postpartum depression, a condition affecting one in nine women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this exclusive essay for Glamour, she talks about her experience, why she kept it private, and how she’s doing now. And she is as raw and real as ever. Over to you, Chrissy.  What women love about Teigen is that she is, as she admits, “an open book.” She will show off a perfect seared duck breast—and tell you she accidentally sliced off her fingertip on a mandoline. Ask her about the wildest place she’s had sex? She’ll answer. (An airplane.) She approaches any topic with that same raw, real candor.  C hrissy Teigen, 31, is many things: a Sports Illustrated cover girl, a New York Times best-selling cookbook author, a host of the Emmy-nominated TV series Lip Sync Battle and the soon-to-be designer of a fashion line with Revolve. But she’s best known for what her husband, John Legend, calls her: “smart mouth.” She opines on everything from politics to stretch marks, 140 characters a time on Twitter. And her commentary is often so “you took the words out of my mouth!” that all you have to do is hit RT and add the word “PREACH.”  I couldn’t figure out why I was so unhappy. I blamed it on being tired and possibly growing out of the role: “Maybe I’m just not a goofy person anymore. Maybe I’m just supposed to be a mom.”  I would be in my dressing room, sitting in a robe, getting hair and makeup done, and a crew member would knock on the door and ask: “Chrissy, do you know the lyrics to this song?” And I would lose it. Or “Chrissy, do you like these cat ears, or these panda hands?” And I’d be like: “Whatever you want. I don’t care.” They would leave. My eyes would well up and I would burst into tears. My makeup artist would pat them dry and give me a few minutes.  But I was different than before. Getting out of bed to get to set on time was painful. My lower back throbbed; my ­shoulders—even my wrists—hurt. I didn’t have an appetite. I would go two days without a bite of food, and you know how big of a deal food is for me. One thing that really got me was just how short I was with people.  I went back to work on Lip Sync Battle in August, when Luna was four months. The show treated me incredibly well—they put a nursery in my dressing room and blew up photos of Luna and John and my family for my wall. When Luna was on set, they lowered the noise levels. They turned down the air so she wouldn’t be cold. Only the most gentle knocking on the door. Pump breaks. I mean, there was no better place to get to go back to work to.  After I had Luna, our home was under construction, so we lived in a rental home, then a hotel, and I blamed whatever stress or detachment or sadness I was feeling at that time on the fact that there were so many odd circumstances. I remember thinking: “Maybe I’ll feel better when we have a home.”  I had such a wonderful, energetic pregnancy. Luna sat inside me like a little cross-legged Buddha facing toward my back for nine months. I never saw her face in a sonogram, just her butt or the back of her feet. Every time we kinnnnd of saw a nose, she would quickly dodge, and I was left guessing again. John, my mom, and my sister were all in the delivery room. John was DJ-ing. Luna, fittingly, popped out to the song “Superfly.” The first lyric is “Darkest of night. With the moon shining bright.” I immediately put her on my chest. And she had a face! I was so happy. And exhausted.  I had everything I needed to be happy. And yet, for much of the last year, I felt unhappy. What basically everyone around me— but me—knew up until December was this: I have postpartum depression. How can I feel this way when everything is so great? I’ve had a hard time coming to terms with that, and I hesitated to even talk about this, as everything becomes such a “thing.” During pregnancy, what I thought were casual comments about IVF turned into headlines about me choosing the sex of my daughter. And I can already envision what will be said about me after this admission. But it’s such a major part of my life and so, so many other women’s lives. It would feel wrong to write anything else. So here goes.  And a year ago, in April, John and I started our family together. We had our daughter, Luna, who is perfect. She is somehow exactly me, exactly John, and exactly herself. I adore her.  When I wasn’t in the studio, I never left the house. I mean, never. Not even a tiptoe outside. I’d ask people who came inside why they were wet. Was it raining? How would I know—I had every shade closed. Most days were spent on the exact same spot on the couch and rarely would I muster up the energy to make it upstairs for bed. John would sleep on the couch with me, sometimes four nights in a row. I started keeping robes and comfy clothes in the pantry so I wouldn’t have to go upstairs when John went to work. There was a lot of spontaneous crying.  Anytime I was seen out, it was because I had already had work or a work event that day. Meaning I wouldn’t have to muster up the energy to take a shower, because it was already done. It became the same story every day: Unless I had work, John knew there was not a chance in hell we were going on a date, going to the store, going anywhere. I didn’t have the energy.  Before, when I entered a room I had a presence: head high, shoulders back, big smile. Suddenly I had become this person whose shoulders would cower underneath her chin. I would keep my hands on my belly and try to make myself as small as possible.  During that time my bones hurt to the core. I had to go to the hospital; the back pain was so overwhelming. I felt like I was in an episode of Grey’s Anatomy: These kids were around me, asking questions. Maybe it was a kidney infection? No one could figure it out. I saw rheumatoid doctors for the wrist pain; we thought it might be rheumatoid arthritis. I felt nauseated all the time, so I saw a GI doctor. I wondered: Am I making this all up? Is this pain even real anymore?  By December I had started my second cookbook. With the first, I was in the kitchen the whole time. I stirred every pot, tasted everything. Had genuine excitement for Every. Single. Recipe. This one came at the height of my losing my appetite, and the idea of having to test and taste recipes actually made me vomit. I was still on the couch a lot.  Before the holidays I went to my GP for a physical. John sat next to me. I looked at my doctor, and my eyes welled up because I was so tired of being in pain. Of sleeping on the couch. Of waking up throughout the night. Of throwing up. Of taking things out on the wrong people. Of not enjoying life. Of not seeing my friends. Of not having the energy to take my baby for a stroll. My doctor pulled out a book and started listing symptoms. And I was like, “Yep, yep, yep.” I got my diagnosis: postpartum depression and anxiety. (The anxiety explains some of my physical symptoms.)  I remember being so exhausted but happy to know that we could finally get on the path of getting better. John had that same excitement. I started taking an antidepressant, which helped. And I started sharing the news with friends and family—I felt like everyone deserved an explanation, and I didn’t know how else to say it other than the only way I know: just saying it. It got easier and easier to say it aloud every time. (I still don’t really like to say, “I have postpartum depression,” because the word depression scares a lot of people. I often just call it “postpartum.” Maybe I should say it, though. Maybe it will lessen the stigma a bit.)  I wanted to write an open letter to friends and employers to explain why I had been so unhappy. The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain. To have people that you respect, who are the best in the business, witness you at your worst is tough. Even though this was something I shouldn’t have to apologize for, I did want to apologize. Because on a set, people depend on you. A lot of people are coming together and all you have to do, Christine , is put on a unicorn head and shoot a money gun. Editors are wondering what the f-ck happened to the girl they gave a book deal to. This shit was flying through my head and I felt horrible.  I actually did write my executive producer on Lip Sync Battle , Casey Patterson. She is one of the most amazing women in this universe and I never doubted she would understand. She told me she had noticed and was always here for me. I had to postpone my second cookbook, but my editor, Francis Lam, and publisher couldn’t have been more understanding. To go from discussing layouts and recipes and shoot days to a complete “off” switch was, I’m sure, not a great thing to hear. But, again, I cannot overstate how lucky I am to work with these people.  Before this, I had never, ever—in my whole entire life—had one person say to me: “I have postpartum depression.” Growing up in the nineties, I associated postpartum depression with Susan Smith [a woman now serving life in prison for killing her two sons; her lawyer argued that she suffered from a long history of depression], with people who didn’t like their babies or felt like they had to harm their children. I didn’t have anything remotely close to those feelings. I looked at Luna every day, amazed by her. So I didn’t think I had it.  I also just didn’t think it could happen to me . I have a great life. I have all the help I could need: John, my mother (who lives with us), a nanny. But postpartum does not discriminate. I couldn’t control it. And that’s part of the reason it took me so long to speak up: I felt selfish, icky, and weird saying aloud that I’m struggling. Sometimes I still do.  I know I might sound like a whiny, entitled girl. Plenty of people around the world in my situation have no help, no family, no access to medical care. I can’t imagine not being able to go to the doctors that I need. It’s hurtful to me to know that we have a president who wants to rip health care away from women. I look around every day and I don’t know how people do it. I’ve never had more respect for mothers, especially mothers with postpartum depression.  I’m speaking up now because I want people to know it can happen to anybody and I don’t want people who have it to feel embarrassed or to feel alone. I also don’t want to pretend like I know everything about postpartum depression, because it can be different for everybody. But one thing I do know is that—for me—just merely being open about it helps. This has become my open letter.  As I’m writing this, in February, I am a much different human than I was even just in December. I’m over a month into taking my antidepressant, and I just got the name of a therapist who I am planning to start seeing. Let’s be honest though—I probably needed therapy way before Luna!  Like anyone, with PPD or without, I have really good days and bad days. I will say, though, right now, all of the really bad days—the days that used to be all my days—are gone.  There are weeks when I still don’t leave the house for days; then I’m randomly at the Super Bowl or Grammys. (This is cringeworthily unrelatable, and I am very aware of that—it’s giving me anxiety.) Physically, I still don’t have energy for a lot of things, but a lot of new moms deal with this. Just crawling around with Luna can be hard. My back pain has gotten better, but my hands and wrists still hurt. And it can still be tough for me to stomach food some days. But I’m dealing.  I’m grateful for the people around me. John has been incredible over the last nine months, bringing me my medicine and watching horrible reality TV with me. He is not the goofiest guy, but he has gone out of his way to indulge my sense of humor. When I was having a good day, he would go to Medieval Times with me and put on the crazy period hat! He sees how much my eyes light up when he does that stuff, and he knows that’s what I need. I know he must look over at times and think: My God, get it together. But he has never made me feel that way. He wants me to be happy, silly, and energetic again, but he’s not making me feel bad when I’m not in that place. I love John and Luna more than I can imagine loving anything, and John and I still hope to give Luna a few siblings. Postpartum hasn’t changed that.  More than anything, I always want to have enough energy for Luna—to run up the stairs with her, to have tea parties with her. As she gets older, she’s becoming more and more fun. Her eyes are getting so wide, and I want to be there for those wide eyes. And I will be.  Phew! I’ve hated hiding this from you.

"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also"	1

Let Zayn entertain you! The singer gets frisky with a stripper in his new video for ‘Entertainer!’ Watch here!  Zayn Mailk and model Sofia Jamora are at it again in his latest music video for “Entertainer.” In it, Sofia is seen rocking a blonde wig, which gives her more Kylie Jenner vibes than Gigi Hadid, but she’s in the dressing room of a strip club while Zayn walks the streets smoking a cig. The vid is a continuation of his last hit, “Let Me,” in which Zayn is essentially in Scarface and he and Sofia escape the bad guys on a boat. This time, Zayn enters the club and sees his love interest, while singing, “Guess you didn’t know that you were my favorite entertainer, I watch you, laugh with and f–k with you. Don’t you take me for a fool. In this game, I own the rules.” Damn.  As a bleach blonde Zayn spots Sofia, he has flashbacks to their “Let Me” rendezvous. Once Sofia starts dancing on him, he recalls their hotel hook up and we’re not gonna lie, it’s super hot. Sofia the stripper keeps looking up at a camera, recording she and Zayn in the club, and tell him she’ll BRB. Except Zayn flashes back again to Sofia leaving him in the hotel room and disappearing without a trace. She does it again, this time in the club, and leaves a hopeless Zayn alone once more. He sees her take off in a black car and watches her go.  The final scene shows Zayn standing alone on a dock with a suitcase, clearly ready for his next adventure. This time, there is no “To be continued…” We can’t help but wonder, was this a message to Gigi after she broke up with him? “Thought that you were smarter, I’m ashamed for you. I knew it right away when you stopped lovin’ me. It happened when your touch wasn’t enough for me,” the former One Directioner sings. Well, luckily, we know he got the girl again in reality, as he and Gigi have been spotted together since announcing their break-up. Fingers crossed!	0

Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.	1

As Kylie Jenner’s feud with Wendy Williams rages on, Travis Scott is helping Kylie in the best way! Here’s how he’s supporting her amidst Wendy’s continuous disses!  Kylie Jenner, 20, is basking in the joy of being a new mother, but when she hears about Wendy Williams, 53, and her constant verbal attacks on her relationship with Travis Scott, 25, it’s hard not to get a bit frustrated. Wendy has stood by her prediction that Travis will eventually leave Kylie and the baby to live the partying lifestyle of a successful rapper. Before baby Stormi Webster was born on February 1, Wendy predicted that Travis would leave Kylie to raise the baby on her own. However, Travis hasn’t done that, and he doesn’t plan to, a source tells HollywoodLife.com. He’s sticking by Kylie’s side, and proving Wendy wrong.  “Kylie is getting the last laugh in her feud with Wendy Williams thanks to Travis,” the insider says. “Kylie’s not being petty and dwelling on it but yes, she’s pretty thrilled that Travis is proving Wendy and all the haters wrong. Don’t forget, Wendy said some pretty nasty things about how Travis was going to abandon Kylie and Stormi and that has not been the case at all.” Instead, it’s been the compete opposite. “He’s been so solid,” the source continues, adding that Travis is “the best dad and Kylie could not be happier. — She’s falling more in love with him every day.”  Throughout Kylie’s pregnancy, Wendy taunted the young star on her show. She remained adamant about her opinion that Kylie would be a single mother, even before giving birth. “At 20-years-old being pregnant, and I don’t care how much money you have, it’s got to be hard,” the talk show host said on her January 24 show. “The next reality show in the works right now might be, I got a name for you, ‘Kylie Goes It Alone’ because Travis Scott is not sticking around,” she proclaimed while laughing at a photo of the rapper. “Anyway, he’s not sticking around,” she said, once again.  Nonetheless, the couple is still going strong. In fact, Kylie and Travis celebrated Stormi’s one-month birthday on March 1, with both parents gushing over their bundle of joy on social media. First, Kylie took to Snapchat to show off the massive bouquets of pink flowers Travis had sent her in honor of Stormi’s one month in their lives. Then, both parents showed off photos of Stormi — the most we’ve seen of the little one — despite hiding her face in the snaps. Kylie also showed off her 4-week post-baby boy, aka her flat abs, on Snapchat.  Kylie and Travis welcomed a healthy baby girl, Stormi — who was 8 pounds, 9 ounces — at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 1. Kylie didn’t reveal she was pregnant or that she gave birth until February 4 when she released an 11-minute video with never-before-seen footage from her entire pregnancy. Since then, she’s returned to her normal social media use after taking a 9-month hiatus from the spotlight to enjoy her pregnancy in private. The news of Kylie’s pregnancy broke in September 2017.	1
Melissa Etheridge — a passionate advocate for medical marijuana — was busted for drug possession in August.  The 56-year-old singer was returning to the United States from Canada in North Dakota when her tour bus was reportedly stopped by Customs and Border Patrol. After drug-sniffing dogs detected the substance, agents discovered marijuana oil, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Etheridge told police that she uses the drug to manage pain from cancer. Although the drug is legal in California, however, it’s not allowed in North Dakota, said TMZ.  The “Come to My Window” crooner was reportedly booked for possession of a controlled substance and smiled from ear-to-ear in her mugshot, which was obtained by TMZ. According to the outlet, she pleaded not guilty. PEOPLE’s requests for comment were not immediately returned by CBP or a rep for Etheridge.  Etheridge first opened up about her weed use in the new Yahoo! project Cannabis & the American Family, and PEOPLE premiered the video clip earlier this year. The Grammy-winner explained that she began using medical marijuana as a holistic alternative to pharmaceuticals when she was undergoing chemotherapy after her 2004 breast cancer diagnosis.  During the initial interview, she added that she has smoked with her wife, Linda Wallem, and two older kids: Bailey, 20, and Beckett, 18. “It’s a very natural, end-of-the-day [thing],” she told Yahoo! “And it brings you much closer. I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink — oh, God, no.”  Since her quotes made the rounds online, Etheridge said she’s received flak for her parenting style and would hope the attention would be directed to a more important issue.  RELATED VIDEO: Melissa Etheridge’s Music Room Is the Coolest  Etheridge later clarified her comments exclusively to PEOPLE.  “I’ve been a celebrity here for almost 30 years, and I’ve done my best to speak truthfully about who I am and my human experience as I go through life, from my work to my family,” the rocker said. “Sometimes I find that I can say something, thinking that the whole world will understand, and they kind of go in another direction. I think if I get a little more specific, it can help guide the conversation in general about cannabis.”  Etheridge discussed why she believes her use of cannabis with her children has been “demonized” — and opened up about how heartbroken she was over the backlash she received for smoking with her kids.  “My children are my priority,” said Etheridge, who is also mom to 10-year-old twin daughters Johnnie Rose and Miller Steven. “I love my children. They are four of the most amazing human beings on earth. I live a very blessed life. I would never want to harm any of them.”	0

Prior to being asked to audition, Jones had criticized the show, saying that the show, and especially cast member Kenan Thompson, was ""not funny"".[13] Sasheer Zamata was added as a featured player, while Jones and LaKendra Tookes were hired as writers.[14] Jones appeared during the Weekend Update segment of the May 3, 2014 episode hosted by Andrew Garfield, where her jokes about her current dating problems and her potential effectiveness as a breeding slave were met with controversy.[6][15]  Jones appeared in the first and third episodes of the 40th season, hosted by Chris Pratt and Bill Hader, respectively. On October 20, 2014, Jones was promoted to the cast as a featured player, and made her official debut on the October 25, 2014 episode hosted by Jim Carrey. She became, at the age of 47, the oldest person to join the show as a cast member (surpassing Michael McKean and George Coe, who were 46 when they joined the show in, respectively, 1994 and 1975).[16][17] Jones' addition marks the first time in SNL history that the show's cast has included more than one African-American woman; in addition, the 40th season has the most African-American cast members to date.[18] Jones subsequently returned for Seasons 41, 42, and 43.  In 2017 and 2018, Jones was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on SNL.  Film [ edit ]  In 2006, Jones appeared in Master P's movie Repos.  In 2014, Jones appeared in Chris Rock's directing debut, Top Five; Rock has said a follow-up is in the works,[19] telling Complex Magazine, ""Some people really shine in Top Five. You might want to see a little more Leslie Jones.""[20]  In 2015, Jones appeared in the Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer project, Trainwreck; reportedly Apatow and Schumer wrote a part specifically for Jones after seeing her turn in Top Five.[21]  In 2016, she starred in the reboot Ghostbusters as Patty Tolan, alongside Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate McKinnon.[6][22]  Olympics [ edit ]  During the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Jones drew attention on social media and in the press as a Team USA ""superfan"",[23] regularly live-tweeting events and posting videos of her reactions.[24] Enthusiasm for Jones's commentary grew, with articles appearing like The Huffington Post's ""Watching Leslie Jones Watch The Olympics Is Better Than The Actual Olympics"".[25] Television producer Mike Shoemaker, one of Jones's Twitter followers, posted on Twitter that his friend Jim Bell, NBC's executive producer of the network's Olympics coverage, should add Jones to NBC's team of commentators covering the Games; Bell responded on Twitter the next day asking Jones to join NBC in Rio. She accepted and flew to Rio, covering swimming, track and field, gymnastics, and beach volleyball for NBC.[26]  Jones reprised her duties at the 2018 Winter Olympics.[27]  Other projects [ edit ]  Jones and fellow comedian Adam DeVine appeared in a 2016 ad campaign for Allstate Insurance, created by Leo Burnett Worldwide.[28]  Jones hosted the BET Awards on June 25, 2017.[29] This marked her hosting debut.  In 2018, Jones appeared in two advertisements for Amazon's Echo Spot.[30]  Sports fandom [ edit ]  Jones is a fan of the MLS team Seattle Sounders FC.[31]  Influences [ edit ]  Jones has cited as her comedic influences Eddie Murphy,[8] Richard Pryor,[4] Carol Burnett[32], Lucille Ball[32], John Ritter,[32] and Whoopi Goldberg.[4]  Online attacks [ edit ]  Following the release of Ghostbusters, Jones became the target of numerous accounts on social networking site Twitter making racially charged attacks. Twitter responded by taking action against several users, resulting in the permanent Twitter suspension of user and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who had described her as ""barely literate"".[33]  After continuing to receive racial comments towards her, Jones announced that she would be leaving Twitter on July 18, 2016.[34] Jones appeared later in the week on Late Night with Seth Meyers, in which she described the ordeal and her meeting with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Responding to Yiannopoulos's claim that he was targeted for being a ""gay conservative"", Jones stated, ""Free speech and hate speech [are] two different things"".[35]  Nearly a month later, Jones was again the subject of numerous online attacks. Her personal website was hacked, with its contents being replaced by photos of her driver's license and passport.[36] The site was also made to display alleged nude photographs of Jones, as well as a video tribute to Harambe, the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla killed in May 2016 (a reference to the racially charged gorilla remarks directed at Jones in the earlier attack). Jones' team took the website down shortly after it was hacked.[37]  Both incidents resulted in large outpourings of celebrity and fan support, via the hashtag ""#LoveForLeslieJ"", which trended on both Twitter and Instagram.[38] Paul Feig,[39] Gabourey Sidibe, Ellen DeGeneres, Sara Benincasa, Ava DuVernay, Hillary Clinton, Corey Taylor,[40] Katy Perry, Octavia Spencer, Anna Kendrick, Lena Dunham[41] and Loni Love expressed solidarity with Jones. Jones responded to the hacks on the October 22, 2016, episode of Saturday Night Live.[42]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]"	1

Amy Schumer has parted ways with Sony’s live-action “Barbie” over a scheduling conflict, Variety has learned.  “Sadly, I’m no longer able to commit to Barbie due to scheduling conflicts,” the actress said in a statement to Variety. “The film has so much promise, and Sony and Mattel have been great partners. I’m bummed, but look forward to seeing Barbie on the big screen.”  The big screen adaptation of Mattel’s iconic toy line was expected to start production this summer on June 23, but Schumer’s busy schedule includes a lengthy promotional tour for her new Fox comedy “Snatched,” which opens in May, as well as an upcoming shoot for Rebecca Miller’s “She Came to Me” opposite Steve Carell.  Sony needed to stick to its June 29, 2018 release date since Mattel already has merchandise and product cycles in motion–shifting the production to accommodate Schumer would have put on a strain on other partners on the film, according to insiders.  “We respect and support Amy’s decision,” a spokesperson for Sony said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing Barbie to the world and sharing updates on casting and filmmakers soon.”  Sony is still trying to find a director for the comedy. The “Barbie” movie is said to be in the vein of “Splash”, “Enchanted” and “Big.” In it, the main character gets kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough and lands in a real-world adventure.  Schumer recently did a polish of the script. It’s unknown whether the same tone will be kept with the comedian no longer attached.  Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Amy Pascal are producing the film. Parkes and MacDonald initiated the original deal with Mattel in 2014.  Schumer can be seen next in the action-comedy “Snatched,” which opens on May 12, 2017, and also has “Thank You for Your Service” opening in October. She is repped by UTA, Carrie Byalick at B Company and Maverick Management.	1

For the uninitiated a midlife crisis is roughly defined as a transition of identity as you reach those awkward middle aged years. This period comes a close second in the awkwardness scale to adolescence - which, as you will all know, is very uncomfortable.  The midlife crisis can be clearly seen in former footballer and now semi-retired celebrity David Beckham, who appears to be tapping into his teenage spirit, growing his hair out and looking increasingly like Kurt Cobain.  It's all come to a head this week when Beckham posted pictures on Instagram of him indulging his childish fantasies by taking six days off to build a 4,000 piece Lego castle for his six year old daughter Harper.  Perhaps now, at the age of 42, he's no longer sure who he wants to be any more... but he's so devishly handsome that he seems to be getting away with it with absolute panache.  So, then, here are the seven signs that suggest David Beckham is in the grip of a midlife crisis.	1
"CLOSE Cardi B and Migos rapper Offset became engaged in a high-profile way — onstage at Power 99's Powerhouse concert in Philly Friday night!

Cardi B was surprised, excited and overwhelmed.  And she was also already married to Offset.  It turns out the rappers secretly tied the knot back in September. On Monday, Cardi confessed that the couple had said their vows before she started wearing a giant diamond engagement ring and revealed they were pregnant.

"The Bumble Bee tuna processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 15, 2012. (Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon — even in fatalities.San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that ""we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident.""

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are getting married one month from today.  Sorry, let us try that again, this time with the proper level of enthusiasm one should muster for such an announcement:  MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY ARE GETTING MARRIED ONE MONTH FROM TODAY! EEEEEEK!!!!  That's better, don't you think?  But even though one month is a very small period of time until the Royal Wedding bells ring, those close to Markle reportedly think it's not small enough.  They wish the wedding were taking place tomorrow.  Because then they'd only have 24 hour left to deal what one source is describing as the ultimate Bridezilla.  Yes, this source is looking at you, Meghan Markle.  “Meghan’s driving everyone crazy with her diva demands,” an insider tells Life & Style, adding of the bride-to-be:  “She’s a perfectionist, and she’s trying to control everything going on around her.”  This is the first time we've heard of Markle being described as basically anything other than kind, generous, loyal, lovely and loving.  Aside from those racist trolls who gave Meghan and Harry problems early on in their romance due to the former's mixed heritage, Markle has received nothing but positive reviews for over a year now.  Everyone seems to adore her!  But weddings do have a way of causing such stress and tension for those prominently involved that it's nearly impossible not to snap on occasion.  And those are just regular weddings; with, like 75 to 100 guests.  Markle and Harry will be getting married in front of thousands of people lining the London streets, as well as millions more watching from home.  According to this tabloid source, the former Suits actress feels a lot of pressure to follow “the rules of royal etiquette” on her big day, but is also “worried about her family being on their best behavior.”  This last part is a bit unusual, however, because we're under the impression that almost no one from Markle's family is invited.  Just last week, Markle's controversial half-sister spoke out and complained about her lack of a wedding invite.  ""Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to Family,"" Samanha Grant Tweeted about her snub, attempting to shame Markle into extending the invite.  So far, though, it has failed to work.  It is expected that Markle's parents will be in attendance, with her mom actually walking her down the aisle instead of her dad.  This is because Thomas Markle is famously shy.  He and Meghan's mother split a long time ago and Thomas now lives a very quiet life in Mexico. Sources have told The Sun that he's afraid to face the ""world’s glare"" on May 19.  But face it he will, at least in some capacity.  Just like those complaining about Markle's recent behavior, we're guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.  What about YOU?  Are you sick of all this Royal coverage?  Or do you wish there was even more of it?"	1

Keep your mouth closed, no hoes, no bitches, no nothing, ’cause I’m pulling up.”  When asked about the age difference between the two — Rose is 33 and Savage is 24 — the rapper said he was only younger “in age, not mentally.”  But that being said, he’s still learning a few things from her.  “She makes me do s— that I don’t normally do,” he explained. “Like take vitamins and drink water.”  FROM PEN: Wendy Williams’ Perfect Date Night Might Not Be What You Expect  Most recently, Rose was linked to Dancing with the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy.

Over the past week, Cambridge-born-and-bred actor Matt Damon has found himself at the center of the #MeToo sexual harassment controversy.  Over the past week, Cambridge-born-and-bred actor Matt Damon has found himself at the center of the #MeToo sexual harassment controversy after giving two interviews on the subject. Here’s a look at what he said, and what the response has been.  Dec. 12: Matt Damon’s ABC News interview  Damon first faced criticism in response to an ABC News interview that aired last Tuesday. Damon spoke with film critic Peter Travers about several men who are facing sexual assault and harassment allegations, including film executive Harvey Weinstein, US Senator Al Franken, and comedian Louis C.K.  In an interview on “Popcorn with Peter Travers,” Damon said that we are living in a “culture of outrage” and that these recent allegations of sexual misconduct need to be analyzed on a spectrum.  Advertisement  “There’s a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,” Damon said. “Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”  Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here  Damon said it’s been a “watershed moment” that women have felt empowered to share their stories and hold men accountable for sexual misconduct. He also said people should try to be optimistic about the state of the movie business and of men overall.  “This [is] like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers,” Damon said. “It’s not everybody. It just feels like it.”  Dec. 15: The response  Damon’s interview was met with criticism, including from actresses Alyssa Milano and Minnie Driver.  Driver, Damon’s ex-girlfriend and “Good Will Hunting” co-star, responded to Damon’s comments in a series of tweets on Friday afternoon.  Gosh it?s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women?s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising) — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017  Advertisement  Milano, who worked with Damon in “Glory Daze” in 1995, responded to Damon’s comments in a Twitter thread last Friday night that began, “Dear Matt Damon, it’s the micro that makes the macro.”  Dear Matt Damon,    It?s the micro that makes the macro.    (Thread) — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  We are in a ?culture of outrage? because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted--even welcomed-- misogyny. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  Milano went on to compare Damon’s spectrum philosophy to the spectrum of cancer.  We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it?s still cancer. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  Sexual harassment, misconduct, assault and violence is a systemic disease. The tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers. #MeToo — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  Dec. 17: Minnie Driver continues her criticism  In an interview with The Guardian published Sunday, Driver expanded on her reaction.  “I felt I desperately needed to say something,” Driver told the publication. “I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.”  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse,” Driver continued. “A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  I don?t just speak for myself in this article, I speak for too many friends and co-workers as well. - Minnie Driver: men like Matt Damon 'simply cannot understand what abuse is like' https://t.co/Z9M120C6XZ — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 17, 2017  Advertisement  “How about: it’s all f****** wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not,” Driver continued. “Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.”  Dec. 18: Damon speaks with Business Insider  Damon continued defending men in the entertainment industry in a Monday interview with Business Insider. He said more attention should be focused on the men who don’t commit acts of sexual misconduct.  “We’re in this watershed moment, and it’s great, but I think one thing that’s not being talked about is there are a whole s---load of guys — the preponderance of men I’ve worked with — who don’t do this kind of thing and whose lives aren’t going to be affected,” Damon said.  Dec. 19: The response  Damon was called out on Twitter yet again by various Hollywood figures, including actresses Rose McGowan and Debra Messing.  Matt Damon is dense AF https://t.co/B9OKeh1WpG — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) December 18, 2017  Matt Damon- SERIOUSLY? You are a smart man. A privileged, white man.

John Cena and Nikki Bella had a lot of ups and downs in their six-year relationship, one of which was the time Bella revealed that she had been married before she met Cena.  The secret was one of the biggest plot points of Total Divas season 2, which aired in 2014.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  By that point, Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, had been dating for two years. She was even living with him, having signed his 75-page cohabitation agreement that forces her to move out all her belongings “as soon as possible” upon their separation.  But Bella was still hiding her past nuptials. And it turns out, it was not just from Cena.  During an emotional sit-down captured on camera, Bella told her family about her wedding for the first time — explaining to mom Kathy Colace, brother JJ Garcia and twin sister Brie (among others) that she was ashamed of her decision.  “I got married when I was 20. And got divorced at 23, to my high school sweetheart,” Bella said. “Basically we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it.”  The union was something Bella regretted from the beginning. “Even when I started walking down the aisle, I knew this was a huge mistake and how can I get out of it and I couldn’t,” she recalled. “I tried to forget about it but now it’s starting to come up, and I figured you guys have to hear from me before you hear from anyone else. It’s crazy ’cause John doesn’t even know and here we talk about marriage and we never bring it up.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Her family were not happy, especially Colace, who wondered why Bella didn’t think she could come to her.  But it was Garcia who showed the most anger, some of which was on behalf of Cena.  “John’s gonna be pissed. I’d be pissed for him if you hadn’t told him. ‘Cause you talk about marriage all the time with him, don’t expect it to be easy,” Garcia said. “[These things] really don’t just happen. You don’t just run off and get married and not tell your family for 10 years. That doesn’t just happen. You do what you got to do and I hope you figure it all out with John.”  It was Garcia who would accidentally spill the beans about the secret nuptial to Cena first, mentioning it at sister Brie’s 2014 wedding to her husband Daniel Bryan.  “I heard you’re handling everything awesome,” he told Cena. “For her to tell you that she’s been married before and you had no problem with it, I have to give you kudos man.  Cena look flabbergasted but kept the conversation moving.  Later, Bella finally got the courage to say something to Cena herself.  Luckily, having gone through a divorce (to ex-wife Elizabeth Huberdeau in 2012 after three years of marriage), Cena was more understanding than anything. Still, as the two had been fighting about marriage — with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again — he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him.  “When the focus of most of our problems has to do with that particular topic, maybe I should know that stuff,” he told Bella. “I know how you feel. You’re a human being, so I know you want certain things. But I would especially know how you feel about it because you had a bad experience.”  “I don’t care,” Cena added. “What you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don’t need to know everything about you. It’s just when you can tell other people and I kind of would like to be on that totem pole somewhere — I don’t have to be at the top … I just would like to be on it.”  Gary Miller/FilmMagic  Bella look relieved, though she said she did “feel bad” she didn’t tell Cena.  “I’ve realized that I need to start having confidence in my relationship with John and that he accepts me for all my faults,” she told the camera. “I am so relieved that John and I have made up and I’m just happy to be here with my family… honestly, nothing can go wrong now. Everything is perfect.”  RELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella End Engagement Weeks Before Destination Wedding  Cena and Nikki announced that they called off their engagement Sunday, a year after he proposed during WrestleMania 33.

Jennifer Garner confronted Ben Affleck‘s girlfriend Lindsay Shookus in person after she found out about their affair in 2015, sources tell PEOPLE.  Garner was on a work trip to New York City when she approached Shookus about the fling. “Lindsay refused to back down or quit the affair,” says a source.    Responds a source close to Shookus: “Jennifer and Lindsay do not have any relationship.”  Multiple sources have told PEOPLE that Affleck and Shookus started having an affair in 2013, two years before the actor and Garner announced their separation. Shookus was also still with her husband Kevin Miller, then a fellow SNL producer. The two split in 2014.  However, other sources close to Affleck and Shookus maintain that the two were just friends and didn’t date before their respective separations.  Sources also say Garner spoke to Shookus’ ex about the affair. After appearing on an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Miller is now a supervising producer, Garner sought him out for a conversation.  The first source says she showed him text messages between Affleck and Shookus, adding, “she had proof.” (Miller and Shookus were already split at the time.)  Affleck and Shookus have been spending time together in L.A. since going public with their relationship last week.  For much more on Affleck and Shookus, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  RELATED VIDEO: Ben Affleck Reportedly Dating SNL Producer Lindsay Shookus  Affleck and Garner announced their separation in 2015 after over a decade of marriage and filed for divorce this past April. They have continued to closely co-parent their three children — Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.  “Ben and Jen continue to be dedicated to their family and kids,” says a source who knows Affleck and Garner. “They have been separated for two years now and have never strayed from that dedication. They do it better than anyone.”  Shookus married Kevin Miller in 2010 and the two share a daughter. “They’re both really good friends still,” says a source close to the situation. “They’re both good, devoted parents. Lindsay and Kevin’s marriage didn’t end over infidelity. There were issues they couldn’t resolve and they realized they were better as friends than together.”  Garner is handling her ex’s public relationship fine, sources have said. “Nothing is new for her here,” says one insider. “She’s in mama-bear mode.”	1
Demi Lovato has been brutally honest about her battles with addiction, eating disorders and bipolar disorder, and recently, she celebrated her sixth year of sober living.  Speaking with Dr. Phil in an interview that aired Tuesday, the Grammy-nominated singer, 25, reflected back on her struggles and revealed her darkest days first came about as young as 7 years old.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “The very first time that I was suicidal was when I was 7, and I had this fascination with death,” Lovato said. “I have experienced things that I’ve not talked about and that I don’t know if I ever will talk about. But at 7, I knew that if I were to take my own life that the pain would end.”  Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 18 and bullied at age 12, Lovato turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the demons in her life.  “My addiction with drugs and alcohol was very severe to where I had several scares, and I knew that at the rate I was using and drinking, I wasn’t going to live a long life. I used very fast, very hard,” she said.

Don’t hold it inside — don’t isolate. Reach out to people, whether it’s close friends, family,” she advised. “If you feel like you don’t have anybody, look within yourself and try to find that resilience that will ultimately get you through whatever it is you’re going through.

Gossip Cop today debunked a tabloid cover story claiming that Megyn Kelly is replacing Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.  In Touch’s latest cover features a headline screaming “Shakeup At The ‘Today Show’: Matt Replaced By Megyn,” along with a dubious story alleging betrayal and backstabbing between the two television heavy-hitters.  Yet the piece “appears to be wholly manufactured by the publication,” according to Mediaite‘s sister site Gossip Cop.  What’s more, the tabloid offers up some fairly outrageous evidence to support its story, claiming Kelly showed up Lauer by nabbing a joint interview with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It’s fairly safe to assume Trump will not be joining Putin on a love seat for for a tell-all with Megyn Kelly anytime soon, as much as we would like to will that into existence.  Lauer, Gossip Cop reports, will continue to be the face of Today and a key fixture at NBC News despite the arrival of Kelly, which is currently slated for June.  From the report:  The notion that Lauer has been “replaced,” says an extremely well-placed NBC News insider, is “totally false.” And as for the contention that there will be a joint Putin and Trump interview, and that it will be conducted by Kelly, our impeccable source calls it “laughable.”  In Touch has published a number of demonstrably false stories touting a feud between Lauer and Kelly, including another cover story from February alleging Lauer was going to be “dumped” at the Today show in favor of the former Fox News star.  Last September, when she was still at Fox, Kelly––who said she’s friends with Lauer and respects him a lot––defended him after he got criticism in the liberal media for not being tough enough on Donald Trump during that NBC News presidential forum.

Diagnosis  There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.  Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors — can also cause facial muscle weakness, mimicking Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:  Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.  This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.  Treatment  Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.  Medications  Commonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.  such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.  Physical therapy  Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.  Surgery  In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.  Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems.  Lifestyle and home remedies  Home treatment may include:  Protecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.

Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.  Alternative medicine  Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine for people with Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following:  Acupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief.

Write down questions you want to ask your doctor.  Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For Bell's palsy, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:  What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?  Are there any other possible causes for my symptoms?  What kinds of tests do I need?  Is this condition likely temporary or long lasting?  What treatments are available for Bell's palsy? Which do you recommend?  Are there alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?  I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?  Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?  Don't hesitate to ask any additional questions that occur to you during your appointment.  What to expect from your doctor  Be prepared to answer questions from your doctor, such as:  When did you begin having symptoms?  Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?  How severe are your symptoms?  What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?  What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?  Have any of your relatives ever had Bell's palsy or problems with facial paralysis?  Have you had any symptoms of a more generalized infection?  What you can do in the meantime  If you have facial pain:  Take over-the-counter pain relievers. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can help with pain.

Kanye West has reportedly settled his $10 million lawsuit against insurance company Lloyd’s of London over canceling his Saint Pablo tour in 2016. The cancellation occurred shortly before the rapper’s subsequent hospitalization for exhaustion.  According to TMZ, the insurance company has agreed to pay the majority of the 40-year-old’s claim. Representatives for the rapper have yet to respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  West originally filed the lawsuit in August of 2017, about eight months after canceling the tour dates, claiming the insurance company had stalled on paying out the “multi-million dollar claim” stemming from the canceled concerts.  According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE at the time, West’s lawyers claimed that the insurers made their client go to great lengths to prove his mental breakdown was legitimate and that they were hunting “for some contrived excuse not to pay.”  “Nor have they provided anything approaching a coherent explanation about why they have not paid, or any indication if they will ever pay or even make a coverage decision, implying that Kanye’s use of marijuana may provide them with a basis to deny the claim and retain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in insurance premiums,” stated West’s team in the filing.  RELATED VIDEO: Kanye Was Unable to ‘Snap Back’ from Erratic Episodes Without Kim by His Side: Source  Lloyd’s of London later hit back with a countersuit claiming they were not liable and had “no duty” to pay the sum.  According to court documents filed in August of 2017 and obtained by PEOPLE at the time, syndicates of Lloyd’s of London addressed several insurance policy exclusions relating to a preexisting physical or psychological condition, possession of illegal drugs, prescription drugs not taken as medically prescribed, and the consumption of alcohol rendering the insured unfit to “perform contracted duties.”  Although the insurance company chose not to reveal what they found “in order to protect the privacy of Mr. West from public disclosure of details of his private life,” they were seeking declaratory relief that they “have no duty to indemnify” West’s company, Very Good Touring, Inc.	0
An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is “rigged.”Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an “gangland-style execution”, hours after blowing the whistle on the “rigged Super Bowl” backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League’s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday’s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.However Goodes went “off-script” in Minneapolis and was “physically removed” from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as “totally corrupt” and claiming the Super Bowl is “fixed.”Telling reporters that he is a “football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second”, Goodes said “Football in America in 2018 doesn’t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.“Football in America won’t recover from this.”Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.““You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed?“Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? I’m telling you now, they don’t care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes?”“The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes.”“How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games?”“Everyone is on the same side, that’s why.”“These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They can’t open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast.”Why doesn’t anyone speak out?According to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear.“Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed.“It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl.”“And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. “We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We’re exempt.”Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.	1

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston 's dance-off at this year's Met Ball, while she was still publicly dating Calvin Harris has taken on a whole new significance following the pictures of the pair kissing.  The Shake It Off star, 26, was caught in a passionate embrace with the Night Manager actor, 35, near her Rhode Island home in photos that emerged last night, just two weeks after it was confirmed she had split from the Scottish DJ after a 15 month romance.  Four weeks before the break-up and Swift and Hiddleston had put on a VERY flirty display as they hit the dancefloor at the Met Ball where Taylor was on co-hosting duties with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.  (Image: Instagram)  (Image: Instagram)  Videos from the night - that Calvin was noticeably absent from - show the pair throwing shapes to Beyonce's Crazy In Love and appear oblivious to anyone else around them.  The duo are known for loving a turn on the dancefloor - but was there more to it then just an innocent booty shake?  Insiders later admitted there was obvious ""chemistry"" between the couple and it's clear in the video that Taylor and Tom can barely tear their eyes each other as they gyrate along to the music.  Taylor even suggestively brushes past the actor as she carries on the dance session.  (Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)  According to The Sun Taylor had been ""won over"" by Hiddleston after the flirty dance-off, and while insiders claim he began ""pursuing"" her after they first met, they insisted that there was NO overlap with her romance with Calvin.  “Tom has been courting Taylor since they met – he sent her flowers. She’s been won over,"" a source told the paper.  “The timing of this looks very bad for Taylor. There was an obvious connection with Tom at the Met Gala – you can see that in the video of them dancing together.""  They continued: “Her people are insistent that no one else was involved in the split with Calvin, which is most likely the case.  “But it feels pretty disrespectful to be moving on to someone so public so quickly.”  Read more: Taylor Swift caught gazing at Tom Hiddleston while she was still with Calvin Harris after spending the evening together  (Image: REX)  The new couple also spent the night together before the gala event.  Both were guests at Anna Wintour's private dinner on the eve of the fashion bash, with Taylor spotted gazing at the actor in the hallway of the New York residence as he headed home with actor Idris Elba.

"Celebrity  The Oscar-winning actor reportedly 'has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag!'  Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor ""has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!""  The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""  ""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any ""federal attention."" A representative for the ""Ocean's Eleven"" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer ""is fabricated."""	1

Getty  Now, according to a report by In Touch, Brad has won a major victory in the wake of their bitter split.  After months of biding his time, Brad's waiting has finally paid off!  A source close to the actor told In Touch, 'Brad's finally got the kids, and he's overjoyed.  'To Brad's delight, Angelina has decided to let the majority of the children, who have summer camps and a slew of other activities in the works, stay in LA with their father while she's in Britain filming Maleficent 2.'  Brad was reportedly livid when Angelina told him she'd found a home in London to live in with all six children while she filmed the Disney sequel, 'but to keep him from fighting her on it,' a friend tells, 'she promised Brad that he could spend longer periods with their children.'  In Touch's report claims that's what their children want too.  RELATED:  The 54-year-old actor, 'couldn't be happier' according to In Touch, because now he knows he'll have his quality time with all six children.  In Touch's report further reveals Brad's already preparing his LA home.  'He gets such enjoyment out of seeing them cut loose at their amusement park-like former home,' the friend tells the publication. 'So, he's really spruced up the pool area, the skateboard ramp and the bike track.'  Spending time with his kids over the summer could give the actor the leverage he needs to get joint custody once and for all.  'He's been patient long enough,' says the friend. 'Something's got to give. Angelina can't control everything forever.'  Neither Brad or Angelina have responded to In Touch's report.	1
"2016 film directed by David Yates  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a 2016 fantasy film directed by David Yates. A joint British and American production, it is a spin-off and prequel to the Harry Potter film series, and is produced and written by J. K. Rowling in her screenwriting debut, inspired by her 2001 guide book of the same name. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Carmen Ejogo, and Colin Farrell. It is the first instalment in the Fantastic Beasts film series, and ninth overall in the Wizarding World franchise, that began with the Harry Potter films.  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them premiered in New York City on 10 November 2016 and was released worldwide on 18 November 2016 in 3D, IMAX 4K Laser and other large format cinemas. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $814 million worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2016.  The film was nominated for five BAFTAs, including Best British Film, winning Best Production Design, and was nominated for two Academy Awards, winning Best Costume Design, becoming the first Wizarding World film to win an Academy Award.[9] A sequel, titled Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released on 16 November 2018.[10]  Plot [ edit ]  In 1926, 65 years before the events of the first Harry Potter film, British wizard and ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander arrives in New York, en route to Arizona. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (""No-Maj"" or ""Muggle"") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speaking about witches and wizards being real and dangerous, a Niffler escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted Auror (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.  After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained Obscurus, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died, those afflicted rarely living past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing Senator Henry Shaw, Jr. Director of Magical Security Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death in secret, but Queenie and Jacob rescue them, and they escape after retrieving Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old goblin informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the escaped creatures.  Meanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, who he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.  Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle back into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society; however, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and framing Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks and begins to defeat all of them. After being subdued by one of Newt's beasts, he is revealed as Grindelwald in disguise and is taken into custody.  MACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion as rainfall over the city that erases all New Yorkers' recent memories as MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina when his book is finished; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of silver Occamy eggshells to fund his bakery. His breads and pastries are subconsciously inspired by Newt's creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop.  Cast [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them panel at the 2016 panel at the 2016 San Diego Comic Con International (left to right): director Yates; actors Redmayne, Waterston, Sudol, Fogler, Farrell, Miller.  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is mentioned several times as a school textbook in the Harry Potter book series, although Scamander himself does not appear in any of the books. In 2001, Rowling published an edition of the ""textbook"" to be sold to raise money for the British charity Comic Relief. The book is a directory of magical creatures written with an introduction by its author Newt Scamander; it does not contain a storyline narrative. (In literature, the creation of such a long work not part of a novel's narrative storyline is known as a false document.[29])  First announced in September 2013, the project marks Rowling's debut as a screenwriter.[30] The film sees the return of producer David Heyman, as well as writer Steve Kloves, both veterans of the Potter film franchise.[31] After Alfonso Cuarón declined involvement,[32][33] Warner Bros. announced that David Yates would direct at least the first instalment of a planned trilogy.[34] James Newton Howard was contracted to compose the score.[35]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography commenced on 17 August 2015, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and was completed in January 2016.[19][21][36][37] Several scenes were also shot on location in London.[38] After two months, the production moved to the Cunard Building and St George's Hall in Liverpool, which was transformed into 1920s New York City.[39] Framestore in London produced the visual effects for the film.[40]  Music [ edit ]  On 9 April 2016, it was announced that James Newton Howard would write and compose the film's score.[41] On 24 October, Pottermore published an official first look at the film's main theme composed by Howard.[42] The main theme incorporated John Williams' themes from earlier films, such as ""Hedwig's Theme"".[43] The soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music on 18 November 2016.[44]  Release [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them had its world premiere at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on 10 November 2016. The film was released worldwide on 18 November 2016, in 2D, 3D and the new IMAX 4K Laser system.[11][45] It would premiere one day earlier in a number of other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany and Italy, on 17 November. The film would be released in a total of 1,028 IMAX screens worldwide (388 screens in the United States and Canada, 347 screens in China, 26 screens in Japan and 267 screens in other countries). This marked the second time—after Doctor Strange—that a film secured a release in over 1,000 IMAX screens worldwide.[46][47]  Marketing [ edit ]  Publicity [ edit ]  On 4 November 2015, Entertainment Weekly released the first official publicity shots of the film, containing pictures of characters Newt, Tina, and Queenie, and production and filming being held in various sets designed to mirror 1920s New York City. On 10 December 2015, it was announced that an ""announcement trailer"" would be released five days later, on 15 December.[48] Along with the one-minute trailer, a teaser poster was released.[49][50]  During ""A Celebration of Harry Potter"" at Universal Orlando Resort in February 2016, a featurette was released showcasing several interviews with various cast and crew members, as well as the first official behind-the-scenes footage.[51] On 10 April 2016, the first ""teaser trailer"" was released during the MTV Movie Awards.[52] On 10 August, more information and publicity shots for the film were released through Entertainment Weekly, with new information on Ezra Miller's character Credence Barebone and the news that Zoë Kravitz would have a role in the series.[53][54] New images released include the quartet running down a New York City alleyway, David Yates chatting to stars Katherine Waterston and Eddie Redmayne on the set in front of a blown out subway station, Colin Farrell's character Percival Graves interrogating an arrested and handcuffed Newt, and Graves and Credence putting up anti-magic propaganda.[53][55]  Tie-in literature and merchandise [ edit ]  On 26 April 2016, it was announced that the film's script would be released in the form of a book on 19 November.[56] The book, titled Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay, was written by Rowling herself. In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the novelisation of the film was released on 19 November 2016, the day after the film's premiere.[57]  On 7 March 2016 a trailer-preview was released about the History of Magic in North America as it is in the Harry Potter universe.[58] On 7 October 2016, Rowling also released on Pottermore four pieces of writing exclusively as an introduction to the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, titled History of Magic in North America. It includes information about scourers in North America, brutal and violent magical mercenaries who played a significant role in the historic Salem witch trials of the 1600s, as well as info about various American wand makers; the role magic played in World War I; Native American magic; the foundation of MACUSA; the harsh enforcement No-Maj/Wizarding segregation; and life in 1920s Wizarding America; with info about wand permits and prohibition.[59][60]  On 28 June 2016, Rowling released a second part to her History of Magic in North America series, concerning the fictitious Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, detailing the founding of the pre-eminent American Wizarding academy and allowing users to sort themselves into one of the four houses of the school. The school itself is mentioned in the film.[61]  A ""story pack"" based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was released for the video game Lego Dimensions by WB Games and TT Games. The pack includes a constructible model of MACUSA, figures of Newt Scamander and a Niffler, and a six-level game campaign that adapts the film's events. The pack was released on the same day as the film, alongside a ""fun pack"" containing figures of Tina Goldstein and a Swooping Evil. The cast of the film reprises their roles in the game.[62]  Home media [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts was released on Digital HD on 7 March 2017, and on 4K UHD, 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on 28 March 2017.[63]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them grossed $234 million in the United States and Canada and $580 million in other countries for a total of $814 million.[8] The film was made on a budget of $180 million, with an additional $150 million spent on marketing.[6][64] Worldwide, the film grossed $219.9 million during its opening weekend from around 64 markets in 24,200 screens, both the fifth-biggest in Rowling's wizarding cinematic universe, and the seventh-biggest of the month of November.[7][65] IMAX totalled $15 million from 605 screens.[46] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $164 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the ninth-most profitable release of 2016.[66]  United Kingdom and Ireland [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts went on general release in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 18 November 2016. It debuted with £15.33 million ($19.15 million) from 666 cinemas, the biggest debut of any film in 2016, ahead of the previous record holder, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (£14.62 million).[46][67] The film was surpassed during the last days of 2016 by Rogue One: A Star Wars Story which gained over one million pounds.[68]  United States and Canada [ edit ]  In the United States and Canada, tracking had the film grossing $68–85 million in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $100 million. The film was released on 18 November in 4,143 cinemas, of which 388 were IMAX screens, and over 3,600 were showing the film in 3D.[69][70][71] It grossed $29.7 million on its first day, the second-lowest opening day among Rowling's adaptations (behind the $29.6 million Friday of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets).[72] This included $8.75 million it earned from Thursday night preview screenings beginning at 6 pm in 3,700 cinemas.[73] In total, the film earned $74.4 million in its opening weekend, falling in line with projections and finishing first at the box office, but recorded the lowest opening among Rowling's Harry Potter universe.[7][74] It made $8 million from 388 IMAX screens, $9 million from 500 premium large format locations and $1.75 million from Cinemark XD.[7]  The film's opening was considered a hit taking into account how the story was not based on a popular existing source, and the film itself was void of the franchise's main character, Harry Potter.[64] It was the top choice among moviegoers, representing 47% of the weekend's total $157.6 million tickets sales.[75] On its second Friday, it had a gradual drop of 37% ($18.5 million) from the week before, the second-best Friday drop for any Harry Potter film, behind The Philosopher's Stone. This was in part due to Black Friday, the most lucrative day of the Thanksgiving Day stretch.[76] It ended up grossing $45.1 million in its second weekend (a drop of just 39.4%), finishing 2nd at the box office behind newcomer Moana.[77]  Other markets [ edit ]  Outside North America, the film debuted day-and-date in 63 countries, along with its North American release, where it was projected to gross $90–125 million in its opening weekend.[78][79] It opened 16 November 2016 in 9 countries, earning $6.9 million from 5,070 screens.[80][81] It opened in 38 more countries on 18 November, earning $16.6 million for a total of $23.5 million in two days.[80] In three days, it made $53.6 million.[82] Through Sunday, 20 November, the film had a five-day opening weekend of $145.5 million from 63 countries, above the initial projections.[46] It earned another $132 million in its second weekend after a large debut in China and Japan.[47]  It recorded the biggest opening day of all-time among the Harry Potter franchise in Korea ($1.7 million), the Philippines ($1.2 million),[83] the UAE ($429,000) and Ukraine, the second biggest in Mexico ($1.8 million), Russia and the CIS ($1.7 million), Brazil ($1.3 million) and in Indonesia ($480,000), all behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 and the third biggest in the United Kingdom ($5.4 million), behind Part 1 and Part 2.[80] It also scored the second biggest Warner Bros. opening of all-time in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.[80] Notably, France opened with $1.8 million, Spain with $1.4 million, and Germany with $1 million ($2 million including paid previews).[80] In terms of opening weekend, the film posted the biggest opening among the Harry Potter franchise in 16 markets, including South Korea ($14.2 million, also the third-biggest opening for the studio), Russia ($9.8 million) and Brazil ($6.4 million), the biggest opener of the year in Germany ($10.2 million), Sweden, Belgium and Switzerland and the biggest Warner Bros. debut in those along with France ($10.2 million), Holland and Denmark. Italy debuted with $6.6 million, the biggest for a U.S. film in the country. Australia opened with $7.4 million, followed by Mexico ($5.8 million) and Spain ($4.5 million).[46]  It opened in China on 25 November alongside Disney's animated Moana but did not face significant competition from it. It earned $11.2 million on its opening day from 11,600 screens, the best among the Rowlings cinematic universe.[84][85] In total, it had an opening weekend of $41.1 million, dominating 60% of the top five films with 70,000 screenings per day. This alone surpassed the entire lifetime total of all Harry Potter films save the last one.[47][86] Similarly in Japan—typically the biggest or second biggest market for the previous Harry Potter films—it debuted with $15.5 million, besting the total lifetime of all the previous films except for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[47]  The film also set a number of IMAX records. In total, the opening weekend was worth $7 million from 276 screens, which is the second-highest ever in the Wizarding World, behind Deathly Hallows – Part 2. In 33 territories, it opened at number one. Moreover, it's also the third-highest-grossing November international IMAX opening ever, and the No. 1 start for IMAX in November in 19 countries including Japan ($1.1 million), the UK, Russia, Germany, and the Netherlands.[46] In China, it had the biggest IMAX opening among the franchise with $5.1 million from 347 IMAX screens.[47] Overall, the film has earned a global cumulative total of $19.1 million from the format.[47]  It has become the highest-grossing film in Rowling's cinematic universe in Russia ($16.7 million) and the second-highest in South Korea ($24.6 million). China ($41.1 million) the United Kingdom ($37.6 million), followed by Germany ($18.4 million), France ($16.7 million), and Spain ($13.3 million) are the film's biggest-earning markets.[47]  Critical response [ edit ]  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 309 critics and judged 74% of the reviews as positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them draws on Harry Potter's rich mythology to deliver a spinoff that dazzles with franchise-building magic all its own.""[87] Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, gives the film a score 66 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 90% positive score and a 74% ""definite recommend"".[7][89]  Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five out of five, hailing it as ""a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment"" and a ""terrifically good-natured, unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film"".[90] NME's Larry Bartleet also gave it five out of five, calling it ""more enchanting to your inner kid than the Potter films ever were"".[91] IndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ saying that it ""delivers the most satisfying period fantasy since Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street "", and that its layers of sophistication made it one of the best Hollywood blockbusters of the year.[92]  Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, writing ""Newt Scamander is nothing like Harry, but it has to be this way. It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us"".[93] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is ""likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them"".[94] However, New York Magazine's David Edelstein deemed the film a ""distinctly unmagical slog"", remarking that the beasts ""aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating"".[95] In a mixed review, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the film ""patchy but occasionally charming.""[96]  Accolades [ edit ]  Notes  Sequels [ edit ]  Initially, in October 2014, the studio announced the film would be the start of a trilogy.

First comes love, then comes marriage? No. First comes money, then comes marriage, according to a new report, which claims Rihanna and Hassan Jameel headed to the alter! But, they’re reportedly protecting their massive fortunes first.  The first sign of true love and trust is an iron-clad prenup, right? Well, according to a new report, both Rihanna, 29, and her new rumored boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, 29, are in the midst of planning a wedding! However, business is business. “Everything is moving so fast, but right now the priority is working out their individual assets with their attorneys in order to write up an ironclad contract,” a source tells Life & Style magazine. So, what numbers are we exactly working with, here? Rihanna and Hassan are reportedly hashing out a prenup worth more than $1 billion; you know, nine zeros…  “They’re crazy about each other, but they both know that a prenup is a good idea,” the insider says. So, here’s the alleged understanding — “Both parties agree that what they bring into the marriage, financially speaking, is what they’ll leave with.” Ultimately, Rihanna and Hassan have reportedly agreed to keep the contract as simple as possible. Basically a what’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is yours, type of situation; because, again, this is what love is all about.  Once the alleged prenup is dealt with, the couple reportedly plans to get married, outside of the U.S. “They want to exchange vows to be special to who they are and where they come from, which means Barbados for her and Saudi Arabia for him, probably in Riyadh,” the source says. And, get this — “Having two weddings is a big possibility.” Wow.  And, there’s no price tag too high for everlasting love. “They obviously aren’t concerned about money,” according to the mag. “What they both want is to be in a gorgeous location, surrounded by family and friends. They can’t wait to get married.” This is cute. However, neither Rihanna and Hassan have addressed the marriage reports. Not to mention, they don’t even have more than a few photos together at this point.  One person who did confirm their romance? — Rihanna’s father, Ronald Fenty. “She told me she had a new boyfriend. But, I didn’t know who he was,” Fenty tells the mag. And, he even offered up a stern warning to Ri’s new man. “He’s going to have to buckle up,” Ronald says, because Rihanna’s “very independent and ambitious. Nobody can tell her what to do.” Father knows best!  Rihanna and Hassan were first romantically linked on June 27, when they were spotted kissing in a private pool in Spain. The pair vacationed at an exclusive villa and looked smitten with each other in steamy, PDA photos. Rihanna’s romantic getaway was the first time she was spotted with a new man since she and Drake, 30, split in Oct. 2016.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Rihanna and Hassan are the real deal?	1
The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.	1
"Milena Markovna ""Mila"" Kunis (; born August 14, 1983) is an American actress. In 1991, at the age of seven, she moved from Soviet Ukraine to the United States with her family. After being enrolled in acting classes as an after-school activity, she was soon discovered by an agent. She appeared in several television series and commercials, before acquiring her first significant role at age 14, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series That '70s Show (1998–2006). Since 1999, she has voiced Meg Griffin on the animated series Family Guy.  Kunis' breakout film role came in 2008,[1][2] playing Rachel in the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She gained further critical acclaim and accolades for her performance in the psychological thriller Black Swan (2010), for which she received the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress, and nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other major films include the neo-noir action film Max Payne (2008), the post-apocalyptic action film The Book of Eli (2010), the romantic comedy film Friends with Benefits (2011), the comedy film Ted (2012), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the comedy film Bad Moms (2016).  Early life  Milena Markovna Kunis was born on August 14, 1983 in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.[3] Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver.[4] Kunis has an elder brother named Michael.[5][6] Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian.[7] She stated in 2011 that her parents had ""amazing jobs"", and that she ""was very lucky"" and the family was ""not poor""; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw ""no future"" there for Mila and her brother.[8] In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. ""That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.""[8]  Kunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15] She has stated that her parents ""raised [her] Jewish as much as they could"", although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union.[16][11] On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: ""I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States.""[17]  In Los Angeles, she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School.[18] She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That '70s Show.[19] She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School,[20] from which she graduated in 2001.[14] She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.[5][21]  Career  1994–2000: Career beginnings and television work  At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager.[22][23] On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial.[24] Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line.[25][26] Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on Days of Our Lives,[27][28] and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch.[29] She had a minor role on 7th Heaven[19] and supporting roles in Santa with Muscles, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, and the Angelina Jolie film Gia, as the young Gia Carangi.[5]  At the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly.[30] Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl.[20] In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role.[23] That '70s Show ran for eight seasons.[31] She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.[32]  In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy,[33] created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show.[34] When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[34] MacFarlane added: ""What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila – something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work.""[35] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007.[36] She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as ""the scapegoat.""[37]  2001–2008: Transition to film  In 2001, she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was poorly reviewed by critics,[38] and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film.[39] In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007.[40] Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes.[41] DVD talk concluded that ""fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place"".[42]  In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister, which was not released theatrically until 2007.[43] The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters.[44][45] She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in Get Over It.[46] In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled Straight Edge).[47] The film was not released in theatres in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.[48]  Max Payne premiere in 2008 Kunis at thepremiere in 2008  Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up,[2] entailed improvisation on her part.[49] The film garnered positive reviews,[50] and was a commercial success, grossing $105 million worldwide.[51] Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her ""fresh beauty and focused energy"",[52] while James Berardinelli wrote that she is ""adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing"".[53] She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award.[54] In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show.[2]  Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role.[55] Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide[56] but was poorly reviewed by critics,[57] with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast.[58][59] Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was ""horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss"".[60] Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, ""Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park.""[55] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.[61]  2009–2012: Film breakthrough and acclaim  In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews,[62] and grossed $10.8 million at the box office.[63] Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis ""brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility.""[64] Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: ""As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world.""[65] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: ""I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic."" Kunis herself stated that ""I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting.""[66]  In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews,[67] it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157 million worldwide.[68] Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a ""particularly strong piece of work"".[69] Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's ""ideally cast in the key female role""[70] Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that ""the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts"",[71] and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she ""generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing.""[72] Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that ""she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial"".[73][74][75] Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance.[76][77] Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell.[78] She garnered several positive reviews for her performance.[79][80][81] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it ""a shot in the arm.""[82]  Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman.[30][83] She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20 pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week.[1][84][85] During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder.[86] Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics[87] and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[88] The film grossed over $106.9 million in the United States and Canada[89] while grossing over $329 million worldwide.[90] Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive,[91][92][93] with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, ""Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness.""[94] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, ""it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness.""[95] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival,[96] and earned her Golden Globe Award[97] and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress.[98] At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.[99]  Kunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the 2011 romantic comedy Friends with Benefits.[100] Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind.[101] Friends with Benefits achieved success at the box office, grossing over $149 million worldwide,[102] and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake.[103] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that ""Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy"" and ""her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen"".[104]  In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her.[105] Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics[106] and was a commercial success, grossing $549 million worldwide.[107] Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis ""brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been 'the pushy girlfriend'"".[108]  2013–present: continued work  In 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures' prequel, Oz the Great and Powerful.[109][110] She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film.[111] The film, and Kunis's performance, received mixed reviews from critics.[112] Kim Newman of Empire Magazine wrote that Kunis ""walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle"".[113] In contrast, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Kunis's performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo.[114] Oz the Great and Powerful was a commercial success, grossing over $493 million worldwide.[115]  Also in 2013 Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller Blood Ties with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard.[116] The film premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and had a limited release in the United States in 2014.[117] Blood Ties received mixed reviews.[118] Kunis was also cast in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, alongside Robin Williams and Peter Dinklage.[119] The film had a limited theatrical and VOD release[120] and received poor reviews.[121] The Paul Haggis-directed film Third Person co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco[122] premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival[123] and had a limited release in 2014, but also received mostly negative reviews.[124] Kunis' performance was praised by some critics; Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her role gives her ""enormous room to express her talent"" and she ""gives her story a shot of raw intensity"".[125]  Kunis is set to be an executive producer for a feminist-themed TV series for the CW network. Meridian Hills, is a drama about the women's liberation movement in the 1970s. She will not appear on-screen.[126][127][128] In October 2014 it was announced Kunis, along with her partners, had launched a new production company called Orchard Farm Productions. The company has a first-look deal with ABC Studios, where the company is based. Under the agreement, the team will develop and produce TV projects for broadcast and cable.[129]  In 2015, Kunis co-starred with Channing Tatum in the science fiction film Jupiter Ascending, directed by the Wachowskis.[130][131] While the film grossed over $183.9 million on a $176 million budget,[132] it received mostly negative reviews, with a consensus that the production was ""narratively befuddled"" and a ""visually thrilling misfire"".[133]  Kunis co-starred with Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy Bad Moms, which was released July 29, 2016.[134] It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could ""take full advantage of its assets"".[135] Chris Nashawaty from Entertainment Weekly wrote that ""Kunis manages to be both sympathetic and funny, and she has crack comedic timing"".[136] The film went on to earn more than $183.9 million with a budget of $20 million.[137] Following the financial success of Bad Moms, STX Entertainment reunited Kunis with her co-stars Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn for a sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas, which was released on November 1, 2017.[138][139] It went on to receive mixed reviews[140] and gross over 130 million worldwide with a budget of $28 million.[141]  Kunis later co-starred with Kate McKinnon in the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me. The film was released on August 3, 2018.[142]  In the media  In 2007, Kunis participated in a video for the website Funny or Die appearing alongside James Franco. The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4 million views over the next ten years.[143] Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video.[144] In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's ""Shine Your Own Star"" Christmas campaign.[145]  In 2010, she was featured in the ""Women We Love"" segment in Esquire with an accompanied video.[146] Kunis was among several female stars photographed by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams in conjunction with the Calvin Klein Collections for a feature titled American Women 2010, with the proceeds from the photographs donated to the NYC AIDS foundation.[147] During the summer of 2010 Kunis served with Randy Jackson as the Master of Ceremonies for the 9th Annual Chrysalis Foundation Benefit.

Your looks are going to die out, and then what's going to be left?""[17] Maxim has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011[155] and number 3 in 2012.[156][157] Esquire magazine named her 2012's Sexiest Woman Alive.[158] She ranked #2 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Women for 2013, behind only Jennifer Lawrence.[159] In 2013, she responded to those lists: ""All I can say is, I feel honored to be considered sexy.""[160]  Christian Dior signed Kunis in 2012 to be the face of its Spring fashion campaign.[161][162] In February 2013, she was named Gemfields global brand ambassador and the face of their advertising campaign.[163] Gemfields is a luxury company that produces emeralds, rubies, and amethysts.

(makers of Jim Beam bourbon).[167] After stating that she donates money to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name she received praise but there were also calls for a boycott of Jim Beam.[168]  Personal life  On September 14, 2011, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Kunis's cellphone and email accounts, along with those of other celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson and Vanessa Hudgens.[169][170][171] Christopher Chaney from Jacksonville, Florida, later pleaded guilty in federal court to nine counts of computer hacking.[172]  In November 2011, Kunis was escorted by Sgt. Scott Moore to a United States Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. Kunis had accepted Moore's invitation in July after he posted it as a YouTube video while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The event celebrated the Marine Corps' 236th anniversary.[173]  Kunis is a supporter of the Democratic Party and Barack Obama.[174] In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: ""The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?""[158]  Health  In January 2011, she revealed her struggle with chronic iritis that had caused temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she had surgery that had corrected the problem.[175] Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, a condition in which the irises are different colors.

"Heath Andrew Ledger[a] (4 April 1979 – 22 January 2008)[1] was an Australian actor and director. After performing roles in several Australian television and film productions during the 1990s, Ledger left for the United States in 1998 to further develop his film career. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the latter two being posthumous releases.[2] He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.[3]  For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role[4] and the Academy Award for Best Actor.[5] Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I'm Not There, which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona.[6]  Ledger died on 22 January 2008[5][1] from an accidental intoxication from prescription drugs.[7][8][9] A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. His untimely death cast a shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production.[10] Ledger received numerous posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards, for which he became the first actor to win an award posthumously,[11] the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture,[12] and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.[4]  Early life [ edit ]  Ledger was born in Perth, Western Australia, the son of Sally Ledger (née Ramshaw), a French teacher, and Kim Ledger, a racing car driver and mining engineer whose family established and owned the Ledger Engineering Foundry.[13] The Sir Frank Ledger Charitable Trust is named after his great-grandfather.[13] He had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.[14] Ledger attended Mary's Mount Primary School in Gooseberry Hill,[15] and later Guildford Grammar School, where he had his first acting experiences, starring in a school production as Peter Pan at the age of 13.[5][13] His parents separated when he was 10 and divorced when he was 11.[16] Ledger's older sister Kate, an actress and later a publicist, to whom he was very close, inspired his acting on stage, and his love of Gene Kelly inspired his successful choreography, leading to Guildford Grammar's 60-member team's ""first all-boy victory"" at the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge.[13][17] Ledger's two half-sisters are Ashleigh Bell (b. 1990), his mother's daughter with her second husband and his stepfather Roger Bell, and Olivia Ledger (b. 1996), his father's daughter with second wife and his stepmother Emma Brown.[18]  Career [ edit ]  1990s [ edit ]  After sitting for early graduation exams at age 17, Ledger left school to pursue an acting career.[16] With Trevor DiCarlo, his best friend since he was three years old, Ledger drove across Australia from Perth to Sydney, returning to Perth to take a small role in Clowning Around (1992), the first part of a two-part television series, and to work on the TV series Sweat (1996), in which he played a gay cyclist.[13] From 1993 to 1997, Ledger also had parts in the Perth television series Ship to Shore (1993); in the short-lived Fox Broadcasting Company fantasy-drama Roar (1997); in Home and Away (1997), one of Australia's most successful television shows; and in the Australian film Blackrock (1997), his feature film debut.[13] In 1999, he starred in the teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About You and in the acclaimed Australian crime film Two Hands, directed by Gregor Jordan.[13]  2000s [ edit ]  From 2000 to 2005, he starred in supporting roles as Gabriel Martin, the eldest son of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), in The Patriot (2000), and as Sonny Grotowski, the son of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), in Monster's Ball (2001); and in leading or title roles in A Knight's Tale (2001), The Four Feathers (2002), The Order (2003), Ned Kelly (2003), Casanova (2005), The Brothers Grimm (2005), and Lords of Dogtown (2005).[19] In 2001, he won a ShoWest Award as ""Male Star of Tomorrow"".[20]  Ledger received ""Best Actor of 2005"" awards from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle for his performance in Brokeback Mountain,[21][22] in which he plays Wyoming ranch hand Ennis Del Mar, who has a love affair with aspiring rodeo rider Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.[23] He also received a nomination for Golden Globe Best Actor in a Drama and a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor for this performance,[24] making him, at age 26, the ninth-youngest nominee for a Best Actor Oscar.[25] In The New York Times review of the film, critic Stephen Holden writes: ""Both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal make this anguished love story physically palpable. Mr. Ledger magically and mysteriously disappears beneath the skin of his lean, sinewy character. It is a great screen performance, as good as the best of Marlon Brando and Sean Penn.""[26] In a review in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers states: ""Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost.""[27]  After Brokeback Mountain, Ledger costarred with fellow Australian Abbie Cornish in the 2006 Australian film Candy, an adaptation of the 1998 novel Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction, as young heroin addicts in love attempting to break free of their addiction, whose mentor is played by Geoffrey Rush; for his performance as sometime poet Dan, Ledger was nominated for three ""Best Actor"" awards, including one of the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, which both Cornish and Rush won in their categories. Shortly after the release of Candy, Ledger was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[28] As one of six actors embodying different aspects of the life of Bob Dylan in the 2007 film I'm Not There, directed by Todd Haynes, Ledger ""won praise for his portrayal of 'Robbie [Clark],' a moody, counter-culture actor who represents the romanticist side of Dylan, but says accolades are never his motivation"".[29] Posthumously, on 23 February 2008, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the film's ensemble cast, its director, and its casting director.[30]  In his penultimate film performance, Ledger played the Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight, which was released nearly six months after his death. While working on the film in London, Ledger told Sarah Lyall in their New York Times interview that he viewed The Dark Knight's Joker as a ""psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy"".[31] For his work on The Dark Knight, Ledger posthumously won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, which his family accepted on his behalf, as well as numerous other posthumous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, which Christopher Nolan accepted for him.[32][33] At the time of his death on 22 January 2008, Ledger had completed about half of the work for his final film performance as Tony in Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.[34][35] Gilliam chose to adapt the film after his death by having fellow actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell play ""fantasy transformations"" of his character so that Ledger's final performance could be seen in theatres.  Directorial work [ edit ]  rightmost) posing with the cast and the director of I'm Not There at the 64th Ledger () posing with the cast and the director ofat the 64th Venice Film Festival in September 2007.  Ledger had aspirations to become a film director and had made some music videos with his production company The Masses, which director Todd Haynes praised highly in his tribute to Ledger upon accepting the ISP Robert Altman Award, which Ledger posthumously shared, on 23 February 2008.[36][30] In 2006, Ledger directed music videos for the title track on Australian hip hop artist N'fa's CD debut solo album Cause An Effect[37] and for the single ""Seduction Is Evil (She's Hot)"".[38][39] Later that year, Ledger inaugurated a new record label, The Masses Music, with singer Ben Harper and also directed a music video for Harper's song ""Morning Yearning"".[31][40]  At a news conference at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, Ledger spoke of his desire to make a documentary film about the British singer-songwriter Nick Drake, who died in 1974, at the age of 26, from an overdose of an antidepressant.[41] Ledger created and acted in a music video set to Drake's recording of the singer's 1974 song about depression ""Black Eyed Dog"" – a title ""inspired by Winston Churchill's descriptive term for depression"" (black dog);[42] it was shown publicly only twice, first at the Bumbershoot Festival, in Seattle, held from 1 to 3 September 2007; and secondly as part of ""A Place To Be: A Celebration of Nick Drake"", with its screening of Their Place: Reflections On Nick Drake, ""a series of short filmed homages to Nick Drake"" (including Ledger's), sponsored by American Cinematheque, at the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, in Hollywood, on 5 October 2007.[43] After Ledger's death, his music video for ""Black Eyed Dog"" was shown on the Internet and excerpted in news clips distributed via YouTube.[41][44][45][46]  He was working with Scottish screenwriter and producer Allan Scott on an adaptation of the 1983 novel The Queen's Gambit by Walter Tevis, which would have been his first feature film as a director. He also intended to act in the film, with Canadian actress Ellen Page proposed in the lead role.[3][47][48] Ledger's final directorial work, in which he shot two music videos before his death, premiered in 2009.[49] The music videos, completed for Modest Mouse and Grace Woodroofe,[50] include an animated feature for Modest Mouse's song, ""King Rat"", and the Woodroofe video for her cover of David Bowie's ""Quicksand"".[51] The ""King Rat"" video premiered on 4 August 2009.[52]  Personal life [ edit ]  Ledger was an avid chess player, playing some tournaments when he was young.[53] As an adult, he often played with other chess enthusiasts at Washington Square Park,[54] though the level of his play has sometimes been exaggerated.[55] Ledger also had a keen interest in the West Coast Eagles, a professional Australian rules football team that competes in the Australian Football League and is based in his hometown of Perth.[56]  Relationships [ edit ]  Ledger had relationships with actresses Lisa Zane, Heather Graham and Naomi Watts.[57][58] In 2004, he met and began dating actress Michelle Williams on the set of Brokeback Mountain. Their daughter, Matilda Rose, was born on 28 October 2005 in New York City.[59] Matilda's godparents are Brokeback co-star Jake Gyllenhaal and Williams' Dawson's Creek co-star Busy Philipps.[60] In January 2006, Ledger put his residence in Bronte, New South Wales up for sale,[61] and returned to the United States, where he shared a house with Williams, in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, from 2005 to 2007.[62] In September 2007, Williams' father confirmed to Sydney's Daily Telegraph that Ledger and Williams had ended their relationship.[63] After Ledger's death, news outlets reported that his drug abuse had prompted Williams to request that he move out of the apartment they shared in Brooklyn.[64]  After his break-up with Williams, in late 2007 and early 2008, the tabloid press and other public media linked Ledger romantically with supermodels Helena Christensen and Gemma Ward. On 30 January 2011, Ward stated that the pair began dating in November 2007 and their families spent Christmas together in their home town of Perth.[65][66][67][68][69][70]  Press controversies [ edit ]  Ledger's relationship with the press in Australia was sometimes turbulent, and it led to his abandonment of plans for his family to reside part-time in Sydney.[71][72] In 2004, he strongly denied press reports alleging that ""he spat at journalists on the Sydney set of the film Candy"", or that one of his relatives had done so later, outside Ledger's Sydney home.[71][72] On 13 January 2006, ""Several members of the paparazzi retaliated ... squirting Ledger and Williams with water pistols on the red carpet at the Sydney premiere of Brokeback Mountain"".[73][74]  After his performance on stage at the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Awards, when he had giggled in presenting Brokeback Mountain as a nominee for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the Los Angeles Times referred to his presentation as an ""apparent gay spoof"".[75] Ledger called the Times later and explained that his levity resulted from stage fright, saying that he had been told that he would be presenting the award only minutes earlier; he stated: ""I am so sorry and I apologise for my nervousness. I would be absolutely horrified if my stage fright was misinterpreted as a lack of respect for the film, the topic and for the amazing filmmakers.""[76][77]  Ledger was quoted in January 2006 in Melbourne's Herald Sun as saying that he heard that West Virginia had banned Brokeback Mountain, which it had not; actually, a cinema in Utah had banned the film.[78] He had also referred mistakenly to West Virginia's having had lynchings as recently as the 1980s, but state scholars disputed his statement, observing that, whereas lynchings did occur in Alabama as recently as 1981, according to ""the director of state archives and history"" quoted in The Charleston Gazette, ""The last documented lynching in West Virginia took place in Lewisburg in 1931.""[79]  Health problems [ edit ]  In their New York Times interview, published on 4 November 2007, Ledger told Sarah Lyall that his recently completed roles in I'm Not There (2007) and The Dark Knight (2008) had taken a toll on his ability to sleep: ""Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. ... I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going.""[80] At that time, he told Lyall that he had taken two Ambien pills, after taking just one had not sufficed, and those left him in ""a stupor, only to wake up an hour later, his mind still racing.""[31]  Prior to his return to New York from his last film assignment, in London, in January 2008, while he was apparently suffering from some kind of respiratory illness, he reportedly complained to his co-star from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Christopher Plummer, that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: ""Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadn't been feeling well on set, Plummer says, 'we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible, damp nights. But Heath's went on and I don't think he dealt with it immediately with the antibiotics.... I think what he did have was the walking pneumonia.' [...] On top of that, 'He was saying all the time, 'dammit, I can't sleep'... and he was taking all these pills to help him.' ""[81]  In talking with Interview magazine, after his death, Ledger's former fiancée Michelle Williams also confirmed reports the actor had experienced trouble sleeping. ""For as long as I'd known him, he had bouts with insomnia. He had too much energy. His mind was turning, turning, turning – always turning.""[82]  Death [ edit ]  At about 3:00 pm (EST), on 22 January 2008, Ledger was found unconscious in his bed by his housekeeper, Teresa Solomon, and his masseuse, Diana Wolozin, in his fourth-floor loft apartment at 421 Broome Street in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan.[5][1]  According to the police, Wolozin, who had arrived early for a 3:00 pm appointment with Ledger, called Ledger's friend Mary-Kate Olsen for help. Olsen, who was in California, directed a New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26 pm, ""less than 15 minutes after she first saw him in bed and only a few moments after the first call to Ms. Olsen"", Wolozin telephoned 9-1-1 ""to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing"". At the urging of the 9-1-1 operator, Wolozin administered CPR, which was unsuccessful in reviving him.[83]  Paramedics and emergency medical technicians arrived seven minutes later, at 3:33 pm (""at almost exactly the same moment as a private security guard summoned by Ms. Olsen"") but were also unable to revive him.[1][83][84] At 3:36 pm, Ledger was pronounced dead, and his body was removed from the apartment.[1][83]  Autopsy and toxicology report [ edit ]  Two weeks later on 6 February 2008, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York released its conclusions, based on an initial autopsy of 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis.[7][85][86] The report concludes, in part, ""Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine."" It states definitively: ""We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications.""[7][9]  While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for insomnia, anxiety, pain, or common cold symptoms (doxylamine), the vast majority of physicians in the US are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone prescribe the same to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone. Although the Associated Press and other media reported that ""police estimate Ledger's time of death between 1 pm and 2:45 pm "" (on 22 January 2008),[87] the Medical Examiner's Office announced that it would not be publicly disclosing the official estimated time of death.[88][89] The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledger's death heightened concerns about the growing problems of prescription drug abuse or misuse and combined drug intoxication (CDI).[8][86][90]  Dr. Jason Payne-James, a forensic pathologist, has believed that Ledger might have survived if hydrocodone and oxycodone had been left out of the combination of drugs that the actor took just prior to his death.[91]  Federal investigation [ edit ]  Late in February 2008, a DEA investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger's death exonerated two American physicians, who practice in Los Angeles and Houston, of any wrongdoing, determining that ""the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications – not the pills that killed him.""[92][93]  On 4 August 2008, citing unnamed sources, Murray Weiss, of the New York Post, first reported that Mary-Kate Olsen had ""refused [through her attorney, Michael C. Miller] to be interviewed by federal investigators probing the accidental drug death of her close friend Heath Ledger ... [without] ... immunity from prosecution"" and that, when asked about the matter, Miller at first declined further comment.[94][95] Later that day, after the police confirmed the gist of Weiss's account to the Associated Press, Miller issued a statement denying that Olsen supplied Ledger with the drugs causing his death and asserting that she did not know their source.[96][97] In his statement, Miller said specifically, ""Despite tabloid speculation, Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,"" emphasizing that media ""descriptions [attributed to an unidentified source] are incomplete and inaccurate.""[98]  After a flurry of further media speculation, on 6 August 2008, the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan closed its investigation into Ledger's death without filing any charges and rendering moot its subpoena of Olsen.[99][100] With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen, and the closing of the investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorney's Office ""don't believe there's a viable target,"" it is still not known how Ledger obtained the oxycodone and hydrocodone in the lethal drug combination that killed him.[100][101]  Effect on fans [ edit ]  Eleven months after Ledger's death, on 23 December 2008, Jake Coyle, writing for the Associated Press, announced that ""Heath Ledger's death was voted 2008's top entertainment story by U.S. newspaper and broadcast editors surveyed by The Associated Press"". He claimed that this was partially a result of the ""shock and confusion"" surrounding the circumstances of Ledger's death, as well as due to Ledger's ""legacy [...] in a roundly acclaimed performance as the Joker in the year's biggest box office hit The Dark Knight.""[102]  Controversy over will [ edit ]  After Ledger's death, in response to some press reports about his will, filed in New York City on 28 February 2008,[103][104] and his daughter's access to his financial legacy, his father, Kim Ledger, said that he considered the financial well-being of his daughter Matilda Rose an ""absolute priority"", whilst also stating that her mother, Michelle Williams, was ""an integral part of our family"". He added, ""They will be taken care of and that's how Heath would want it to be"".[105] Some of Ledger's relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003, prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them, which divides half of his estate between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second, unsigned will, which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose.[106][107] Williams' father, Larry Williams, has also joined the controversy about Ledger's will as it was filed in New York City soon after his death.[108]  On 31 March 2008, stimulating another controversy pertaining to Ledger's estate, Gemma Jones and Janet Fife-Yeomans published an ""Exclusive"" report, in The Daily Telegraph, citing Ledger's uncle Haydn Ledger and other family members, who ""believe the late actor may have fathered a secret love child"" when he was 17, and stating that ""If it is confirmed that Ledger is the girl's biological father, it could split his multi-million dollar estate between ... Matilda Rose ... and his secret love child.""[109][110][111] A few days later, reports citing telephone interviews with Ledger's uncles Haydn and Mike Ledger and the family of the other little girl, published in OK! and Us Weekly, ""denied"" those ""claims"", with Ledger's uncles and the little girl's mother and stepfather describing them as unfounded ""rumors"" distorted and exaggerated by the media.[112][113]  On 15 July 2008, Fife-Yeomans reported further, via Australian News Limited, that ""While Ledger left everything to his parents and three sisters, it is understood they have legal advice that under Western Australia law, Matilda Rose is entitled to the lion's share"" of his estate; its executors, Kim Ledger's former business colleague Robert John Collins and Geraldton accountant William Mark Dyson, ""have applied for probate in the West Australian Supreme Court in Perth, advertising for 'creditors and other persons' having claims on the estate to lodge them by 11 August 2008 ... to ensure all debts are paid before the estate is distributed....""[114] According to this report by Fife-Yeomans, earlier reports citing Ledger's uncles,[105] and subsequent reports citing Ledger's father, which do not include his actual posthumous earnings, ""his entire fortune, mostly held in Australian trusts, is likely to be worth up to $20 million.""[114][115][116]  On 27 September 2008, Ledger's father Kim stated that ""the family has agreed to leave the US$16.3 million fortune to Matilda,"" adding: ""There is no claim. Our family has gifted everything to Matilda.""[115][116] In October 2008, Forbes estimated Ledger's annual earnings from October 2007 through October 2008 – including his posthumous share of The Dark Knight's gross income of ""US$1 billion in box office revenue worldwide"" –– as ""US$20 million.""[117]  Legacy [ edit ]  Memorial tributes and services [ edit ]  Memorial for Ledger, outside 421 Broome Street, SoHo , Manhattan, 23 January 2008  As the news of Ledger's death became public, throughout the night of 22 January 2008, and the next day, media crews, mourners, fans, and other onlookers began gathering outside his apartment building, with some leaving flowers or other memorial tributes.[118][119]  The next day, at 10:50 am Australian time, Ledger's parents and sister appeared outside his mother's house in Applecross, a riverside suburb of Perth, and read a short statement to the media expressing their grief and desire for privacy.[120] Within the next few days, memorial tributes were communicated by family members; the Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd; the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, Eric Ripper; Warner Bros. (distributor of The Dark Knight) and thousands of Ledger's fans around the world.[121][122][123][124]  Several actors made statements expressing their sorrow at Ledger's death, including Daniel Day-Lewis, who dedicated his Screen Actors Guild Award to him, saying that he was inspired by Ledger's acting; Day-Lewis praised Ledger's performances in Monster's Ball and Brokeback Mountain, describing the latter as ""unique, perfect"".[125][126] Verne Troyer, who was working with Ledger on The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus at the time of his death, had a heart shape, an exact duplicate of a symbol that Ledger scrawled on a piece of paper with his email address, tattooed on his hand in remembrance of Ledger because Ledger ""had made such an impression on [him].""[127] British indie band Kasabian paid tribute to Ledger in their song 'Vlad the Impaler', with the line ""Joker, meet you on the other side"". Singer Tom Meighan often changes the word ""Joker"" to either ""Ledger"", or the names of recently deceased celebrities.  On 1 February, in her first public statement after Ledger's death, Michelle Williams expressed her heartbreak and described Ledger's spirit as surviving in their daughter.[128][129]  After attending private memorial ceremonies in Los Angeles, Ledger's family members returned with his body to Perth.[130][131]  On 9 February, a memorial service attended by several hundred invited guests was held at Penrhos College, attracting considerable press attention; afterward Ledger's body was cremated at Fremantle Cemetery, followed by a private service attended by only 10 closest family members,[132][133][134] with his ashes interred later in a family plot at Karrakatta Cemetery, next to two of his grandparents.[131][135][136] Later that night, his family and friends gathered for a wake on Cottesloe Beach.[137][138][139]  In January 2011, the State Theatre Centre of Western Australia in Ledger's home town of Perth named a 575-seat theatre the Heath Ledger Theatre after him. For the opening of the theatre, Ledger's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was on display in the theatre's foyer along with his Joker costume.[140]  Bon Iver's ""Perth"" was inspired by Heath Ledger.[141] Justin Vernon, the lead singer and songwriter of the American indie folk band, revealed back in 2011 that he had begun working on the song in 2008 and was scheduled to meet with a music video director who was good friends with Ledger, Matt Amato. ""The first thing I worked on, the riff and the beginning melodies, was the first song on the record, 'Perth,'"" Vernon told Exclaim!.[142] Amato was directing the band's ""The Wolves (Act I & II)"" music video the day that Ledger died. ""It was no longer about just making a Bon Iver music video anymore,"" Vernon says. ""This was now our chance to be there with Matt as he grieved. It was a three-day wake."" Amato told Vernon stories about Ledger that eventually became the inspiration for ""Perth,"" the opening track to the band's second studio album Bon Iver, Bon Iver (2011).[141]  Method and style [ edit ]  Rolling Stone Ledger on the March 2006 cover of  ""You know when you see the preachers down South? And they grab a believer and they go, 'Bwoom! I touch you with the hand of God!' And they believe so strongly, they're on the ground shaking and spitting. And fuck's sake, that's the power of belief... Now, I don't believe in Jesus, but I believe in my performance. And if you can understand that the power of belief is one of the great tools of our time and that a lot of acting comes from it, you can do anything."" —Ledger, during the interview with Rolling Stone in 2006, on belief, power and acting.[143]  Portraying a variety of roles, from romantic heroes to the reluctantly oppressed, Ledger created a hodgepodge of characters that are deliberately unlike one another, stating ""I feel like I am wasting my time if I repeat myself"". He also reflected on his inability to be happy with his work, ""I feel the same thing about everything I do. The day I say, 'It's good' is the day I should start doing something else.""[144] Ledger liked to wait between jobs so that he would start creatively hungry on new projects.[145] In his own words, acting was about harnessing ""the infinite power of belief,""[143] thus using belief as a tool for creating.  Directors who have worked with the actor praised him for his creativity, seriousness and intuition. ""I've never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents,"" The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan has written, expressing amazement over the actor's working process, genuine curiosity and charisma.[145] Marc Forster, who directed Ledger in Monster's Ball, complimented him as taking the job ""very seriously"", being disciplined, observant, and understanding and intuitive. In 2007, director Todd Haynes compared Ledger's presence to actor James Dean, casting Ledger as Robbie Clarke, a fictive personification of Bob Dylan in I'm Not There. Drawing on the similar characteristics between the actors, Haynes further highlighted Ledger's ""precocious seriousness"" and intuition. He also felt that Ledger had a rare maturity beyond his years.""[144] Ledger, however, disconnected himself and acting from perfectionism. ""I'm always gonna pull myself apart and dissect [the work]. I mean, there's no such thing as perfection in what [actors] do. Pornos are more perfect than we are, because they're actually fucking.""[143]  ""Some people find their shtick,"" Ledger reflected on the categorisation of style. ""I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognisable'... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That's fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note.""[144]  Posthumous films and awards [ edit ]  Ledger's death affected the marketing campaign for Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008)[10][34] and also both the production and marketing of Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, with both directors intending to celebrate and pay tribute to his work in these films.[34][35][146][147] Although Gilliam temporarily suspended production on the latter film,[35] he expressed determination to ""salvage"" it, perhaps using computer-generated imagery (CGI), and dedicated it to Ledger.[81][148][149] In February 2008, as a ""memorial tribute to the man many have called one of the best actors of his generation,"" Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to take over Ledger's role, becoming multiple incarnations of his character, Tony, transformed in this ""magical re-telling of the Faust story"".[150][151][152] The three actors donated their fees for the film to Ledger's and Williams's daughter.[153]  Speaking of editing The Dark Knight, on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007, Nolan recalled, ""It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day. ... But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish.""[147] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no ""digital effects"" to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously.[154] Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory, as well as to the memory of technician Conway Wickliffe, who was killed during a car accident while preparing one of the film's stunts.[155]  Released in July 2008, The Dark Knight broke several box office records and received both popular and critical accolades, especially with regard to Ledger's performance as the Joker.[156] Even film critic David Denby, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in The New Yorker, evaluates Ledger's work highly, describing his performance as both ""sinister and frightening"" and Ledger as ""mesmerising in every scene"", concluding: ""His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss.""[157] Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger's performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger's co-star and friend Christian Bale, who played opposite him as Batman, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as ""the most fun I've ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character.""[10][158] Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy, calling it ""absolute nonsense"" and going on to say, ""Heath was so solid. His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I've ever met.""[159]  Ledger received numerous awards for his Joker role in The Dark Knight. On 10 November 2008, he was nominated for two People's Choice Awards related to his work on the film, ""Best Ensemble Cast"" and ""Best Onscreen Match-Up"" (shared with Christian Bale), and Ledger won an award for ""Match-Up"" in the ceremony aired live on CBS in January 2009.[160]  On 11 December 2008, it was announced that Ledger had been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight; he subsequently won the award at the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony telecast on NBC on 11 January 2009 with Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan accepting on his behalf.[12][32]  Film critics, co-stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine and many of Ledger's colleagues in the film community joined Bale in calling for and predicting a nomination for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in recognition of Ledger's achievement in The Dark Knight.[161] Ledger's subsequent nomination was announced on 22 January 2009, the anniversary of his death.[162]  Ledger went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, becoming the second person to win a posthumous Academy Award for acting (after fellow Australian actor Peter Finch, who won for 1976's Network), as well as the first comic-book movie actor to win an Oscar for their acting. Ledger's family attended the ceremony on 22 February 2009, with his parents and sister accepting the award on stage on his behalf.[163][33] Following talks with the Ledger family in Australia, the Academy determined that Ledger's daughter, Matilda Rose, would own the award. However, due to Matilda's age, she will not gain full ownership of the statuette until her eighteenth birthday in 2023.[164] Until that time, her mother Michelle Williams, will hold the statuette in trust for Matilda.[165]  On 4 April 2017, a trailer was released for the upcoming documentary I am Heath Ledger which was released on 3 May 2017.[166] It features archival footage of Ledger and interviews.[167]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Music video [ edit ]  Accolades [ edit ]  See also [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ Many sources normally considered reliable say that his birth name was Heathcliff; however, Ledger himself denied this, saying his name was always just Heath.

Meghan Markle appeared close to tears during a moving Anzac Day dawn service where fiance Prince Harry honoured New Zealand and Australia's war dead.  During the poignant event staged as the sun's rays broke over the London skyline, Ms Markle looked emotional as the hymn Abide With Me was sung by thousands gathered at the New Zealand war memorial.  The US actress, who wore a grey coat and large brimmed hat, passed a cultural milestone when she, and Harry, were given a traditional Maori welcome.  The couple were welcomed by Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana - the London Maori Club - with a traditional hongi, the soft pressing of noses and the sharing of each other's breath.  Ms Markle was making her first appearance at a service marking Anzac Day - April 25 - the anniversary of the start of the First World War Gallipoli landings, and a national day of remembrance for Australia and New Zealand.	0
"Charlize Theron just might be entering the world of Wonder Woman after all.  After scheduling issues made the actress turn down a role in the DC Extended Universe film, it appears that she's very open to appearing in Wonder Woman 2. During a panel at last month's San Diego Comic-Con, Theron addressed the possibility of reuniting with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins - who previously teamed up with the actress in Monster.  ""Look I would love to work with her again."" Theron revealed. ""I had such an incredible time. I trusted her from the first time I met her. That’s a big thing for an actor, to be able to trust your director that way and she just never disappointed. She’s incredible so to see her have this moment, I just feel incredibly happy for her."" Considering the success of 2003's Monster - which earned Theron a Best Actress Oscar - a reunion between the two in Wonder Woman 2 feels like a no-brainer. While nothing is currently confirmed, Jenkins appears to agree, judging by a letter Theron was given at the SDCC panel.  ""Getting to work with Charlize and what we did together will always be remembered as a great high point of my life."" Jenkins explained. ""She’s a tremendous person, talent, artist, and actor, but also a wonderful and incredibly unique spirit who brings that dynamism to every part she plays. She’s hard, yet soft, tough, yet yielding. It was a wonderful and rare gift and I can’t wait to work with my friend again one day."" Ultimately, time will tell if Theron is officially cast in Wonder Woman 2. But it's definitely worth noting that both she and Jenkins are on board with the idea.  Wonder Woman has an 86.52 ComicBook.com Composite Score and a 4.33 out of 5 ComicBook.com User Rating, making it the fourth-highest ranked comic book movie of all time among ComicBook.com readers.

"(Jim Lo Scalzo for USN&WR)1. One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, ""Little Nancy"" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10. A true San Franciscan, Pelosi makes sure that her office is stocked with Ghirardelli chocolates. Her diet typically consists of mostly chocolate and chocolate ice cream. Completing the notoriously challenging New York Times crossword puzzle is one of her favorite hobbies.Sources:www.house.govwww.notablebiographies.comTimeThe GuardianThe EconomistThe New York TimesThe Financial Times"	1

Imagine being in the public eye since the bright-eyed age of seven, wherein every part of your career and personal life become public fodder. Despite the intense emotional toll that this might take on someone, Selena Gomez has managed to navigate a path with grace and has it figured out.  At a mere 25-years-old, the actress-slash-singer is pretty much a confident sage when it comes to body positivity—especially since her life-saving kidney transplant, which she got earlier this year to help with her autoimmune disease called lupus.  “When I look at my body now, I just see life,” Gomez tells Billboard in a recent interview (oh yeah, she just won their ‘Woman of the Year’ award, NBD). “There are a million things I could do—lasers and creams and all that stuff—but I’m okay with it. I don’t have perfect abs, but I feel like I’m wonderfully made.”  “I don’t have perfect abs, but I feel like I’m wonderfully made.”  That’s not to say this self-confidence came easily—especially as she’s facing a newly minted surgery scar (which she admits was “hard in the beginning”). “I remember looking at myself in the mirror completely naked and thinking about all the things that I used to bitch about and just asking, ‘Why?'” she says.  Now, after all that she’s been through (which is a lot), Gomez is feeling all of the positive vibes. “I just keep thinking about how much my body is my own,” she says. “[After the surgery] I had this sense of gratitude for myself. I don’t think I’ve ever just stopped and been like, ‘I’m actually grateful for who I am.’ I do. I didn’t, but I do now.” Hey, everyone should love themselves like a love song (had to).  For more Selena love, this is the super healthy way that Gomez starts her day. And these are her empowering bags that she made in collab with Coach.	1
"Antonia passed away in March of last year due to a fatal battle with pneumonia.  On the upcoming third season, Teresa visits the Hollywood Medium where he revealed to E! News that it was one of the hardest readings he has done yet.  ""That was really probably one of the toughest ones of the entire season because Teresa's reading, her grief was still very tangible. It was really clear in her face,” he told E! News exclusively.  ""She was still very much grieving her mother. And I think the reading came at an important time. I think it was necessary for her to have that experience. I think it's one of those ones where it will take time for her to really process the magnitude. Not only the experience but also of her grief. It was just a really vulnerable, emotional side of Teresa that I think people will see and be able to relate to. And I really appreciate that she put her grief so openly out there to the world because people will relate to it and also be able to heal from it who are in similar situations, just through that reliability. So that was really special.”  The good thing about the reading was that it brought Teresa some much needed closure, according to Tyler. ""I think obviously the inherent nature of this is comforting in knowing that our loved ones are around. I think for her it was also just about talking through the physical loss and I think she was still very much focused on that physical loss, and that's a very normal state to be in especially when a passing is so recent.”  He also added that Antonia made no mention of Teresa’s past legal troubles nor her husband Joe's future behind bars.  ""When she came through, her mother was really very much just focused on the present moment,"" he said. ""And obviously her death came at a very difficult time when the family was going through a lot and anticipating a lot so I think she was just very much focused on kind of picking up those pieces and regrouping. There were messages that focused towards the future obviously for Teresa. I don't know what will be shown, what won't, but it was all very positive. There was nothing that came through that was any way negative and it was just very much focused on telling her what to focus on and what's worth your energy, what's not. Just help to provide that clarity for her so that was good.”"	0
"The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”[adrotate banner=""3""]The NFL has thus far refused comment."	1
The Kardashian-Jenner crew is expanding their annual, cheer-spreading Christmas card to cover an entire month — and keeping fans guessing with daily sneak peeks.  Since the start of the month, Kim Kardashian West and the photographer behind the card — Eli Linnetz — have been sharing images from the shoot on social media, much like an advent calendar. Linnetz wrote on Instagram that the series is titled, The 25 Days of Xmas.  On Dec. 1, Kim posted the first image: a photo of son Saint, 2, in denim jeans as he posed by neatly wrapped brown presents with white ribbon. It’s the toddler’s first holiday card, as he was only a few weeks old when sister North and cousins Penelope, Mason and Reign Disick starred in the 2015 photo wearing coordinating chic black outfits. (The family opted to not release a card in 2016.)	0
"​It seems that the person most surprised by Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson dating is Davidson himself, as the SNL star can't not talk about how lucky he feels to be dating the pop star.      Onstage at the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club, a source tells ​E! News that ""[Pete] said he didn't have a skit prepared because he didn't really want to be there,"" but ""he said he's really happy and life's good so there's nothing to complain about.""  ""Someone in the crowd yelled Ariana's name and said how attractive she is,"" explained the source. ""He smiled but really didn't want to give much info other than that it's pretty cool how he got someone like her.""

Blake Shelton is releasing a third track, “Turnin’ Me On,” from his album Texoma Shore and it’s a love song inspired by his girlfriend Gwen Stefani.  The new release from Blake has the country singer and “The Voice” coach singing about all the things that turn him on about his girlfriend of 3 years, Gwen.  “She’s turning me on, turning me on / Pushing my buttons like it ain’t no thing / If I’m what she wants, she gets what she wants / The neon’s buzzing when she pulls that string / Turning me on like it’s her job / Sometimes I think she must get off on / Turning me on, turning me on.”  Blake began writing the song by himself and as he got on a roll, he asked his songwriter friend to help him finish it.  “We’re sitting on my bus one day early in 2017 and I think I was in Baton Rouge,” said Blake. “I was up there alone and I had my guitar, started playing a little melody that I was hearing in my head and next thing you know I started writing a song. I wrote a verse, then I wrote a chorus, then I realized it was going somewhere and I felt good about it. Like I always [have] in the last couple of years, I called up my friend Jessi Alexander and said, ‘Man, I think I’m onto something and I need somebody way better than me to try to bring this thing home.’ She and I and Josh Osborne ended up writing this song, I’m super proud of it—and it’s not hard to figure out who this song is about.”  After hearing Blake record the new song, what did Gwen think of her beau’s ode to her? “She liked it,” Blake told Seth Meyers. “I didn’t say I wrote the song about her then. I just said I wrote the song and then she figured it out. There’s a line that says ‘She’s Revlon red,’ because she’s the Revlon girl.”  “And when my body’s beside hers / There ain’t no turning back / She’s Revlon red in the blackest night / Lighting up the room in the world just like she’s turnin’ me on.”  “Turnin’ Me On,” featured on Blake’s current album Texoma Shore, is the follow up to Blake’s No. 1 hit “I’ll Name the Dogs,” and most recent single, “I Lived It.”	1
Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.	1

Does Margot Robbie reciprocate co-star Brad Pitt’s rumored feelings for her? We’ll explain what’s really going on between these two!  Sorry, this won’t be a Mr. & Mrs. Smith situation. Margot Robbie, 28, has eyes for one man, and it’s not for her co-star Brad Pitt, 54! The two actors began filming for Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time In Hollywood earlier this summer, and rumors sprung that Brad had the hots for Margot. While that’s yet to be confirmed, we can confirm this: Margot is respecting her wedding vows! “Margot is madly in love with her husband Tom,” a friend of Margot’s shares EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. Just a reminder — Margot wedded Tom Ackerley, 28, the producer for her film I, Tonya, on December 18, 2016! “Even if Brad tried, he would never be able to woo her away.”  Margot’s admiration for Brad — because really, you can’t help but admire the knockout — is purely professional! “Margot thinks Brad is amazing, hot, sexy, really talented and she has the utmost respect for him, but there’s absolutely no crush on her part,” the Suicide Squad‘s friend adds. “She’s only got eyes for Tom. Margot thinks her husband is the best looking guy on the planet, even Brad Pitt can’t compete with Tom, at least not for Margot.” Yup, you heard that right — not even Brad Pitt! Well, we hope Tom can relax after hearing those kind words. As we’ve told you, Margot’s husband has reportedly been wary of Brad, supposedly dropping by onset of Once Upon a Time In Hollywood and “keeping a close eye on Brad,” a source close to Margot and Tom claimed to Life & Style in its Aug. 29 issue.  How did this rumored love triangle mess even start? Well, Brad was reportedly “smitten” with Margot, another Life & Style source claimed, which we reported on July 26. The source went so far as to claim that the actors’ other co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, “has called [Brad] out for layering it on so thick [with Margot].” None of this has been confirmed, and Brad could just be a happy (almost legal) bachelor minding his own business! He does have an ongoing custody battle with his soon-to-be ex-wife Angelina Jolie, 43, to worry about.	1

"“I just got wasted the whole time,” he revealed during an interview with The Times. “You feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. Became a total liability.”  But now, according to a source, Robert is back on the straight and narrow, thanks to his fiancé FKA Twigs.  The insider tells OK! “Rob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.”  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.  ""He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,” adds the source. “Rob’s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn’t given up his pot habit. He doesn’t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.”  But we haven’t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!"	1

"It’s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.  Though the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other’s lives, co-parenting their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 — together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.  Then on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.  “Ben’s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,” a source told ET. “He continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.”  Since their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.  Here’s everything she’s said about Affleck since their split:  July 2018  Garner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, “Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really — I could cry talking about it.”  She added, “What I think I’ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, ‘cause you think that’ll end the, ‘Are they engaged? Are they not?’ And that’s true in reverse, as well. If you are — if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there’s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, ‘Oh, you’ve had to go through this in public.’ The public isn’t what’s hard. What’s hard is going through it.”  June 2018  For Father’s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, “Our kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.”  November 2017  In an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, “I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”  May 2017  After People magazine released a cover story about Garner’s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.  “This isn’t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom’s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,"" she said. ""I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it’s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete.”  October 2016  Garner spoke with ET’s Denny Directo at the Save the Children Illumination Gala about how she and Affleck have chosen to raise their kids.  “It’s so important that you model for your kids how to be a citizen of the world, and I think that’s the best thing you can do,” she told ET, adding that she and Affleck each have special causes that they try to teach their kids about.  “That’s really important at home, to make sure that our kids know that we both have causes that we care so much about… that we dedicate time, resources, and our energy toward making our own little slice of the world a little bit better,” she said.  August 2016  'We are definitely a modern family': #JenniferGarner talks to @nmoralesnbc about family and marriage https://t.co/jJpZAE5BoG — TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 4, 2016  Garner was praised on the Today show for putting her kids first while dealing with the end of her marriage.  “It has to be,” she said. ""You don’t have a choice. It has to be.”  Calling their family unit “definitely a modern family,” she added, “We’re doing really well.”  She also opened up about her decision to take her kids to London for the filming of Justice League, in which Affleck played Batman.  “Ben was working on Justice League, and I thought, ‘Well, the kids should have that experience,'” she explained. “He and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.”"	1

"That's a wrap for ""Southern Charm New Orleans."" Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season -- and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole.  Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily.  Last week's penultimate episode marked the low-water mark, drawing fewer viewers -- 640,000 -- than any other episode so far this season. Nothing charming about that. (Viewership figures on Sunday's eighth and final episode were not available.)  By comparison, the ""Southern Charm"" mother ship, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has yet to register fewer than 1 million voters in any of the nine episodes that have aired so far as part of its fifth season.  So, while there will certainly be some people who will mourn the end of ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" should Bravo decide to pass on a second season, I've got a feeling most people won't miss it -- because they apparently stopped watching pretty early on.  The reason behind the erosion of interest in the show is pretty simple to nail down: It was boring, built around limp writing and clumsily staged attempts at drama.  Granted, no reality show is actually ""real."" But if a producer wants his or her show to draw a reliable base of return viewers, they've got to help those viewers buy into the illusion. That was seldom the case with ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's an upside to it all, it's that the show was not the pox on local culture that many feared. In fact, its New Orleansness seemed to get more and more watered-down with nearly every episode, eventually reduced to little more than Chamber of Commerce images flashed between scenes, with an occasional bowl of gumbo thrown in. That's just as well, given that the show's efforts at including local culture in early episodes was ham-handed at best.  Even then, though, with so few people watching, it's hard to get too terribly worked up about it. As they say: No harm, no foul.  For those few who did watch regularly, producers were kind enough to wrap up most of the show's loose narrative threads in Sunday's finale. Below find a recap of the high points (and low points) of the Season 1 finale of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  The title: ""Better Late Than Pregnant.""  The centerpiece drama of the week: In what was perhaps the show's cheapest stunt yet -- and its most manufactured -- producers pulled a full-on okey-doke on viewers, in the form of a pregnancy scare for cast member Reagan Charleston.  That particular plot point was teased during the closing moments of the previous episode, but before getting to it in Episode 8, producers had hubby Jeff Charleston express his eagerness to become a father -- followed by Raegan informing him that she's not quite ready yet to be a mom. The next thing we know, her period is conveniently late.  So, she does what anybody would do: She takes a pregnancy test. At a huge season-ending party thrown by fellow cast member Jon Moody. And using a pregnancy test that was a gag gift at an adult Easter egg hunt from Episode 7.  And after all that? Spoiler alert: She ain't preggers.  That's right, ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" fans. You just got punk'd.  In all honestly, it's probably for the best, as on Monday (June 4) -- the day after the finale aired -- Reagan and Jeff announced they are separating.  The libation of the week: A French 75, ordered at breakfast by Tamica Lee.  The New Orleans cliche of the week: From a practical standpoint, the idea of throwing a party to end the season was a pretty good one, giving producers the opportunity to get everybody together one last time -- and decked out in their Sunday best -- to wrap up the season's myriad dramas.  That being said, it's nothing short of shameless that they framed it as a ""Jazz Fest launch party."" The show, and the episode has nothing to do with Jazz Fest. The cast never went to Jazz Fest. In fact, music has played a minor role in the series at best.  The honest question of the week: Speaking of the show's lack of focus on music, why didn't producers pick a local musician or two when they were casting the show? Not only would they have gotten some great music out of it, but the real behind-the-scenes dramas that play out on the local music scene have got to be better than the fake ones that played out on Season 1 of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's one thing that could get me interested in a second season, that would probably be it.  The real moment of the week: Of all the lose threads tied up in the season finale, easily the most touching was the reconciliation between cast member Tamica Lee and her daughter, third-grader Rani, with whom she butted heads in a previous episode -- and who has struggled with the fact that she's the only black kid at her school.  After sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the help of supporting cast member Susan Henry, Tamica and Rani hugged it out -- and cried it out -- in what was probably the sweetest moment of the season.  Granted, it all happened during a staged radio interview at local station WBOK, but this is one case where the end justifies the means. On a related note: If there's an MVP of the season, it's Rani, as far as I'm concerned.  The manufactured moment of the week: Raegan's pregnancy scare. (See ""The centerpiece drama,"" above.)  The quote of the week: ""We're just having some conversations."" -- Justin, to mother Dottie Reese, after she walked in on a heated conversation between Justin and girlfriend Kelsey.  I don't know why, but that line cracked me up. In fact, it's not just the quote of the week. It might be the quote of the whole season. I'm think I'm going to start using it whenever anybody butts into a conversation I'm having with somebody else.  Them: ""What are you guys talking about?""  Me: ""We're just having some conversations."" (Exits.)  The winner: The King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese's day job is. Every episode this season, they've bought airtime during the show for a commercial that prominently features Justin -- and which never fails to fool me into thinking the show is back on, thus prompting me to stop fast-forwarding through the commercials.  Granted, I start fast-forwarding again immediately upon realizing it's a commercial, but I know the firm's name now, whereas I didn't' before.  Nicely played, King Firm. Nicely played.  The loser: Me, for actually sitting through all eight episodes.  On the plus side, it's all been documented through the following stories, so future generations can remember the season that was.  As for me, I'm going to start trying to forget it, starting now.

Home for the spring holidays! The night before Easter, admirably friendly exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon reunited to celebrate with their 5-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan. The “Emotions” singer took to Instagram to post a sweet snap of the family decorating Easter eggs . In the adorable photo, the family of four sits around a kitchen table dying eggs in all sorts of pastel colors for Easter. “Easter with #demkids,” she shared with her followers. “#moments #rocandroe #easter #family @nickcannon.”  Looks like the pop-megastar is trying to change the nickname of her growing twins to #demkids, who have been referred to by fans as #dembabies since their birth in 2012. The duo were married in April of 2008 but the “Honey” singer filed for divorce December of 2014.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SZfWl8gS/  Carey and Cannon’s Easter celebration just a week after the “Glitter” actress announced she had split from backup dancer, Bryan Tanka after a year of dating. According to TMZ, Tanaka felt “disrespected” when Carey and Cannon, 36, attended the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards with their children on March 11. Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at Carey and her friendship with Cannon by flirting with other women. Per TMZ, the pair have not seen or spoken to each other since they traveled to Cabo together at the end of March.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SjBrF1Et/  The “Butterfly” singer also suffered heartbreak in October of 2016 after confirming her breakup with Australian billionaire, James Packer. The former couple had been together ever since being introduced to each other by their mutual friend, producer Brett Ratner, at the premiere of 2014’s Hercules.  Cannon has also had some big life changes this year after becoming a father for the third time over announcing the birth of his son Golden “Sagon” Cannon on his Instagram Page on Tuesday, Feb. 21. The Wild ’N’ Out star captioned the photo. “Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning! No matter how hard the world may hit you, God always reminds us of our purpose! #TrueHappiness, welcome to Earth Son!” added Cannon, 36.

"Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia  Miley Cyrus had no filter when it came to gushing about everything from her new music to her relationship with Liam Hemsworth in Billboard's new cover story, but there was one passage that had readers stopping short and lingering on her comments on hip-hop, specifically, for her brief characterization of it as materialistic and misogynistic.  The comment came about when she name-checked Kendrick Lamar's ""Humble"" as an inspirational track, and Cyrus specified why she loved the DAMN. single — or what she doesn't love about other rap, really. ""I love [""Humble""] because it’s not 'Come sit on my dick, suck on my cock,'"" she told Billboard. ""I can’t listen to that anymore. That’s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much 'Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock' — I am so not that.""  Once swift, angry blowback followed the publication of the piece, Cyrus took to Instagram to share her side of the story, or her account of what didn't make it into print: She stressed that the comment was made in a broader conversation and that she's an ""artist without borders"" who was asked about her thoughts on rap for this particular conversation.  ""A lot of the time publications like to focus on the most sensationalized part of the conversation,"" she writes. ""So, to be clear I respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music (country, pop, alternative .... but in this particular interview I was asked about rap) I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop as I've collaborated with some of the very best! At this point in my life I am expanding personally/musically and gravitating more towards uplifting, conscious rap!""  She closes by reminding her followers that she's got new music coming — her single, ""Malibu,"" from her forthcoming album is set to drop on May 11 — and that she hopes that her words ""encourage others to LOVE."" Her note is way closer to her mission than the comments she made in passing, that's for sure, so we'll wait and see if any ""uplifting, conscious rap"" makes it way onto the record."	1

As has become a tradition for Ryan Murphy programming, the day has finally come — FX promotional materials aside — that we can gaze upon the actors he’s hired to portray historical figures for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Since the world can only handle so much suspense in being exposed to Penélope Cruz’s bleach-blonde Donatella, we put together side-by-side comparisons of Versace’s actors and their real-life counterparts to give you a taste of what’s to come, as well as some historical information to appraise you on who’s who. Knowledge is power, readers!  Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  Cunanan, a gay gigolo with a genius-level IQ who lived his formative years in California, is known to have murdered at least five people throughout his 1997 killing spree, which began with his murder of an acquaintance in Minneapolis. Cunanan is believed to have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, which in turn made him “crave the limelight and aspire to the top, whether through charm or falsehood,” according to Vanity Fair’s Maureen Orth. Eight days after killing Versace, he committed suicide on a houseboat in Miami.  Edgar Ramírez as Gianni Versace  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  At the time of his death, the Versace empire had amassed a reputation as one of the most innovative and popular fashion houses in the world, during which time Gianni also absorbed a devoted celebrity clientele. (“A good designer must cultivate himself. Read, absorb everything,” he once told Charlie Rose in an interview. “To be superficial, you have to be profound.”) He was also open about his sexuality, becoming one of the first prominent celebrities to reveal he was gay in the ’80s. He was 50 years old when murdered by Cunanan.  Penélope Cruz as Donatella Versace  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  While Donatella is now known as the spunky HBIC and artistic director of Versace, things were different back in 1997. At the time of her brother’s murder, she was running her own diffusion label of the brand, Versus Versace, which was created specifically for her by Gianni. Upon his death — which she did not witness — Donatella was given full creative control of the Versace brand, eventually guiding it through numerous iconic and memorable collections throughout her continuing tenure. She’s rarely spoken about Gianni, though she spoke to the Guardian about him on the 20th anniversary of his death. “When my brother was murdered, I had the eyes of the whole world on me and 99 percent of them thought I wasn’t going to make it,” she said in part. “And maybe I thought the same, at first. My brother was the king, and my whole world had crashed around me.” In the days following his murder, Donatella and most of the Versace family retreated to a private Caribbean resort due to safety concerns.  Ricky Martin as Antonio D’Amico  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  D’Amico, an Italian model and fashion designer for Versace Sport, was Gianni’s companion for 15 years. He was eating breakfast inside the Miami mansion when the murder occurred, later describing how he fell into a deep depressive state in the subsequent years. “I had never been through a depression and never saw a therapist as I was advised to: why did I need to tell someone else what had happened when I knew I was this way because Gianni’s death had torn me in two?” he recently told the Guardian in a rare interview. “I was in a nightmare, I felt nothing and gave no importance to anything … the house, the money … because it felt false to have expectations of life.” D’Amico has been living a “simple” life in the Italian countryside with his new long-term partner for several years now.  Mike Farrell as Lee Miglin  Photo: Getty Images  Miglin — a real-estate mogul based in Chicago, who rose from a poor background to achieve his success — was the third victim of Cunanan’s murder spree prior to Versace’s murder. The extremely gruesome May 1997 crime scene, which was widely covered at the time by the Chicago Tribune, was described as a murder “that would be considered vicious in any Chicago neighborhood, let alone the city’s most expensive.” The Miglin family has repeatedly denied that Lee, or anyone else in the extended family circle, ever had a personal connection to Cunanan.  Judith Light as Marilyn Miglin  Photo: FX Networks/HSN  A former dancer who built a beauty empire at the Home Shopping Network, Miglin was married to her husband, Lee, for nearly 40 years. She has rarely spoken about her husband in the years since his murder, with her only substantial interview appearing in the Chicago Tribune a year after Lee’s death. “I don’t think you heal — you never close up that gaping wound — but you adjust,” she said at the time. “I lived the life of a fairy princess and I had a prince for 38 years, and then one day my prince went to war and didn’t come back.” Miglin’s products on HSN continue to be wildly popular.	0

In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.source “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”source site Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.get link “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”ikili opsiyon egitim “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.	1

San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.	1
"Hollywood speaks out against director James Toback after sexual harassment allegations  Celebrities have been quick to condemn the writer-director after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women.  On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had sexually harassed at least 38 women (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his Hollywood reputation to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly bring them to his hotel room and ask them questions about their sex lives. Some of his accusers claim he'd then rub his groin against their legs or start masturbating in front of them.  Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""biologically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to the medication he was taking for both diabetes and a heart condition.  It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged behavior over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published.  ""The damn has broke. Women will no longer be silent. We have your back and will amplify,"" actress Debra Messing wrote.  ""One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors. James Toback is a disgrace,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted.  Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn penned a lengthy Facebook post, describing how he personally knew at least 15 women that Toback had harassed or assaulted. Enraged at Toback's alleged behavior, Gunn wrote, ""For over twenty years now, I've been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him.""  ""James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for traumatizing,"" Charmed star Rose McGowan wrote.  ""So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig: James Toback,"" xXx actress Asia Argento tweeted out.  As Nicki Swift previously reported, McGowan and Argento have recently come out about the alleged sexual harassment and assault they were victims to at the hands of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of sexual misconduct by dozens of women in the entertainment industry. After Weinstein's alleged behavior was exposed by both The New York Times and The New Yorker, he was fired from his position at The Weinstein Company, was left by his wife, Georgina Chapman, and became the subject of investigations by the NYPD, the LAPD, and London police.  Only time will tell if Toback faces similar consequences."	0
Ed Westwick.  Days after actress Kristina Cohen alleged that Gossip Girl star Ed Westwick raped her at his home, a second actress has come foward. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, former actress Aurélie Wynn (known professionally as Aurelie Marie Cao) claimed that Westwick raped her in 2014. Westwick has denied the allegations.  In her post Wynn wrote, “[A]nd like Kristina, I said no and he pushed me face down and was powerless under his weight. I was wearing a one piece bathing suit that he ripped, I was in complete shock, I am also very tiny.”  Wynn wrote that she told her boyfriend at the time, Glee actor Mark Salling, about the incident. Salling, who has since pleaded guilty for possession of child pornography, allegedly broke up with her and blamed her. She also wrote that she was encouraged by friends to stay quiet and that people would think she was “just out trying to get my 10 seconds of fame.”  Westwick responded to Cohen’s claims on Tuesday in an Instagram post saying he did not know Cohen and had never raped anybody.  A post shared by Ed Westwick (@edwestwick) on Nov 7, 2017 at 8:46am PST  Cohen filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department, which is now investigating if the “suspect forced victim to have sexual intercourse inside his residence … three years ago.”  Following Wynn’s allegations, Westwick posted a second denial on Instagram on Thursday.  A post shared by Ed Westwick (@edwestwick) on Nov 9, 2017 at 9:52am PST  This post has been updated to include Westwick’s second statement.	0

A day after Megyn Kelly admitted that the news of Matt Lauer’s sudden firing from NBC “hit close to home,” she has invited the women who have come forward against Lauer, as well as Lauer himself, onto her show.  “As hard as it is to report on one of our own colleagues, we remain committed to telling people’s stories if they choose to come forward,” said Kelly during Thursday’s episode. “The women in this case, too – the Matt Lauer case – are invited and welcome to do exactly that on this show. We have been that place in all the other cases, and we will be that place – as well as for the accused – on this hour.”  Shortly before making that announcement, she discussed with NBC’s Stephanie Gosk the difficulty of reporting on a case about someone that she interacted with on such a frequent basis.  “You don’t want to be getting that explicit about a colleague that you worked with 24 hours ago,” admitted Kelly. “But that’s how we’re going to report it here for you at NBC because that’s our commitment to you – to bring you the truth and to do a full and fair investigation of this story as it comes to us.”  Watch the full clip to listen to the entire conversation between Kelly and Gosk.  Lauer was fired on Wednesday after NBC received “a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer.” In the wake of his firing, multiple women came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Lauer. The disgraced NBC anchor released a statement on Thursday in response to the claims and his termination. “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” Lauer said in the statement, which was read by TODAY co-host Savannah Guthrie on the show’s Thursday broadcast. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  He added, “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.  “Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I’m committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It’s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace.”	0
Gwen Stefani feels like the luckiest girl to be dating Blake Shelton.  When asked earlier Tuesday about the rumors speculating if her boyfriend of two years has been named PEOPLE’s Sexiest Man Alive, the mother of three, 48, gushed about her man.  “What? Oh my God, well they got that right!” Stefani told Access Hollywood.  “Wow, I knew I was on to something. Wow, I’m gonna look really good huh? I already had scored but now I really scored,” she continued.  And even if Shelton is not this year’s pick, Stefani said: “I still score.”  Kevin Mazur/BBMA2017/Getty  The couple has been hot and heavy since they began dating in November 2015 when they met as coaches on The Voice, not long after Shelton’s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani’s divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale.  And they’ve been inseparable ever since.  WATCH: Gwen Stefani Calls Boyfriend Blake Shelton the ‘Perfect’ Sexiest Man Alive  From red carpet appearances and on-stage performances to their undying support of one another from a distance and their sweet selfies, the pair are a match made in heaven — blending their families together, sharing holidays, and even collaborating on songs including “Go Ahead and Break My Heart” (off of Shelton’s album, If I’m Honest), and “You Make It Feel Like Christmas” (the title track of Stefani’s Christmas album).  Even Shelton’s longtime Voice costar Adam Levine previously said during a Howard Stern Show interview: “They’re so in love it’s disgusting. It’s so funny. They found each other at really interesting times in their lives. It’s really beautiful.”	1
(Spoilers ahead for the final season of Netflix’s “House of Cards”)  “House of Cards'” final season is here and now we know how the show wrote out Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood.  The short story is: He’s dead, which we’ve known for a while without knowing any other meaningful details. When the season begins, its mentioned that he died in his sleep and we see photos of Robin Wright’s Claire Underwood, now president, looking at her dead husband’s casket. But here’s what happened, as far as we know:  After Claire declined Frank’s phone call in the Oval Office (when Season 5 ended, she was supposed to pardon him for, well, all that stuff he did over the course of the series), she mentions to the camera it was the last time they spoke. Two months later, Frank storms into the White House, furious at Claire for not giving him the pardon she promises she would. Scared, Claire locked herself in her room and found Frank dead in his bed the next morning. She told the public they were both in that bed. And, privately, she believes he was murdered.  Also Read: Here's Everything Coming to and Leaving Netflix in November  An autopsy revealed he died from an overdose from his liver medication, which Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) claims is something he wouldn’t do by accident.  And, of course, it wasn’t an accident, though what exactly happened isn’t revealed until the very last scene of the series. It turned out that Frank was murdered by Doug, who mixed up the medication. Doug says that he killed Frank because Frank was going to murder Claire for not following through on her promise. As Doug explains it, “I had to protect the legacy from the man.”  The idea here throughout the season is that Doug Stamper is obsessed with protecting Frank’s reputation above all else. While everybody else is scheming nonstop and jockeying for power, Doug is constantly switching sides as he tries to figure out which side will actually prevent Frank’s name from being dragged through the mud.  Also Read: 'Sabrina': Biggest Differences Between Netflix Series' Premiere and Comics Issue #1  And he murdered Frank for exactly that reason. If Frank were to murder Claire there’s almost no way he would have been able to get away with it, and would thus would be remembered almost entirely for having done that. So Doug had to kill him.  Spacey was fired from the Netflix series last December, following multiple accusations of sexual assault. Netflix also dropped Spacey’s film “Gore,” on famous writer Gore Vidal, in the wake of the accusations. Though he’s obviously never seen — even the photos of Clair looking at his casket don’t show his face, and Frank made audio diaries that are mentioned often but never heard — Frank Underwood’s presence as the show’s lead for the first five seasons is felt throughout the final season.  In fact, much of what Claire has to deal with as president is weathering the fallout from all the political deals Frank made while president. This is especially apparent with the Shepherds (Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane), who serve as the season’s main antagonists after Claire won’t honor deals they made with Frank.  The sixth and final season of “House of Cards” is now available on Netflix.	0

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Daniella Silva  Disneyland Paris apologized after a 3-year-old was told he could not take part in a “Princess for a Day” experience just because he is a boy.  Noah, who is a super fan of Princess Elsa in the film “Frozen” was “buzzing with excitement” when he learned about the makeover opportunity at the Disneyland Hotel, the boy’s mother, Hayley McLean-Glass, wrote in an open letter on her blog. The hotel is located near the entrance of the park in the suburbs of Paris, France.  McLean-Glass, who is from Devon, England, wrote that she decided to book the experience for Noah as early Christmas gift.  “I knew that there would be NOTHING he'd love more than to get to wear a pretty dress, put make up on like Mummy does and have his photo taken being one of his beloved Disney Princesses,” she wrote.  Disneyland Paris' description of the service on its website reads: ""Grant every little girl's wish with a real Princess's make-up and hair-styling session; a fairytale transformation they'll treasure forever.""  Noah McLean-Glass, three, stands next to his mother, Hayley McLean-Glass.

McLean-Glass said she felt her son had been discriminated against because of his gender.  ""The way I look at it, if a little girl went to Disneyland and wanted to do a pirate experience or a 'Spider-Man' experience, there would be no way that they would stop a girl from doing that because there would be an uproar,"" she said.

"Chris Rock is opening up about his intense divorce.  The 52-year-old comedian and his ex wife, Malaak Compton-Rock, split in 2014 after 19 years of marriage, and their divorce was finalized last August. They share two daughters together, 12-year-old Zahara and 14-year-old Lola. Rock covers Rolling Stone's latest issue, and in the revealing cover story, talks about his complicated marriage.  The story includes bits of Rock's stand-up routines over the past few months, in which he says he was unfaithful during the relationship.  NEWS: Chris Rock's Daughter's Girl Scout Cookies Brought Us 8 of the Greatest Moments in Oscar History  ""I was a piece of sh**,"" he tells the crowd during one comedy show.  According to the magazine, he later talks about his affairs and ""gets disarmingly specific, describing three women: one famous, one semifamous, and one a member of the retail class."" Now, the actor is clearly jaded to the idea of marriage.  ""Would I ever get married again?"" he says. ""Not if it would cure AIDS.""  Rolling Stone  The Grown Ups 2 star also talks about his fame in the interview, and how it played into the divorce.  ""My faults are magnified,"" he says. ""Your significant other, if they really love you, has a high opinion of you. And you let them down.""  Still, he says he's now toned down talking about his marriage out of respect for his ex-wife.  ""It's not fair,"" he notes. ""I have a mic, she doesn't. God forbid people are bugging her in the supermarket. That's not cool. I'm going to have to see her at weddings and graduations.""  Rock says he's never had a breakdown about his split, though admits he cried once during their custody battle.  ""We live in a world where men are assumed to not have feelings,"" he shares. ""All my friends assume I moved into the city after my divorce, away from my girls. When I say I bought a house around the corner, it blows their minds.""  The Saturday Night Live alum at one point gets candid while talking to the Rolling Stone writer, who is married with a toddler.  ""You got a kid now. You'll be fine. You need each other,"" he notes. ""Need is big. A woman breaks up with you, the first thing she says is 'I don't need this sh**.' She doesn’t say, 'I don't love you,' she says she doesn't need you.""  ""My own daughter has blocked me on Instagram,"" he adds. ""They grow up so quick.""  Now, the comedian says he's in the middle of ""starting over.""  ""Getting divorced, you have to f**king start over,"" he says. ""You get to reset. It's not a breakdown, but something in your life broke down.""  EXCLUSIVE: Kevin Hart Supports Chris Rock  Still, Rock has plenty of A-list friends to help him through.

'That's it. The rest we had very courteous conversation, very respectful. He never asked me to go to his room or anything like that and never, nothing like that!'  She insisted the pair played the 'game' in interviews for ten years and she said she didn't like that the 2004 interview was being associated with the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  Anne-Marie also said she wasn't a 'victim,' despite what people might think.  All for show: She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more  Making headlines: Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein (pictured) drama, Anne-Marie said she was once asked up to his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away'  Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein drama, Anne-Marie said he once asked her to visit his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away.'  'Professional settings have to stay professional,' she said, but defended his victims who unknowingly went up to his hotel suite with him.  'When one says no, it's no,' she added.  Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben.  'This was for the camera. You have to understand that we have done dozens and dozens of interviews like that. It was for a show I was producing, so I was not at all a victim,' she said.  The video starts by showing Anne-Marie sitting on Ben's lap facing him as he's heard saying: 'They would like it better if you did the show topless.'  Having her say: Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben  He then turns her around so she can face the camera before he places his head on her chest.  'This is a lovely perfume you have on,' he says as the two hold each other.  He then says: 'You usually show a lot more cleavage than this. What's the story? Why are you covering it up today?'  'It's Sunday morning,' she responds.  'It's Sunday morning? That never stopped you before from getting them ti****s out,' Ben says back to her in the interview that lasted for more than five minutes.  But despite what the video appears to show, Anne-Marie said it 'has been blown out of proportion.'  She told the publication she had an uncomfortable encounter with Harvey, years ago.  'He did invite me once at the Toronto Film Festival to go up to his suite for an interview. Of course I did not go. He said, ""I would be more comfortable in my suite."" I said, ""Umm, no."" I am not saying something would have happened, but I made sure nothing happened,' she said.  Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party.  Annamarie Tendler, who is the author of The Daily Face and Pin It, asked for an apology from the actor over the alleged incident in a Tweet on Wednesday.  Claims: Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party  'I would also love to get an apology from Ben Affleck who grabbed my a** at a Golden Globes party in 2014,' she Tweeted.  She followed that tweet up with more detail, saying: 'He walked by me, cupped my butt and pressed his finger into my crack.  'I guess he tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way and oops touched my butt instead of my lower back?  'Like most women in these situations I didn't say anything but I have thought a lot about what I'd say if I ever saw him again,' she concluded.  Writer and comedian, Jen Statsky, who is known for her work on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, also tweeted about Annamarie's allegations.  Controversial: Ben had made a statement condemning Harvey's alleged abusive actions, saying he was 'saddened and angry' over the 'sickening' claims, which was slammed by Annamarie and Jen  'I was also at this party and *multiple* friends had this same exact experience,' she wrote on Twitter.  Ben had made a statement condemning Harvey's alleged abusive actions, saying he was 'saddened and angry' over the 'sickening' claims, which was slammed by Annamarie and Jen.  The statement was also slammed by Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, who called Ben a liar.  Actress Hilary Burton meanwhile said she 'didn't forget' when Ben 'grabbed her breasts' on TRL, in 2003.  He since apologised to Hilary, in a Tweet."	0

"CLOSE Kathy Griffin is ready to laugh about the time a photo got her in hot water with the feds and the president. This summer she plans to tour North America, including a sold-out gig at Carnegie Hall in New York. (April 2) AP  Kathy Griffin performs during her Laugh Your Head Off Tour on July 19 in Hollywood. (Photo: Allen Berezovsky, Getty Images)  HOLLYWOOD – Kathy Griffin is back on U.S. soil, and she’s got a lot of material to get off her chest.  The comedian brought her Laugh Your Head Off World Tour to Hollywood Thursday night, serving up almost three hours of comedy in a high-octane set. In front of a packed house, Griffin gleefully spilled the tea on everything from the federal investigation surrounding her controversial fake and bloody Donald Trump photo shoot that went round the world to how she really feels about Ellen DeGeneres. (Spoiler: They are not friends).  At the sold-out Dolby Theater, Griffin, gearing up for the long haul in a pair of flats, ran out on stage jumping and dancing. “They said I would never work again, and you came!” she said to the packed crowd. Here's what to expect from Griffin’s latest act:  Kathy Griffin: 'Truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi’  More: Kathy Griffin on tour, that 'harmless' bloody Trump photo, her gripe with Kevin Hart  There’s plenty of President Trump – and his family  “I’ve known this fool off and on for 20 years,” said Griffin, harking back to the time she first met Trump on the set of ""Suddenly Susan."" ""He said, 'Call me The Donald,' to which I said, 'OK – call me The Kathy.' And then I walked away."" Griffin went on to give less-than-flattering nicknames for Trump's adult children and doubled down on the president's purported ties with Russia. ""You know that pee-pee tape exists!"" she exclaimed.  A feud with Ellen DeGeneres  Griffin described how she got into a fight with DeGeneres after her mentor and friend Joan Rivers died. “One of the things that always hurt (Rivers) is that Ellen shunned her and thought she was vulgar and not funny,” Griffin said. “After Joan died I just called (DeGeneres) and I said, ‘Woman to woman, comic to comic, let it go and do a tribute to her ...' We got into a screaming match,"" said Griffin, adding: ""She’s scarier than the government.”  Kim and Kanye are actually good neighbors  Only in Hollywood would it turn out that Griffin and Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West were honest-to-goodness neighbors. “We actually had a shared wall,” said Griffin, revealing she has changed her stance on the reality show family. She even once called Kim to ask if her kids could come over to cheer up her 98-year-old mother, Maggie. (They came!) “I am pro-Kardashian,"" Griffin said. ""They let me make fun of them to their face, which is all I ask.”  No one is spared  Griffin let loose on a Rolodex of frenemies. Targets included her former publicist Cindi Berger (“I can’t get a publicist at all, so I can burn the bridge”), former New Year's Eve BFF Anderson Cooper (whom she referred to as ""Anderson Vanderbilt""), former Bravo boss Andy Cohen, Jeff Zucker (“He’s not smart enough to run CNN. He’s the guy who gave Emeril a sitcom!”), her short-lived attorney Lisa Bloom, Matt Lauer and Megyn Kelly.  Her darkest moments  Griffin said she spiraled after her Trump photo shoot brouhaha. Within days, her career imploded: Griffin’s stand-up shows were canceled, CNN fired her, and advertisers fled. Griffin recalled even getting dumped by Squatty Potty: ""That one hurt,” she deadpanned.  But for two months, ""I almost didn't leave my house at all,"" she said. Griffin closed by describing her FBI interrogation (an experience that wove together a sword, a porn awards show and Martha Stewart). She also championed First Amendment rights, imploring the audience to continue supporting comics who dare to take on the administration. “Over my dead body will I let this happen to another woman again,” she pronounced.

"Bruno Mars was the big winner at this year's Grammy Awards - winning all six awards he was nominated for, including album of the year.  His album 24K Magic picked up record of the year for the title track, song of the year for That's What I Like and best R&B album.  But Mars' victory was rap's defeat.  Jay-Z was the leading nominee with eight nods but left empty handed, one year after his wife Beyonce missed out on album of the year to Adele.  Kendrick Lamar, widely expected to pick up the evening's main prize for his fourth album DAMN, was limited to rap-only categories.  He picked up five awards, including best rap album and best rap performance.  :: Hillary Clinton's Fire And Fury skit at Grammys  Image: Jay Z with his wife Beyonce and daughter Blue Ivy at the Grammys  The evening was not just a disappointment for those who hoped to see rap break out from genre-specific categories, but it was also noticeably short on female winners.  In a politically charged ceremony where the Time's Up movement and the #MeToo campaign were celebrated, and where invitees wore white roses to support victims of sexual harassment, only one female artist picked up a major award.  Newcomer Alessia Cara won best new artist, considered the least important category of the main five.  0:29 Video: Elton, U2 & Gaga shine at Grammys  In total, only a fifth of the Grammys handed out at the ceremony were given to female-led bands or female solo artists.

Looks like Margot Robbie is going to need some aloe for this burn! At the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday, Nov. 5 in LA, Margot, 27, excitedly approached Angelina Jolie to introduce herself. But instead of a warm reply, Angie “curtly replied, ‘I know who you are’ and turned her back on Margot,” an insider exclusively tells In Touch.  According to the source, the Australian-born beauty “looked shocked.” Jealousy may be to blame. When Margot starred in 2015’s The Big Short alongside Angelina’s ex Brad Pitt, “rumors swirled about Brad crushing on Margot and that Angelina had tried to stop Brad from casting Margot in the film,” says the insider.  (Photo Credit: Splash)  The source says that the mom-of-six — who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9, and Knox, 9, with Brad, 53 — can’t shake her resentment toward the Suicide Squad actress. “It was clear from Angelina’s reaction to Margot that she still holds a grudge,” the source says.  Back in November 2016, not long after Angelina, 42, filed for divorce from Brad, OK! Magazine reported that the Fight Club hunk was “ready to move on” with Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now,” a source said at the time. “This was a sore subject with [Angelina] who blocked them from working together a few times. Now that he’s single again, you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.”  While a romance between Brad and Margot never flourished, the eternal heartthrob has recently fell for 21-year-old British actress Ella Purnell — who, in an ironic twist, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent. He’s so enchanted, a source previously told In Touch, that he cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.  “Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,” said the source. “Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she’s getting from Brad. She’s told friends he’s always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.”  For more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!

Kevin Spacey has issued an official statement in response to allegations made by actor Anthony Rapp, who told BuzzFeed News that Spacey made a drunken sexual advance on him when he was just 14 years old. Spacey, who claimed not to remember the incident, said that if he did do what Rapp has alleged, then he owes him the “sincerest apology” for his “inappropriate” behavior. Rapp described Spacey climbing on top of him on a bed at a party in 1986 before he was ultimately able to get away and leave the room. Spacey also took the opportunity to address the rumors about his sexuality, revealing for the first time publicly that he “chooses” to “live as a gay man.” In a 2010 interview with The Daily Beast, Spacey declined to specify his sexual orientation, saying, “No one’s personal life is in the public interest. It’s gossip, bottom line.”	0
"Oprah Winfrey was born in the rural town of Kosciusko, Mississippi, on January 29, 1954. In 1976, Winfrey moved to Baltimore, where she hosted a hit television chat show, People Are Talking. Afterward, she was recruited by a Chicago TV station to host her own morning show. She later became the host of her own, wildly popular program, The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired for 25 seasons, from 1986 to 2011. That same year, Winfrey launched her own TV network, the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN).  In 2005, Winfrey helped give The Color Purple a new life onstage as one of the producers of the 11-time Tony-nominated musical, which ran on Broadway until 2008. A revival of the musical, which Winfrey co-produced in 2015, won a Tony Award.  With the debut in 1999 of Oxygen Media, a company she co-founded that is dedicated to producing cable and Internet programming for women, Winfrey ensured her place in the forefront of the media industry and as one of the most powerful and wealthy people in show business. In 2002, she concluded a deal with the network to air a prime-time complement to her syndicated talk show. Her highly successful monthly, O: The Oprah Magazine debuted in 2000, and in 2004, she signed a new contract to continue The Oprah Winfrey Show through the 2010-11 season. At the time, the syndicated show was seen on nearly 212 U.S. stations and in more than 100 countries worldwide.  The media giant contributed immensely to the publishing world by launching her ""Oprah's Book Club,"" as part of her talk show. The program propelled many unknown authors to the top of the bestseller lists and gave pleasure reading a new kind of popular prominence.  Winfrey, who became almost as well-known for her weight loss efforts as for her talk show, lost an estimated 90 pounds (dropping to her ideal weight of around 150 pounds) and competed in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C., in 1995. In the wake of her highly publicized success, Winfrey's personal chef, Rosie Daley, and trainer, Bob Greene, both published best-selling books.  In 1994, with talk shows becoming increasingly trashy and exploitative, Winfrey pledged to keep her show free of tabloid topics. Although ratings initially fell, she earned the respect of her viewers and was soon rewarded with an upsurge in popularity. Her projects with Harpo have included the highly rated 1989 TV miniseries, The Women of Brewster Place, which she also starred in. Winfrey also signed a multi-picture contract with Disney. The initial project, 1998's Beloved, based on Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Toni Morrison and starring Winfrey and Danny Glover , got mixed reviews and generally failed to live up to expectations.  Winfrey launched The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1986 as a nationally syndicated program. With its placement on 120 channels and an audience of 10 million people, the show grossed $125 million by the end of its first year, of which Winfrey received $30 million. She soon gained ownership of the program from ABC, drawing it under the control of her new production company, Harpo Productions ('Oprah' spelled backwards) and making more and more money from syndication.  In 1976, Oprah Winfrey moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where she hosted the TV chat show People Are Talking. The show became a hit and Winfrey stayed with it for eight years, after which she was recruited by a Chicago TV station to host her own morning show, A.M. Chicago. Her major competitor in the time slot was Phil Donahue . Within several months, Winfrey's open, warm-hearted personal style had won her 100,000 more viewers than Donahue and had taken her show from last place to first in the ratings. Her success led to nationwide fame and a role in Steven Spielberg 's 1985 film The Color Purple, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  American television host, actress, producer, philanthropist and entrepreneur Oprah Gail Winfrey was born on January 29, 1954, in Kosciusko, Mississippi. After a troubled adolescence in a small farming community, where she was sexually abused by a number of male relatives and friends of her mother, Vernita, she moved to Nashville to live with her father, Vernon, a barber and businessman. She entered Tennessee State University in 1971 and began working in radio and television broadcasting in Nashville.  OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network  In 2009, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be ending her program when her contract with ABC ended, in 2011. Soon after, she moved to her own network, the Oprah Winfrey Network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications.  Despite a financially rocky start, the network made headlines in January 2013, when it aired an interview between Winfrey and Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist and seven-time Tour de France winner who was stripped of his Tour titles in 2012 due to doping charges. During the interview, Armstrong admitted to using performance-enhancing substances throughout his cycling career, including the hormones cortisone, testosterone and erythropoietin (also known as EPO). ""I am deeply flawed ... and I'm paying the price for it, and I think that's okay. I deserve this,"" he stated. The interview reportedly brought in millions of dollars in revenue for OWN.  Of her interview with Armstrong, Winfrey said in a statement, ""He did not come clean in the manner I expected. It was surprising to me. I would say that, for myself, my team, all of us in the room, we were mesmerized by some of his answers. I felt he was thorough. He was serious. He certainly prepared himself for this moment. I would say he met the moment. At the end of it, we both were pretty exhausted.""  In March 2015, Winfrey announced that her Chicago-based Harpo Studios would close at the end of the year to consolidate the company’s production operations to the Los Angeles-based OWN headquarters. Winfrey’s television empire was launched at the studio and it had been home to her daily syndicated talk show through its finale in 2011. ""The time had come to downsize this part of the business and to move forward. It will be sad to say goodbye,"" said Winfrey, ""but I look ahead with such a knowing that what the future holds is even more than I can see.""  Winfrey returned to acting in Greenleaf, which marked her first recurring scripted television role. The original family drama, which revolves around a Memphis megachurch, premiered on OWN in June 2016.  In December 2017, it was announced that Discovery had become the majority owner of OWN with the purchase of 24.5 percent of the company from its founder for $70 million. Winfrey retained 25.5 percent of OWN and remained its chief executive under terms of the agreement.  Activism, Charity and Awards  According to Forbes magazine, Oprah was the richest African American of the 20th century and the world's only Black billionaire for three years running. Life magazine hailed her as the most influential woman of her generation. In 2005, Business Week named her the greatest Black philanthropist in American history. Oprah's Angel Network has raised more than $50 million for charitable programs, including girls' education in South Africa and relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Winfrey is a dedicated activist for children's rights; in 1994, President Clinton signed a bill into law that Winfrey had proposed to Congress, creating a nationwide database of convicted child abusers. She founded the Family for Better Lives foundation and also contributes to her alma mater, Tennessee State University. In September 2002, Oprah was named the first recipient of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Bob Hope Humanitarian Award.  Campaigning for Barack Obama  Winfrey campaigned for Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama in December 2007, attracting the largest crowds of the primary season to that point. Winfrey joined Obama for a series of rallies in the early primary/caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. It was the first time Winfrey had ever campaigned for a political candidate.  The biggest event was at the University of South Carolina football stadium, where 29,000 supporters attended a rally that had been switched from an 18,000-seat basketball arena to satisfy public demand. ""Dr. (Martin Luther) King dreamed the dream. But we don't have to just dream the dream any more,"" Oprah told the crowd. ""We get to vote that dream into reality by supporting a man who knows not just who we are, but who we can be.""  In her final season of her talk show, Oprah made ratings soar when she revealed a family secret: she has a half-sister named Patricia. Oprah's mother gave birth to a baby girl in 1963. At the time, Oprah was nine years old, and living with her father. Lee put the child up for adoption because she believed that she wouldn't be able to get off public assistance if she had another child to care for. Patricia lived in a series of foster homes until she was seven years old.  Patricia tried to connect with her birth mother through her adoption agency after she became an adult, but Lee did not want to meet her. After doing some research, she approached a niece of Winfrey's, and the two had DNA tests done, which proved they were related. Winfrey only learned of her sister's existence a few months before she made the decision to publicize the knowledge. ""It was one of the greatest surprises of my life,"" she said on her show.  In November 2013, Winfrey received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. President Barack Obama gave her this award for her contributions to her country.  In February 2018, after a shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 people dead, Winfrey announced she would follow the example set by George and Amal Clooney and donate $500,000 to the March for Our Lives demonstration scheduled for March 24.  She tweeted: ""George and Amal, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am joining forces with you and will match your $500,000 donation to 'March For Our Lives.' These inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we've had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.""  2018 Golden Globes Speech: #MeToo, Female Empowerment  In January 2018, Winfrey became the first African-American woman to be honored with the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Award, for lifetime achievement. In a powerful speech, she recalled being inspired by seeing Sidney Poitier honored at the Globes decades earlier, before emphasizing the importance of a free press and the power of speaking the truth in a ""culture broken by brutally powerful men.""  ""So I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,"" she said, in closing. ""And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, 'Me too' again.""  The overwhelming reception to the speech was such that many began calling for the media mogul and personality to run for president. Winfrey generally downplayed the suggestion that she would do so, though she admitted to People that the support had her entertaining the idea, and prompted her to check with the Big Guy upstairs for guidance: ""God, if you think I’m supposed to run, you gotta tell me, and it has to be so clear that not even I can miss it,"" she recalled, adding that she had yet to receive clear affirmation to proceed.  Other Projects: '60 Minutes,' Oprah's Favorite Things Lives On  In January 2017, CBS announced that Winfrey would join the newsmagazine 60 Minutes as a special contributor in the fall.  Winfrey introduced her ""Oprah's Favorite Things"" holiday list during her time as a talk show host, and continued the annual tradition even after moving on to other projects. For the 2017 edition, featured on Amazon, she became the first celebrity behind Alexa, the company's voice-control system, allowing shoppers to hear Oprah herself explain her top picks for the season.  Relationship with Stedman  Winfrey has been in a relationship with Stedman Graham, a public relations executive, since the mid-1980s. They became engaged in 1992, but never tied the knot. The couple lives in Chicago, and Winfrey also has homes in Montecito, California, Rolling Prairie, Indiana, and Telluride, Colorado."	0

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The actress Prince Harry looks set to pop the question to could not be more suited, say pals - because her student days were perfect training to keep up with the playboy prince.  While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan’s days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: “It’s surreal because I haven’t been back since I graduated.  “And as I’m walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  “The 24-hour Burger King also ­definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.”  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university’s School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove – Prince Charles’s country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  She said: “We’re intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we’re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  “Meghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  “She was in charge of bringing in new girls – you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  “I lived in the house for a year and it’s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you’d mix with.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  “All of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies… you develop very strong friendships.”  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then – and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.

One former student claimed: “Meghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  “You can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago – it’s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.  (Image: GC)  “She seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.” The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence – after 36 years as a students’ favourite – following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  “It was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,” general manager Chris Nora said. “It doesn’t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.  (Image: WireImage)  Door staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, ‘It’s about time!’”  Already an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana’s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William’s wife Kate and Harry’s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan’s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned “Rachel Markle” – and another captioned “Meghan Markle”.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world’s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe.	1
Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day. May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  In case you need a reminder of the striking Givenchy design Markle wore earlier in the day, here it is in all its royal-wedding glory:  Getty Images  Anyway, here's hoping the newlywed couple has a happy reception party at Frogmore House, the name of which I cannot stop saying in my head.

"Is it just us, or is Scott Disick's girlfriend, Sofia Richie, starting to look more and more like his ex Kourtney Kardashian every day?! Though Sofia is half Kourtney's age, fans can’t help but notice that the 19-year-old has practically become Kourt’s twin.  Take Sofia’s most recent Instagram post as a prime example. Casually posing next to Scott with her sun-kissed glow, Sofia is rocking a thin pair of black sunglasses, high-waisted jean shorts, a billowy white top, and chic white sandals. If that outfit doesn’t scream Kourtney Kardashian, we don’t know what does! Even her pose is Kardashian-esque.  A post shared by Sofia Richie (@sofiarichie) on Jul 8, 2018 at 8:40am PDT  Naturally, fans spoke up about it. ""Uh, for a moment I thought that was Kourtney Kardashian,"" one fan wrote. ""[Sofia Richie] looks as if she’s Kourtney Kardashian’s little girl,"" wrote another. Of course, this isn’t the first time Sofia has been caught looking like Kourt. In fact, it all started over the holidays in 2017, after Sofia traded in her golden locks for a dark brunette 'do. Keep scrolling for some #twinning side-by-side pics of Scott’s present gal looking just like his past.  (Photo Credit: Splash)  It's not just their taste in fashion that's eerily similar — it's their mannerisms, too. Just take a glance at one of their countless mirror selfies — both sans pants, of course!  (Photo Credit: Instagram)  The two women have no problem flaunting their fabulous figures, whether they're chilling out at home or rocking a barely-there swimsuit at the beach.  (Photo Credit: Splash)  Earlier this year, Sofia wore an itty-bitty bikini while in Mexico with Scott, and Lord Disick himself couldn't help but show her off, posting several shots of her on Instagram. Unlike Kourtney, Sofia isn't shy when it comes to packing on the PDA with her man, as an onlooker told E! News, ""Scott and Sofia went in the hot tub and kissed and made out. Scott gave Sofia a massage and they had their arms wrapped around each other. They are very happy together, always cracking each other up and laughing together.""  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Though Sofia may be channeling Kourt's appearance, their personalities are clearly different. While Scott was constantly partying during his on-off romance with Kourtney, an insider told Life & Style that Sofia has actually managed to tame his bad boy ways. ""Kourtney is giving Sofia credit for turning Scott into a better man, and more importantly, a better father,"" the insider revealed.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Angelina Jolie is being consoled by her former co-star Johnny Depp in the wake of her split from Brad Pitt, it's been claimed.  The mum-of-six, 41, and Johnny starred together in romantic thriller Tourist back in 2009 and are said to have remained friends ever since.  The pair also share the same divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, who represented Johnny through his divorce from estranged wife Amber Heard.  Johnny, 53, reportedly recommended Laura, who has worked with a string of high-profile celebrity clients in the past, to Angelina after the actress was there to support him during his bitter break up.  ""Angelina idolised Johnny for years before she worked with him on The Tourist, and then the pair of them really hit it off on set,"" a source claimed to The Sun.  They continued: “But the two of them have stayed in touch ever since then, and spoke regularly during the storm that surrounded Johnny’s break up with Amber.

But they have been speaking about the situation, and Angelina hired Johnny’s lawyer to represent her based on the advice that he has given her.  “Her friends are now speculating about what could happen between them if she and Brad are not reconciled and their divorce goes through.”  Meanwhile, Hollywood star Brad - who is said to be 'wrecked' by the fact he hasn't been able to see his kids - is at the centre of claims he clashed with 15-year-old son Maddox on board a private plane days before his wife filed for divorce.  TMZ reports that although the FBI is investigating the incident between Brad, 52, and Maddox, the case is likely to be dropped as conflicting accounts make it impossible to prove what happened.  And according to the website: ""DCFS [Department of Children & Family Services] social workers saw no evidence of injuries on Maddox and no one filed a police report after the incident.""  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  Sources close to Brad have previously insisted that allegations of abuse against him are ""exaggerated and fabricated"" with sources close to the actor hitting out at the ""smear campaign"" against him.  A source told DailyMail.com: ""These claims are exaggerated and fabricated.  ""It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.  ""They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of verbal disagreements like major households.  (Image: Getty Images)  ""Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.""  Maddox was adopted by Angelina from Cambodia when he was only a few months old in 2002 and Brad, who started dating Angelina a few years later, adopted him in 2006.  The couple also have children Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight together and all six children were onboard the flight when the row broke out.

Selena Gomez doesn’t have a single negative thing to say about Taylor’s new boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. In an interview with Nicole Ryan on The Morning Mash Up Monday, the host asked her about The Weeknd and mentioned Joe in the process.  ‘Both of you have some new things going on in your lives. You have some new people in your lives. Have you gotten a chance to hang together with your new people?’  Gomez, who recently split with Bieber and is now seeing the Toronto native, said, ‘I spend time with my new person a lot. Honestly, If my friends are happy, that makes me happy. That is all I care about.’  Selena went on to say she was ‘super stoked,’ and that so far, it’s been a magnificent time for the both of them.  Unfortunately, Gomez didn’t reveal too much about Taylor’s new flame, but if the country star is happy, then Joe must have gotten the seal of approval!  And how is her romance doing?  As CI readers know, Gomez has spent the last few months as The Weeknd’s favorite girl, and according to the songstress, she ‘loves being supportive’ of him.  Selena said her favorite part is when she gets to go to his concert with her hair done up in a bun and ‘dance all night,’ without worrying about the pressures that come with her performances.  And speaking of grand performances, the One Love Manchester concert ended last night with a stadium packed with 60,000 people and the 13 Reasons Why star couldn’t have been more impressed with the show.  Advertisement  When the host and the singer were discussing the One Love concert in the United Kingdom, Selena showed a lot of maturity when she refused to talk down to her ex-boyfriend. The 24-year-old said she thought ‘Justin did great,’ and the event was fantastic; everyone involved did such a great job.	0

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving on with their lives a year after filing.  The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn’t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.  Since then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.  “They’re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,” a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. “They continue to remain cordial to one another. There is a lot of love and respect there.”  Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck. Pascal Le Segretain/Getty; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic  The day before the holiday, the whole family made a group trip to Sea Life Park in Oahu. “They made a family trip to interact with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays,” a source told PEOPLE. “They spent several hours at the park and looked like they had the best time. The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.”  During the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. “Jen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn’t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,” added the source.  “The kids love when they all spend time together,” said a second source.  When filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. “He’s found a really good routine,” an insider said. “He’s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.”  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus. Gal/BACKGRID  Days before Garner and the children arrived in Hawaii, Affleck’s girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, also visited him.  Sources have said the two are in a committed relationship but taking it slow.  “Ben is in a very committed relationship with Lindsey Shook us and they too work hard to balance time between work, friends and their families,” says the source close to Affleck.  On Wednesday night, Garner was spotted out in N.Y.C. looking relaxed and happy. The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladurée.  Garner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who’s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. “As long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,” another insider said. “She will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.”  RELATED: Jennifer Garner and Kids Visit Ben Affleck in Hawaii for Easter Weekend  The actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles. Affleck has his eye on the space that boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms along with a screening room, gym, family room and maid’s room as well as a backyard with pool, spa, outdoor BBQ and guest house.  This comes months after the father of three was first spotted house hunting with Shookus.  “Ben is looking to buy a family friendly house,” a source previously told PEOPLE in October 2017. “Lindsay shared her opinions, but it was clear that they are not buying a house together.”  Affleck had been living in a rental since he moved out of the family estate he used to share with Garner. Prior to their divorce filing last April, he was living in the family’s guesthouse.	1
Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux shocked the world when they announced their split in February 2018. After seven years as a couple and two and a half years of marriage, we thought they finally got their happy ending.  Although they promised to “[continue] their cherished friendship” in the separation statement they released, we’re not so sure that’s the case anymore. Dark secrets have been revealed surrounding their divorce, including what they’re fighting over (page 6) and why Theroux’s rumored relationship with Selena Gomez is so messed up (page 8).  1. There were warning signs of their divorce  The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images  Looking back, maybe Aniston and Theroux’s divorce isn’t so surprising after all. As it turns out, there were some obvious warning signs leading up to their announcement.  Aniston was attending parties left and right without her husband, from her Friends co-star Courtney Cox’s birthday celebration in Malibu to Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding.  Theroux didn’t post any birthday wishes to Aniston on Feb. 11, 2018 — just four days before their separation announcement — whereas they’d typically share sweet messages on each other’s birthday.  Next: It’s been going on for a while.  2. They went through ‘intense issues’ for almost a year  Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images  According to E! News, Aniston and Theroux had been unhappy for quite some time. A source revealed that by the time of their split, they’d actually “been separated for two months.”  However, they “were having intense issues for about eight months.”  Next: They may not have ever been meant to be.  3. Their lifestyles were completely different  She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux seemed perfect for each other, but their lifestyles just weren’t compatible. E! News reported that Theroux prefered keeping a low profile, which just wasn’t possible when married to a Hollywood A-lister like Aniston.  A source confirmed, “Jennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.”    The source added, “The initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.”  Next: This played a major role in their split.  4. They couldn’t agree on where to live  He didn’t want to give up living in New York. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images He didn’t want to give up living in New York. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images  The couple’s different ideas on where to live reportedly became a major force in leading to their split. Aniston feels at home in Los Angeles, while Theroux wasn’t ready to give up his life in New York. A source told Entertainment Tonight, “[Theroux] much prefers being [in New York] and that’s been a major issue for them for a long time.”  While they reportedly tried giving New York a try, “she just never really could get settled in, she wasn’t happy.”  Next: You won’t believe what Theroux found.  5. Theroux found old love notes from Pitt  She kept notes from Brad Pitt. | Ucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images She kept notes from Brad Pitt. | Ucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images  For those of you hoping for Aniston to reunite with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, you may swoon over the fact that she kept old post-it notes with sweet messages from him all these years. Theroux, however, was unsurprisingly upset upon finding her keepsake collection.  A source told Us Weekly that when Theroux “stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” the impact was “huge.”  “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already,’” were among the love notes Theroux uncovered. His discovery left him with insecurities, which could have ultimately played a huge part in their split.  Next: They’ve been fighting over this since their split.  6. They’re fighting over the custody of their dogs  Neither wants to give up the dogs. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images Neither wants to give up the dogs. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux may have split amicably, but they don’t seem to be on the greatest terms anymore. The cause? The fight over the custody of their four dogs.  A source told Radar Online, “The custody of the dogs is a massive sticking point in their divorce agreement!”  Next: Theroux may have moved on with this celebrity.  7. Theroux is reportedly seeing Selena Gomez  Selena Gomez is 21 years younger than Theroux. | Selena Gomez is 21 years younger than Theroux. | Selena Gomez via Instagram  Rumors have begun circulating that Theroux has moved on from Aniston with Selena Gomez — who is 21 years his junior. According to Cosmopolitan, a source claimed, “Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups. It’s turned into something more than friendship.”  Next: Here’s why their rumored relationship is so messed up.  8. Gomez and Aniston are apparently super close  Jennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez are good friends. | Michael Buckner/Getty Images for InStyle Jennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez are good friends. | Michael Buckner/Getty Images for InStyle  Aniston clearly isn’t happy with Theroux’s apparent relationship with Gomez. She and Gomez have boasted about their friendship in the past, making this romance rumor particularly shady.  A source told The Sun, “Jennifer called her to ask why she had been hanging out with Justin, because she felt betrayed.”  “She has been close to Selena for a few years and has taken her under her wing,” the source added. “But Jen has clearly been offended, which really affected Selena.”  Check out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!	1
"Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.  But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.  Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.  Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.  Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.  One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""  She certainly takes vigorous exercise.  Exercising more than is healthy  As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.  Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.  Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.  Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.  The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.  She is, then, clinically underweight.  Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.  Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.  Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""  Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.  But Valentino says her figure is perfect  Miss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.  (""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)  Her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.  In media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.  But the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?  And why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?  And why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a £10million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?  There are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.  She is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.  Her romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.  How painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.  Overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage  She was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.  Those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.  ""I don't think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.  I was desperate to have a baby with Tom  ""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That's what I wish I'd done.""  Her vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life.  Furthermore, she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected, depressed and oppressed women - with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent.  In an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours, because she feared the effect on her own state of mind.  ""I wasn't sure I could go through with it. Virginia Woolf's unhappiness was just too similar to my own.  Hesitated to play suicidal Virginia Woolf  ""I was afraid to do it because I thought it would be too painful,"" she said.  ""But I think characters come into your life sometimes because they're meant to ... I was able to use her and her knowledge.""  There are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of Stepford Wives in New York.  The crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine.  Her representatives say this is utter nonsense. ""No one is more professional than Nicole,"" they aver, sternly.  But whatever the truth of those reports, one does wonder whether the film - a remake of the Seventies classic, about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots - has uncomfortable resonances for Nicole, whose Catholic beliefs were put aside by her Scientologist husband, and who, during her marriage, lost her identity in his.  What she yearns for is love - the love she gave to Cruise and which she still feels for him.  She yearns for love  ""I've said to Tom, I will be there for him for the rest of his life, always,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Tom and I had 11 years together. Your heart has to stay loving.""  She surprised everyone by admitting at the Cannes Film Festival that she would give up her career for love.  ""I won't do this for the rest of my life, there's other things that interest me,' she said.  ""I think when I fall in love, I'll stop doing as much of this because I want to settle down again.""  What she has experienced since then, though, are little more than dangerous flirtations.  Q-Tip, her escort at the premiere of The Hours, appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be.  Kravitz, meanwhile, took her to Puff Daddy's birthday party - again an event which would be anathema to strait-laced Cruise. In private, Nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to ""make it up to them"" - she feels immensely guilty about the divorce.  She also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation.  She is unhappily single  The Jude Law episode - when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage - was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another woman's husband.  Their meetings on both sides of the Atlantic were professional. In short, she remains steadfastly but unhappily single.  What a pity, for this is surely the golden period in Nicole's professional life. She took the Best Actress Oscar this spring for The Hours.  Later this year Cold Mountain, the Civil War epic directed by Anthony Minghella, will be released, and there is already an Oscar buzz forming about this bleak film.  Also later this year she will be seen in The Human Stain, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Then there is Birth, a film about a grieving widow, which she made early this year, and after that Stepford Wives, scheduled for release next year.  Because of delays in filming Stepford Wives, she has had to pull out of the Venice Film Festival, and because of the promotional schedule of Cold Mountain she has had to pull out of Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Pitt.  Her diary is indeed creaking at the seams. And she is determined to make the most of her status while she can, despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough.  ""There was a time when part of me didn't really want to take on too many projects because I had other priorities like my marriage and my family,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Now I feel more confident. Also I find with two children that are older, that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films.  ""They don't need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father.  ""In any case I'm a pragmatist, and I won't always be offered these opportunities. Work while you can, I say.""  She is living very much the burnout life which she described in Cannes this year, travelling constantly and working hard.  Burnout lifestyle  ""You give so much of yourself and you've got to step away at some stage. You can't do it for ever,"" she said.  Could it be that the worryingly slight figure that emerged this week is evidence she is reaching the point of no return?"	1
“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, “Don’t talk about guns.”  Colbert closed out The Late Show ’s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: “Doing nothing is cowardice.” he said. “You want to make America great again?

Netflix’s newest dark comedy, Insatiable, is being accused of fat-shaming — but star Alyssa Milano insists the show is actually tackling the topic head-on.  The series follows former Disney darling Debby Ryan as a high school student named Patty who was bullied relentlessly about her weight. After an incident leads to her jaw being wired shut over the summer, Patty shows up for the first day of her senior year looking rather different — and thirsty for revenge against anyone who was mean to her.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  After the new trailer was released on Thursday, the show faced significant backlash, with critics accusing the show of fat-shaming and calling it “disgusting,” “lazy” and “toxic.”  Milano, who plays the wife of Patty’s lawyer, tweeted that the show hopes to confront the issue of bullying, not create more of it.  “We are not shaming Patty,” she writes. “We are addressing (through comedy) the damage that occurs from fat shaming. I hope that clears it up.”  Eliza Morse/Netflix  We are not shaming Patty. We are addressing (through comedy) the damage that occurs from fat shaming. I hope that clears it up. Also, this article does a good job of explaining it more: https://t.co/WoR8R7TjqR #Insatiable https://t.co/GFkDdsn1uh — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) July 19, 2018  She then refers to an article in Teen Vogue about the show.  Ryan hasn’t addressed the backlash directly, but she too pointed her Twitter followers to the Teen Vogue article and posted a screenshot of a highlighted section that reads: “When she returns to school, everyone’s stunned by her physical change. Problematic? You bet. After all, if someone’s treatment of you is rooted in how your body looks, that says a lot about them, not you. Attuned to that, Patty sets out on a quest to make everyone pay for how they treated her (even if you really should just let karma deal with the wrongdoers in its good, sweet time).”  Tina Rowden/Netflix  The show’s writer and executive producer, Lauren Gussis, describes Patty as inspired by her own “formerly bullied teenager.”  “I really felt like it was important to look at [bullying] head on and talk about it,” Gussis tells Teen Vogue. “I’m hoping that if I’m gonna lay out all of my pain for humor, that I’m gonna make at least one person feel less alone. Hopefully a lot of people through the laughter will be like, ‘Oh my God, I’m laughing because I relate. I’m not laughing at, I’m laughing with.'”  Insatiable premieres on Netflix on Aug. 10.	0
"Ed Sheeran revealed why Beyoncé has not been answering your emails: He says the ""Lemonade"" singer changes her email address every week.  On Friday, while at Jingle Ball in Inglewood, California, Sheeran told ET how he pulled off recording his new single, ""Perfect Duet,"" with Beyoncé.  ""I have an email address I email [to get in touch with Beyoncé],"" he said. Then he pointed out that Beyoncé's email address ""actually changes every week.""  Sheeran said he reached out to her via email and started working on the song in May, but it took a few months to finish the track, which finally dropped on Thursday.  ""Obviously she had twins [in June], and we finished [the song] in September, so I've been holding onto it since then,"" he said of the ""Perfect"" remix.  Speaking of ""Perfect,"" Sheeran added that Beyoncé only needed one take to record the song. Sheeran also said Beyoncé had some notes for him.  ""The original version of 'Perfect' was just an acoustic guitar,"" before more instruments were added, he explained. ""[Beyoncé] rung me up and was like, 'I don't know how you feel about this but I've taken all the instruments off it and it's just gonna be acoustic guitar,' and I was like, 'Ah that's great, because it used to be that!'""  ""Then when we got in together, it wasn't so much notes, it was very much like a back-and-forth thing, like, 'What'd you think of this?' Or, 'What do you think of this?' And [we were] probably in the studio for four hours.""  Once Beyoncé began recording, it was smooth sailing.  ""She was just like, 'Right!' Went in, one take, came out, like, 'Yeah, that sounds all right!'"" said Sheeran. See more of Sheeran's interview on ET."	0
"Singer Aaron Carter, who has previously been forthcoming about his substance abuse and eating disorder, is now opening up about his sexuality.  The 29-year-old brother of Backstreet Boys alum Nick Carter tweeted on Saturday night a long open letter in which he acknowledges his attraction to both men and women since he was 13.  ""There’s something I’d like to say that I feel is important for myself and my identity that has been weighing on my chest for nearly half of my life,"" he wrote. ""This doesn’t bring me shame, just a weight and burden I have held onto for a long time that I would like lifted off me.""  He explains, ""I grew up in this entertainment industry at a very young age and when I was around 13 years old I started to find boys and girls attractive.""  He then reveals, ""There were years that went by that I thought about, but it wasn’t until I was 17 years old, after a few relationships with girls, I had an experience with a male that I had an attraction to who I also worked with and grew up with.""  Carter continues, ""To me music has always been my temple. Music will ALWAYS be what transcends us and myself. The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment.""  A Tampa, Florida, native, he ends the letter with a quote from singer Boy George, who also has been open in discussing his sexuality.  ""The best quote to sum 'I've never felt as though I didn't belong, I just acted as though I did.' — Boy George""  Carter's tweet follows his July 15 arrest in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the passenger seat of the car and was also taken into police custody. Carter was released after posting bail for $4,610."	0
It took them two years, a superhero franchise and a countless trips to the Brentwood farmer’s market, but Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have officially filed for divorce.  The couple apparently coordinated their filing sans lawyers, according to TMZ, which was first to break the news, with Garner sending her court papers in Thursday and Affleck responding shortly after.  The two are seeking joint legal and physical custody of their children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 4, so it looks like they’re avoiding a Brangelina-style situation entirely.  The decision to officially divorce comes amid speculation that the former Hollywood golden twosome were reconciling, as the two have continued to act very much like a couple (going on vacations together, praising each other in the press and co-parenting their children) since announcing their split in June 2015.  But according to sources per People magazine, Garner and Affleck have taken their sweet time to iron out the details, like division of property and assets, as well as spousal support, since they do not have a prenuptial agreement.  The two reportedly remain “super amicable” and have done everything with their children in mind.  “They always planned to divorce despite what people said. If you look at their first statement it says divorce, not separate,” a source told the magazine. “They just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.”	1
"This article is about the American television show. For other uses, see Fear factor (disambiguation)  Fear Factor is an American stunt/dare game show that originally aired on NBC from 2001 to 2006. It was later revived by NBC in 2011, only to be cancelled again in 2012. The show was revived a second time in 2017 to air on MTV. The original Dutch version was called Now or Neverland. When Endemol USA and NBC adapted it to the American market in 2001, they changed the name to Fear Factor. The show pits contestants against each other in a variety of stunts for a grand prize, usually of US $50,000. From seasons one to five, the contestants were generally three men and three women, all competing for themselves, but in season six, the show moved to a permanent format of four teams of two people, each with a pre-existing relationship with one another. The show was originally hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan, produced by Matt Kunitz and David A. Hurwitz, and directed by J. Rupert Thompson. Rapper/actor Ludacris took over as host when the show was rebooted in 2017.  History [ edit ]  As NBC's answer to the successful series Survivor, the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001, and built strong ratings and popularity for the next couple of seasons. Joe Rogan, then known for his role on the sitcom NewsRadio (1995-1999) and as a commentator for Ultimate Fighting Championship was hired as the host. According to a 2015 interview with Art Bell, Rogan expected Fear Factor would be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections with some of the content and further reported that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career.[2]  The series had a runaway success during the first few seasons, but after the series' fourth season, the popularity and ratings for Fear Factor began to decline. By 2006, when Fear Factor was in its six season, the ratings for the series were in steep decline as a result of content concerns and a growing loss of viewer interest, coupled with the series facing tough competition with other TV shows in the same time slot. As a result, the series was only averaging a 2.6 in the ratings. [3][4] Later that year, Fear Factor faced tough competition with the TV ratings champion, Fox's talent series American Idol on Tuesday nights, and the ratings declined further, and continued to trend further downward during this period. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, the series' ratings continued to drop and consequently, NBC put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom Joey, which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. After a continuous and steep drop in the series' ratings, it was officially cancelled by NBC in May 2006 after six seasons and the network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be aired throughout the summer, with its last episode airing on September 12, 2006. In 2004, Fear Factor became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, Fear Factor earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD, but in early 2009, plans were made to release a box set containing the entire series on DVD. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010. On June 5, 2010, it was announced that the project was cancelled because of the low sales of the first season DVD.  With Chiller airing reruns of the show every Sunday night, the ratings on Chiller led to Comcast informing Entertainment Weekly in a May 31, 2011 report that Fear Factor would be revived for a new season. Eight episodes were ordered, with two of them being two-hour episodes and Rogan returning to the hosting duties.[5][6] The revival was shot in high-definition, and owing to concerns over the then-ongoing NFL Lockout and the loss of NBC Sunday Night Football episodes, TV Guide reported in early July the show could be ready as early as September as lockout replacement programming.[7] (NBC eventually lost one episode, the season premiere Hall of Fame Game, because of the lockout that ended in late July.) The program began airing December 12, 2011,[8] with the final episode airing July 16, 2012. On May 13, 2012, NBC announced that Fear Factor was officially cancelled.[9]  In April 2017, MTV announced that it would be reviving Fear Factor a second time for 12-episode season. The first season of MTV's Fear Factor premiered on May 30, 2017 and concluded on August 22, 2017. Just prior to the first-season finale, it was announced that MTV had renewed the series for a second season consisting of 20 episodes.[10] The second season, subtitled Season From Hell, began airing on February 25, 2018.[11] The MTV revival is hosted by Ludacris and continues to use the format of four teams competing for a $50,000 prize. The stunts draw inspiration from elements of pop culture, such as horror movies, urban legends, and viral videos.[12]  In addition to Chiller, reruns of Fear Factor have aired in syndication, on FX and MTV2. The series also has a YouTube channel, where previously unaired footage is shown.  Original format (2001–06) [ edit ]  Before the contestants are introduced (and at the half-way point of a two-hour special), Rogan gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one most commonly used:  “ I'm Joe Rogan, and this is Fear Factor. The stunts you're about to see were all designed and supervised by trained professionals. They are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime. ”  Before Rogan gives a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:  “ Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality. Welcome to Fear Factor. Each shows, six contestants from around the country battle each other in three extreme stunts. These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically and mentally. If the contestant is too afraid to complete a stunt, they're eliminated. If they fail a stunt, they're eliminated. But if they succeed, they will be one step closer to the grand prize, $50,000. ”  The normal format involves three men and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional stunts to win US$50,000. Rogan noted that the stunts that not only test any contestants/teams physically, but mentally as well. If a contestant/team is too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt, or (in some cases) had the worst performance on a stunt, they are eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completes the first or the second stunt, they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt along with the winner of the stunt return for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination stunts). The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the stunt, then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.  Only once in the history of Fear Factor did the $50,000 top prize go unclaimed in an episode. This happened on a Best Friends edition on September 27, 2004, when none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won. However, the last remaining contestants walked away with two Mazda vehicles for winning a previous stunt (see Second stunt).  After the acquisition of Universal Studios of Vivendi by NBC's parent company General Electric in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of NBCUniversal at Universal Orlando, or win trips to Universal Studios in Hollywood.  The order of the stunts on a typical episode of Fear Factor is as follows:  First stunt: The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated.  Second stunt: The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entail retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard) or live animals. Less often, the second stunt involves a pain endurance challenge or embarrassment tolerance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a tear gas chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, getting a tattoo, having their head shaved, getting piercings, or ingesting habanero peppers. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they fail to complete it or vomit before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for having the worst performance. In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value. More often than not, the contestant/team with the best performance had the privilege of choosing the order that the contestants/teams had to go in to perform the next stunt [for the following day].  Third stunt: The third and final stunt is usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an action film. Like the first stunt, it usually involves heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt is always competitive. The player or team with the best performance this round wins the grand prize, usually $50,000, and has the privilege of being informed by Rogan that ""evidently, fear is not a factor for you"".  Special formats [ edit ]  Four Stunt Show [ edit ]  This was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in Season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving body piercing. In Seasons 4 to 6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In Season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.  Extended competitions [ edit ]  Some Fear Factor competitions consisted of five or more stunts and featured an increased grand prize. These competitions were always presented as multi-part episodes or single two-hour episodes. The first such competitions were the Tournaments of Champions in Seasons 2 and 3 (see below). Season 4 included a two-hour season premiere in which twelve contestants competed in six stunts for a grand prize of $1,000,000; and a two-part, six-stunt Las Vegas episode where the winner would have a chance to win up to $100,000 based on his or her performance in the final stunt (they would then have to bet half their winnings on a hand of blackjack). Season 6 featured two three-episode, six-stunt competitions (""Psycho Fear Factor"" and ""Reality Stars Fear Factor""). Season 7 included two five-stunt competitions in which five teams competed for a grand prize of $100,000; the first aired as a single two-hour episode, and the second aired in two parts.  Tournament of Champions: The second and third seasons concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each show in that season and a $100,000 grand prize. In Season two, the thirteen non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first four stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women, in two stunts each. The men had to release a flag from a locked box while hanging suspended in the air and eat three different items from a table. The women had to collect flags while on top of an aircraft and retrieve three poles from a tank with alligators. The stunts narrowed the contestants down from eight men and five women to two men and two women who will, in the end, compete against each other for the grand prize by using a key to activate a horn while riding on a speeding truck. In Season three, the twenty-four winners were divided into two groups of twelve, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt, and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 Mazda RX-8 and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant, and the final stunt determined the winner.  Couples Fear Factor: Seasons 4 and 5 both included Couples Fear Factor competitions that played out over seven episodes and featured a grand prize of $1,000,000. Nine couples competed in 17 stunts in Season 4, and eight couples competed in 14 stunts in Season 5. In Season 4, each episode contained two or three stunts, with at least one stunt being a non-elimination stunt. In Season 5, each episode featured two stunts; the first was always a non-elimination stunt, and the second usually eliminated the team with the worst performance. In contrast to the regular format, only one team was eliminated in each elimination stunt; if multiple teams failed the stunt, then the teams that succeeded would vote on which failing team to eliminate. Almost every stunt offered a prize (e.g., cars, vacations, pre-loaded credit cards, a chance to steal a desired prize from another team) or a $10,000 incentive to the team with the best performance. Couples Fear Factor episodes had certain stylistic differences from the regular format, including a different opening sequence, and onscreen interviews with the contestants (regular episodes usually presented interviews in voiceover format only).  Psycho Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which six couples competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $250,000. The stunts were centered around the Bates Motel on the set of the original Psycho horror movie from Paramount Pictures. Unlike other Fear Factor episodes, contestants were required to sleep in the filthy Bates Motel between stunts and were subjected to Fear Factor pranks and mini-challenges while in the motel.  Reality Stars Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which five teams of Reality TV stars competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $150,000. The series featured teams from The Amazing Race, Survivor, American Idol, The Apprentice, and The Real World.  Other formats [ edit ]  Celebrity special (Seasons two, three, and six): In Seasons 2 and 3, episodes with celebrity contestants were played in the normal format, except that contestants were playing for charity. The winning contestant's charity would receive $50,000, and other contestants' charities would receive a lesser amount ($10,000 or $25,000). In Season 6, eight celebrity contestants paired up into teams of two for the first two stunts but competed individually in the final stunt. Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Richardson and Alan Thicke are among the celebrities who have competed on Fear Factor.[13] Season 2 included an episode featuring six WWF/E stars; it was won by Matt Hardy.  All-Gross Show (Seasons three to six): All three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved bobbing for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow blood. In seasons four and five, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season six, a ""Farm Fear Factor"" episode featured all gross stunts.  Mixed Team and Individual Stunts (Seasons two, five, and six): In most episodes, contestants competed individually or in teams of two for the entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second stunt but competed individually in the final stunt. The first instance of this was a Season 2 episode in which three pairs of twins competed as teams in the first stunt, and competed individually the second and third stunts. In Season 5's ""New York vs. L.A."" episode, the first stunt narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second stunt, and all contestants competed as individuals in the final stunt. A Season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two stunts and individually in the final stunt. In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the stunts alone if their partner quit before the stunt started.  Holiday specials (Seasons three to five): Over the course of the series, Fear Factor produced three Christmas episodes, two Halloween episodes, and a Thanksgiving episode. The Christmas episodes featured Christmas-themed stunts but were otherwise played in the normal format. The Halloween episodes followed the all-gross format, and the Thanksgiving episode followed the four-stunt format.  Las Vegas Show (Seasons three to five): Stunts took place at various hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. The show's winner was required to bet at least half of their winnings on one hand of Blackjack, with the chance to continue gambling if successful.  Special Contestants (Seasons two to seven): Some episodes featured a specific type of contestant (e.g., models, all-female, twins, military members, reality TV stars, freaks and geeks, young and old, returning contestants) or teams with a specific type of relationship (e.g., couples, newlyweds, siblings, best friends, parent/child teams, exes). Many of these episodes were played in the regular format, although some used a four-stunt or extended competition format.  Fear Factor Super Bowl Halftime Show (Season two): Played in the normal format with Playboy Playmates. The first stunt aired as counter programming to the Super Bowl halftime show and ended right before the third quarter of the game started. The remaining two stunts were shown immediately after the game as counter programming to the Super Bowl lead-out show.  Miss USA (Seasons three to five): Played in the normal format with Miss USA contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of Fear Factor, as NBC produced a Miss USA edition of Deal or No Deal instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode. The next time that Miss USA delegates would be involved in a game show was in 2010 on Minute to Win It. The Miss USA edition was not present in the show's final two seasons, as the current format had four teams of two people.  Blind Date (Season six): Four single men were introduced to four single women, and either the women (in the first episode) or the men (in the second episode) got to choose their partner among the available contestants of the opposite sex. The game was then played in the regular format, with the winning team dividing the prize.  Sleep Deprivation (Season four): Five co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants had to stay awake for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the TV series in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.[citation needed]  Million Dollar Heist: (Season six): Played in the regular teams format, but instead of competing for the normal $50,000 prize, teams would race head-to-head to ""steal"" up to $1,000,000 worth of gold from an armored truck submerged in water for their final stunt. The team that ""stole"" the most money's worth of gold within the time limit would win the combined amount of money collected by both teams.  Home Invasion: This short segment was included at the end of each episode in Season six. It involved Joe Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging a family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants, under time limit (usually one minute), ingesting or bobbing in something foul or undesirable. If successful, the family would win up to $5,000 in the form of pre-loaded credit cards from Capital One.  Revived series (2011–12) [ edit ]  The series revival began airing on December 12, 2011, and the two premiere episodes were viewed by 8.7 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively.[14] This makes the premiere the highest non-sports programming to air on NBC at 8:00 p.m. since February 2008. Following Rogan's word for a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:  “ It all began ten years ago, at the dawn of reality television. Audiences had never seen anything like it. Now, the legend begins all over again. It's bigger, better and more intense than ever before. Welcome back to Fear Factor. ”  The revival featured four teams of two people with a preexisting relationship per episode, rather than the original versions' six people (three males and three females). The first five seasons had typically used the three male, three female grouping, but the sixth and final pre-revival season always utilized 4 teams of two people each. The stunts have remained basically the same, with the ""gross"" one in between the two physical ones.  NBC pulled a two-hour, five team, five stunt episode entitled ""Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!"" which featured a stunt where teams spun a wheel to determine whether they would have to shave their heads and eyebrows, get tattooed, or be tear gassed. This episode was scheduled to air in two parts on January 23 and 30, 2012, but it was postponed after Part 1 was replaced by a GOP debate.  Another episode, entitled ""Hee Haw! Hee Haw!"" and featuring a stunt where contestants drink the urine and semen of a donkey, was then scheduled to air January 30, 2012. Hesitant about airing the stunt, NBC eventually pulled the episode after pictures of the stunt appeared online. Video footage of the stunt appeared online after the episode aired on Danish TV in June 2012,[15] and Fear Factor eventually posted short clips of all three stunts on their YouTube channel in July 2014.[16][17][18]  The sixth episode, entitled ""The Bees Are So Angry"", was two hours instead of the usual one, and included five teams, five stunts, and a $100,000 prize instead of the usual four teams, three stunts, and $50,000 prize. Following this episode, The Voice replaced the series' slot on Monday nights.  NBC rescheduled the two hour ""Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!"" episode, which aired in two parts over the nights of July 9 and July 16. The first part ended with the ""To Be Continued"" subtitle followed by a preview for the second part. As of July 2012, Fear Factor was officially cancelled.

MTV format (2017–present) [ edit ]  MTV's Fear Factor revival continues to use the format of four teams of two people competing in three challenges for a $50,000 grand prize, as in Seasons 6 and 7 of the NBC series. As the show started, Ludacris gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one commonly used:  “ The challenges you are about to see were designed and tested by trained professionals. They are extremely ludicrous and should never be attempted by anyone, anywhere, or at anytime. This is MTV's Fear Factor. ”  However, the order of the stunts, as well as some of the rules, differ from the original format. Each episode of the MTV version has three named rounds: Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear, and The Final Fear.  Beat the Beast: This stunt challenges the contestants to conquer their fear of something creepy (usually live creatures considered gross or intimidating) and generally follows the same format as animal stunts from the second stunt of the original version. The team with the best performance in this round wins a ""FearVantage"", which is an advantage in the next round (such as picking the order).  Face Your Fear: This is a challenge tailored to a common fear shared by all of the contestants on a particular episode. The nature of this stunt varies widely depending on the fears of the contestants.  The Final Fear: This is an extreme physical stunt that follows the same format as the first and third stunts from the original version of the show. The team with the best performance wins the $50,000 grand prize.  International versions [ edit ]  Criticism [ edit ]  Fear Factor has received criticism from the general public mainly because of the show's second stunt, which intends to disgust its viewers. The American Humane Association expressed concerns for allowing various animals to get injured, and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional animal trainers have refused to work on the show because the producers of Fear Factor have demanded stunts which violate the association's guidelines.  American Humane believes that shows like Fear Factor are on a slippery slope of animal mistreatment and provide poor examples of animal treatment and humane ethics. As we work diligently to expand voluntary compliance with animal safety guidelines, organisations like Endemol who blatantly demonstrate complete disregard for animal welfare, or even that of their human contestants — are producing unacceptable programming. Karen Rosa (Communications Manager of AHA Film and TV Unit)[35][citation needed]  In January 2005, an episode featuring a stunt involving blended rats aired in its normal prime time slot. Austin Aitken, a part-time paralegal from Cleveland, Ohio, sued NBC for $2.5 million USD for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his blood pressure rose until he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. He claimed that his disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. In March 2005, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of First Amendment protection.[36]  Fear Factor was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with ""electrified wires"" replete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing. The Edison Electric Institute issued a warning regarding the episode, fearing that viewers might attempt to climb through a real substation with potentially fatal results.[37]  An episode originally scheduled for January 30, 2012, featuring contestants drinking donkey semen and urine, was rejected by NBC, which instead aired a rerun.[38] On January 31, 2012, two of the contestants, twin sisters Claire and Brynne Odioso, appeared on The Cowhead Show on Tampa Bay radio station WHPT to talk about their experiences in that episode; however, according to TMZ.com, producers of Fear Factor warned the Odioso sisters not to continue any discussion of the program, as doing so would put them in breach of their confidentiality agreements.[39]  Spin-off products [ edit ]  Fear Factor has also resulted in various spin-off products:"	0

Although Rihanna and Hassan Jameel just spent Grammys night together, they’re working through some things from her past. He is feeling ‘tense’ over her ex, Chris Brown!  Despite keeping their relationship super private, Rihanna, 29, and Hassan Jameel, stepped out on Grammys night, proving they’re still going strong. However, Hassan — a billionaire businessman and Toyota heir — is stressing over RiRi’s ex, Chris Brown, 28. “He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past,” a source close to Rihanna tells HollywoodLife.com. As previously reported, Chris has been keeping a close eye on his ex and her new man, as he’s been known to have lingering feelings from their past romance. With that being said, “Hassan doesn’t trust Chris and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.”  Although the insider says Rihanna has opened up to Hassan about her relationship with Chris and assured him that that’s all part of her past, Hassan isn’t entirely convinced. “He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy,” the source admits. “Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.”  Rihanna and Hassan have yet to confirm their relationship since they were first romantically linked in June 2017. The pair were photographed in each other’s arms amidst a make-out session at a private villa in Spain. However, both RiRi and Hassan have kept things under wraps, only stepping out separately and never being photographed in the same shot. The two were spotted dining at the same London restaurant in September 2017, and then they travel to Boston in October of that year.  The rumored new couple attended hit the same Grammy afterparty at 1Oak Nightclub in New York City on Sunday, where they were photographed leaving separately. But, RiRi excited the club shortly after Hassan had left.  Hassan’s worries over Chris come at the same time reports claim the singer is dating Indonesian singer/songwriter, Agnez Mo. Chris and Mo have been fueling the romance rumors, posting flirty photos together and stepped out together. They were most recently spotted holding hands during a Disneyland date over the January 6/7 weekend.  HollywoodLifers, who would you like to see Rihanna date?	1

"The fashion crowd is speaking out about Kim Kardashian's robbery in Paris, and they seem to be blaming the 35-year-old reality TV star for the crime.  According to The Hollywood Reporter, attendees at Paris Fashion Week were less than sympathetic after Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in her hotel room early Monday morning.  ""Well, she should stop Instagramming pictures of herself in her hotel bathroom,"" an American magazine contributor told The Hollywood Reporter.  Another American fashion editor joked, ""She was probably drunk after the L’Oreal party and let them in accidentally. Or she tagged herself there. Criminals can have Instagram too."" (Note: Kardashian famously does not drink.)  And some just questioned the entire ordeal, with a British journalist asking, ""Where did they get a gun? Sounds fake.""  💎💎💎 A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 29, 2016 at 12:40pm PDT  Yahoo Style also overheard one editor at a show expressing little surprise at the incident.  “That’s what happens when you invite cameras around every time you go shopping for more designer stuff.”  Kim Kardashian attends the Givenchy show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2017 on Oct. 2, 2016 in Paris.  According to E! News, Kim was ""gagged and bound at her hands and feet, then handcuffed at gunpoint"" Monday morning. Five men left her tied up in a bathroom before stealing over US$10 million worth of jewelry.  ""She begged for them to let her live and [said] she had babies at home. Then they wrapped her mouth in tape and put her in the bathtub,"" the source told E! News. ""She thought they were for sure going to kill her.""  French police officers stand in front of Kim Kardashian's luxury apartment Hotel de Pourtales on Rue Tronchet in the 8th arrondissement, where she was robbed at gunpoint by masked men during a visit to the French capital to attend Paris Fashion Week, on Oct. 3, 2016.  TMZ reports the mother of North and Saint West was ""lying in bed with only her robe on when she heard boots pounding up the stairs of her two-storey apartment."" She reportedly saw a masked man and another wearing a police hat through the glass sliding door, and tried calling her bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, on her cell phone, but the phone was ripped out of her hands by one of the men before she could finish dialing.  Kim told cops she believed she was going to be raped when one of the men grabbed her by her ankles. She also said the men were after the new ring she got from husband Kanye West.  GIVENCHY COUTURE A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 1, 2016 at 9:40am PDT    TMZ also reports Kim's friend, Simone Harouche, was in the downstairs bedroom of the apartment, and locked herself in the bathroom, calling Duvier and Kim's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, telling them to hurry back.  The entire incident supposedly took six minutes, with Duvier arriving two minutes after the robbers left. Kim fled Paris after talking to the police.  Kanye was performing at the Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York during the incident. He ended his set abruptly, in the middle of performing ""Heartless,"" telling concert-goers he had a family emergency. He has since rescheduled his two upcoming shows for his Saint Pablo tour that were originally scheduled for Oct. 4 and Oct. 6.  this is a video of Kanye West starting Heartless then leaving @themeadowsnyc abruptly pic.twitter.com/2sPgj6LczW — Jenna (@chickenCARM_) October 3, 2016    North and Saint were in New York at the time of the robbery, according to ET.

Gwen Stefani is having a hard-time selling the mega mansion she shared with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale — possibly because it’s not for the faint of heart (or the shallow of wallet).  Simon Berlyn  According to Variety, the former couple purchased the 11,845-square-foot Beverly Hills estate for $13.25 million in 2006 and listed it in 2016 for $35 million following their divorce. Stefani dropped the asking price to $29 million earlier this year.  Simon Berlyn  Designer Kelly Wearstler lent her trademark glam to the 10-bedroom house, which is a whirlwind of marble facades, graphic patterns, and neon colors. The decor ranges from Hollywood regency to space age to ultra modern. Floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto the San Fenando valley, and vaulted ceilings, skylights, and hardwood flooring complete the package.  Simon Berlyn  Six of the bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, and the master bedroom boasts a walk-in closet with chic carpeting and wood paneling. The black-and-white striped kitchen is a true show stopper though, with hidden storage space and an adjoining breakfast room with a built-in leather banquette.  Jennifer Lopez also once owned the estate, which checks off the necessary criteria of a celebrity home in Cali: a home gym and screening room, thick hedges shielding the pool from view, a 250-foot private driveway, and a gated entry to keep the paps at bay.  Simon Berlyn  The backyard area is also nicer than most tropical resorts, complete with an infinity pool, a full tennis court, chicken coop, detached guest house, and a playground for Stefani’s children. If you need further proof that Stefani lived here, just take in the statement outdoor pizza oven.  Simon Berlyn  Stephen Shapiro of Westside Estate Agency holds the listing.  See more photos below.

Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to comedy legend Don Rickles on Thursday night’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC.  “This is not going to be our usual show tonight,” Kimmel said at the top of his monologue. “And I’ll tell you right up front that I’m going to cry — probably a lot, which is embarrassing. But I’m not good with this sort of thing and I’m sorry — especially to those of you who came here to see the show in person, because that’s probably not what you came for. But we lost someone that we and I love very much today.”  Rickles died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 90.  “I was fortunate enough to — not only have Don on this show as my guest — but also to become close to him and his wife Barbara, which was a lot of fun for me,” Kimmel said.  Kimmel described Rickles as a towering presence in Las Vegas, where Kimmel grew up, and where Rickles found his greatest success as a stand-up comic. He also described the first time Rickles — who rose to fame as a frequent guest on Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show” — appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2006.  “It was so exciting,” Kimmel said. “I felt like I was in some kind of talk show host fantasy camp. Sitting behind a desk while Don Rickles made fun of me. It was like being a real talk show host for a minute. For twenty minutes, it was like being Johnny Carson.”  Rickles appeared on Kimmel’s show 17 times more in the years that followed.  Kimmel also talked about taking Rickles, famous for his insult comedy, out to Mario Batali’s Los Angeles restaurant Mozza. “We rented the private room in back,” Kimmel said. “We had food, I invited his friends — it was beautiful. It was very expensive. At the end of the meal, he said, ‘I can’t believe you took me to a pizza place.'”  Kimmel closed his monologue with a video tribute to Rickles, showing the best moments from the comedian’s appearance on the ABC show.

Praise Themyscira, for new details about the Wonder Woman sequel are finally being released. On Wednesday, director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot both released stills from the upcoming movie, which will be titled, drum roll . . . Wonder Woman 1984, because the film is set during the Cold War. We’ll get to that in a minute. But first, let’s address the biggest reveal from these new stills: Steve Trevor is alive!  Jenkins shared a still of Chris Pine reprising his role as Trevor with this caption: “Welcome to WONDER WOMAN 1984, Steve Trevor! #WW84.” Let it be known that Pine is absolutely working the hell out of that 1980s-inspired wardrobe, wearing an all-black jumpsuit and a pair of worn-in Nike Cortez sneakers. We’ve also got to give it up to the perfectly dressed extras around him, bringing a full 80s mall fantasy to life. Armie Hammer is going to take one look at this still and un-retire his jumpsuit phase.  But now for a more pressing question: how, exactly, is Steve Trevor alive? As you might recall, the first Wonder Woman introduced Trevor as an American spy who teams up with Diana during the first World War. They fall in love, but then Trevor rides off on a heroic suicide mission, sacrificing his life in order to prevent a deadly gas from being used in the war. Considering how popular his character was, Warner Bros. brass probably decided Trevor was too handsome and pure to leave behind for the sequel—implausible though his survival may be.  There are numerous ways Trevor could be brought back for the sequel, per the limitless rules of the comic-book world. Trevor could return as an alternate version of himself—maybe from another dimension?—or maybe he was saved from his original fate through a time jump, as comicbook.com surmises. And as The Hollywood Reporter notes, there are already inconsistencies with Trevor’s timeline in the Wonder Woman comics, due to sporadic relaunches and reboots of the franchise—so there are plenty of possible story lines for Jenkins to borrow for the sequel.  Gadot’s Wonder Woman 1984 reveal, meanwhile, was a bit on the simpler side: just a still of Diana Prince standing in front of an ominous number of TV screens.  Her outfit—what we can see of it, anyway–appears much less retro than Trevor’s, which is probably for the best. Do we want to see Diana Prince in massive shoulder pads? Maybe; maybe not.  Regardless, the vibe of the still is very Big Brother—yet another reminder of the timeliness of George Orwell’s dystopian classic, 1984. (It can be no coincidence that the sequel is set in that very year.) It was reported last year that the film would be set during the Cold War, with Wonder Woman going up against the Soviet Union. So we’ve got villainous Russians, corrupt governments, and the whole 1984 aesthetic to look forward to—nothing particularly timely about that, nope, not at all. Thankfully, some of the film’s potentially maddening relevance will hopefully be offset by Kristen Wiig playing the villainous Cheetah, a casting decision that is both hilarious and deeply perfect. Wonder Woman 1984 is set to hit theaters on Nov. 1, 2019.  Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe	0

"Kate Walsh stars as Rebecca Wright, the eponymous hot mess adjudicator on NBC's new sitcom Bad Judge , premiering this Thursday night... but some of us are still waiting to see the actress pop up on another of our favorite shows. Those hoping Walsh would return to Grey's Anatomy once Private Practice ended its six-season run on ABC were sadly disappointed when Addison Montgomery didn't immediately strut through the doors of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Instead, she recurred in the first season of FX's crime anthology series Fargo as Gina Hess, a widowed trophy wife. And now she's joining her former Grey's costar Katherine Heigl in headlining her own show on the Peacock network. (Heigl stars in the drama State Of Affairs, premiering Nov. 17.)  When Addison left Seattle for her own L.A.-based spinoff, Walsh still made a habit of dropping by Grey's once per season, including in Season 7's musical event, ""Song Beneath The Song."" But the last time Addison was seen in Grey Sloan Memorial was in the Season 8 parallel universe episode ""If/Then,"" where her character merely appeared as a manifestation of Derek's alternate reality. In the two-and-a-half seasons since then, there's been a conspicuous lack of red hair around the hospital.  So should we officially give up hope of ever seeing Dr. Montgomery bickering with Derek and healing babies again? Not so fast. While it seems unlikely that Walsh will ever return to Grey's as a series regular, further guest appearances aren't out of the question. In 2012 the actress told E! that she's always open to returning to her old stomping grounds, schedule permitting, saying ""Of course. I'm open to anything. I'm ready for my next chapter, but never close the door.""  Fans got excited last year when showrunner Shonda Rhimes dropped hints in the run-up to Season 10 that she was interested in revisiting Addison's story, telling The Hollywood Reporter, ""I would love to see Addison back at Seattle Grace at some point for a visit. I've said a million times that before the show ends its run, Addison has got to put on her shoes and scrub cap and come scrub in at the hospital. That's a given for me."" Obviously, the neonatal surgeon didn't end up making it onto the show that season, but with Grey's Anatomy still going strong in its second decade, there's still plenty of time to check in with her before the curtain goes down.  There is at least one hopeful sign pointing to an imminent Walsh appearance. At the same time Rhimes was teasing us with Addison possibilities, she was also thinking about incorporating Derek's sister Amelia (Caterina Scorsone), who had been a regular on Private Practice in Seasons 4-6, into Grey Sloan Memorial. ""Amelia is Derek's sister, and I'm going to want to see that happen at some point as well,"" the executive producer told The Hollywood Reporter. Interestingly, Scorsone just joined Grey's as a series regular for Season 11, which goes to show that Rhimes is very good at getting what she wants.  If Rhimes was able to work her magic on Scorsone, surely she can convince Walsh to return to Grey's as well. I know it's terrible to hope for any show to fail, but the idea of a swift Bad Judge cancellation paving the way for Addison returning to Grey's full-time is too good to resist. She would arrive just in time for the Meredith/Derek drama that's about to go down this season, and what can stir up a troubled marriage more than a beautiful ex-wife?!

TV host Ellen DeGenres’s wife Portia de Rossi has been cutting her wrists to cope with their marital problems, reports aceshowbiz.com.  Ellen with her partner Portia.  Last week, the couple were believed to be on the verge of divorce and jealousy was the cause of the couple’s problems. The two are living separately in California. “Ellen can’t deal when Portia gets attached to anyone else, man or woman. But it works both ways. When Ellen kisses up to her famous friends, Portia becomes consumed with self-doubt,” the source told National Enquirer newspaper.  According to the newspaper, Rossi’s friends suggested her to seek therapy but the “Nip/Tuck” actress was “resisting help.”  “Ellen has been in counselling, both solo and with Portia. Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That’s why they’ve been seen out and about more together lately.

He is a prince raised in London, the son of the first heir to the British throne.  She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director.  But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A genealogical investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found that the famous pair are actually distant cousins, related through a late 15th Century ancestor of the Queen Mother.  Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.

A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?  The news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance.	0
At first glance, one might say that Davidson looks mesmerized by the performance going on in front of him. But his lack of blinking tells me that his mind is most definitely cloudy. It isn’t until the music stops and the crew snaps him back to reality that he has any sort of reaction. Nonetheless, he gets a gold star just for being there. You’ll know you’ve got a keeper when your partner is willing to do whatever they can to be supportive, even when they’re obviously over it and would rather be somewhere else.	0
In a landmark moment, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his brother, Prince Harry, have sat down for on-camera interviews to discuss the aftermath of the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The conversations will air as part of a two-hour documentary, Diana, 7 Days, which will premiere on NBC Friday, Sept. 1 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, the network announced on Thursday.  “Part of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her,” Prince William says in the doc. “I think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn’t protect her. We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was. Do our duties as sons in protecting her.”  Directed by documentarian Henry Singer (9/11: The Falling Man), Diana, 7 Days examines the week between Diana’s death and her funeral. Family members, close friends, political figures, and journalists will be featured, including Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Earl Spencer, and Lady Sarah McCorquodale.  Princess Diana died on Aug. 31, 1997 from injuries sustained in a car crash in France, a loss that rippled throughout the world. HBO recently debuted a documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, which focuses on her presence as a mother and was created with the blessing of her sons.  According to a press release for Diana, 7 Days, Prince William and Prince Harry will share their first reactions to the news of their mother’s death, memories of the public mourning period, their reactions on the day of the funeral, personal memories of their mother, and what she meant to them both then and now.  “When she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking,” Prince Harry says in the documentary. “It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you’re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it’s lodged in here, there, wherever — in your heart, in your head, and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it’s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.”  Diana, 7 Days is executive-produced by Alison Kirkham and Peter Dale for the BBC, and produced by Singer, Jenny Saunders, and Jessica Ludgrove.	0
"Remember earlier this season, when This Is Us made a joke about multiple Kardashian babies, and we had just learned that multiple Kardashians were pregnant? It felt like the show could see into the future, because the reference was just so timely. And now, they’ve done it again — except that this time they’ve had to edit the reference out.  The episode set to air tonight, titled “The 20s,” revolves around a flashback to Halloween of years past. The official synopsis reads: Trick-or-treating with the 10 year olds goes awry for Jack and Rebecca; and Randall, Kevin and Kate have life-changing Halloweens. The episode — which was made available to press ahead of time, and yes, I have watched it — takes us back to a Halloween when the Big Three were 10, and also 18 years later in the year 2008, when they’re all 28.  It’s in this 2008 flashback where we see Kevin struggling as an actor in Los Angeles. During the episode, Kevin’s roommate at the time comes home from a day auditioning and excitedly shares that he’s just booked a role on an upcoming Kevin Spacey movie.  Out of all the actors This Is Us could have picked, they had to go with Kevin Spacey. Back in 2008, the actor had just wrapped a role as Lex Luthor in Superman Returns and was about to star in HBO’s Recount, which earned him an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. So talking about Spacey being an actor everyone wanted to collaborate with isn’t such a far off idea — but 2008 seems like an eon ago.  And now, following allegations that Spacey made sexual advances toward Anthony Rapp when Rapp was a minor (Spacey was 26, Rapp was 14), his prestigious star power has started to fall. TV Line was the first to report this Spacey edit; only one mention was made of Spacey, and it wasn’t a big plot point of the episode. NBC and 20th Century Fox (the production companies behind the series) issued a statement to press who received the episode early, explaining:  ""In light of recent events, the producers have decided to remove the brief reference to Kevin Spacey.""  So once again, either This Is Us has some foresight they’re not sharing with us, or the NBC series is just really good at making references."	0

It's all simply speculation—no confirmation has come from Gomez, Theroux or either of their reps—though Life & Style's source adds fuel to the gossip by suggesting that Jennifer Aniston, ""is not happy"" about the rumored love connection between her Theroux and Gomez, her former husband of two years and friend, respectively.  There's certainly truth that Gomez and Theroux have been spending some time together. In early May, the two were spotted together in New York City, on a group outing with a whole crew of A-list pals, including Paul Rudd and his wife Julie Yaeger, Rooney Mara, and photographer friend to both Gomez and Theroux, Petra Collins.  BACKGRID  Like Gomez, Collins has also been linked to The Leftovers star, with romance rumors following shortly after Theroux and Aniston's public breakup back in February. But more recent reporting suggests that the pair are strictly platonic.  Due to the gaping 21-year age difference between Gomez and Theroux, it's likely that The Leftovers star and the ""Fetish"" singer are no more than friends—but in the small world of Hollywood, crazier things have happened."	1
Much like many of us, Meryl Streep is missing the Obama family. So much so, in fact, that she decided to carry a piece of them with her everywhere she goes.    While filming a movie in New York yesterday, the Oscar-winning actress was spotted by E! News leaving her trailer with a custom purse featuring a photo of Barack and Michelle Obama. Set against a White House backdrop, the former First couple is pictured smiling and dancing on the patent leather handbag.  Splash News  While it's unclear where the actress bought her personalized Obama bag, I'm hoping it was a DIY project she spent a long afternoon on. Someone call Miranda Priestly because Streep is about to single-handedly start her own Fall 2017 trend of Obama handbags and I am totally on-board.  Shutterstock  I mean, do you see this bag?  Have you seen a more legendary accessory?    That's all.	0
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Randee Dawn  Carrie Underwood has set her sights on some serious goals. Hockey goals, that is!  That's because the Nashville Predators, for which her husband Mike Fisher is both center and captain, are currently battling it out in the Stanley Cup Finals!  And they're doing quite well; as of Monday night, the team was tied 2-2 in the series against the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Perhaps that has something to do with Underwood, who's been the biggest cheerleader of them all, posting pictures and videos on Instagram where she's decked out in Predators buttons, jersey and a hat.  Let's not forget the special mani-pedi!  She's also been making friends with at least one hockey legend: Wayne Gretzky.  We already know the Underwood/Fisher household is full of Predators fans. These days, the toddler attends games to watch daddy play, was there for his dad's 1,000th game, and Underwood even sang the national anthem before a game in April.  But having a shot at winning the Cup is a whole other level of excitement, which might explain why there was no time to do anything about Fisher's 37th birthday on Monday night. As Underwood told NBC during a game intermission yesterday, ""I didn't get him anything! I'm terrible.""  Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher at the 2013 CMT Music Awards in Nashville.

Kathy Griffin is said to feel betrayed by friend and CNN host Anderson Cooper after she was axed from the network over the Trump severed head photo scandal.  The comedian had expected Cooper to stand by her as she was hit with a wave of criticism after posting an image earlier this week in which she appeared to be holding Donald Trump's severed head, sources told Page Six.  Instead, Griffin was fired from her post as Cooper's New Year's Eve co-host on CNN - which she has done for the last 10 years - about 24 hours after he publicly condemned her actions.  Cooper wrote on his personal account Tuesday: 'For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.'  A source told Page Six: 'Kathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.'  Scroll down for video  Kathy Griffin gave a tearful press conference on Friday after being hit with a wave of criticism for posting an image in which she appeared to be holding Donald Trump's severed head  Kathy Griffin is said to feel betrayed by friend and CNN host Anderson Cooper after she was axed from the network over the Trump severed head photo scandal  Griffin broke down in tears during a press conference with her lawyer Lisa Bloom on Friday when she was asked to comment on Cooper's criticism of her.  'That hurt, that's all,' she said tearfully.  The 56-year-old had already apologized for the photo on Tuesday before deciding to hold the press conference, during which she accused Trump and his family of launching a campaign to destroy her life.  A top Hollywood publicist told The Wrap that Griffin's news conference only made things worse.  'If she were my client, I'd tell her to shut the f*** up,' the unnamed publicist said.  'You're not talking to anyone and you're certainly not talking to Lisa Bloom anymore.'  On Friday, Griffin tearfully detailed the torrent of abuse she has been receiving online and the constant death threats.  She stated however that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully.'  Griffin said her career was likely over now as a result of the incident, and that President Trump had 'broke' her, moments after she declared: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!'  She said at one point that this would not be happening to her if she was a 'white man.'  Breaking it down: Griffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate'  Griffin's long-time co-host Anderson Cooper also criticized her on Twitter  Response: First lady Melania Trump (above on election night with Barron and Donald) rushed to protect her son, saying' 'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing.'  Her lawyer Lisa Bloom also suggested during the press conference that despite reports, Barron was likely not that upset after seeing the image of Griffin with the decapitated head by stating the child was 'allegedly' traumatized.  'We don't know that. You're assuming that everything that Trump says is true, and in fact, we know that everything Trump says is false,' said Bloom.  It was also confirmed at the press conference that the Secret Service is investigating Griffin over the image, with the comedian saying: 'Yeah I might get arrested today. I don't care.'  Griffin's criminal lawyer Dimitry Goran also joined her Friday.  'I am really nervous, I have never done a press conference,' said Griffin after she was introduced by her lawyer.  After making a few jokes and stating that she stands by the apology she released earlier this week, Griffin said: 'The president and his grown children and the first lady are personally trying to ruin my life forever.'  She then went back to that notion a few moments later, speaking in disbelief as she reiterated her claim that 'this president of all people is going to come after' an 'obnoxious comedian.'  Griffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate.'  Tough day: Kathy Griffin broke down in tears speaking about the constant attacks from the public and members of the Trump family over the past few days  She added that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully'  Aggressors: Griffin declared at one point: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!' (Griffin and Trump together in 2010 on the season finale of The Apprentice with Brandy Kuentzel and Stephanie Castagnier)  Back in the day: Griffin and President Trump first met in 1995 she revealed in a recent interview, and he guest starred on her sitcom 'Suddenly Susan' in 1997 (above)  'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin of President Trump  That became clear soon after when she announced that she would not stop attacking President Trump just because he had targeted her.  'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin.  She then made a point of adding: 'I am not going to threaten him, I have no desire to harm him.'  Griffin was also ready with some thoughts on why President Trump had elected to attack her while his son Don Jr. called for her to be fired from her jobs.  'They are using me as the shining object so no one talks about his FBI investigation,' said Griffin.  She then revealed that all she wanted to do was get back to work, something that is becoming difficult with five venues cancelling her show in the wake of the incident.  'I'm not for everybody,. I am barely an acquired taste frankly,' admitted Griffin.  'I've had everybody turn on me. And I just want to make people laugh.'  That being said, Griffin declared: 'I am not laying down for this guy.'  She later added towards the end of the press conference: 'It's a good time to be a comedian but a scary time to be a citizen.'  The comedian did not however say anything about her relationship with President Trump, who she has known for 20 years.  She also worked with him multiple times over the course of her career, most recently in the 2010 finale of 'The Apprentice,' where she also appeared alongside Ivanka and Don Jr.  Calm before the storm: Griffin was seen arriving to the press conference on Friday morning (above)  Team: Griffin arrived with a group of three men including boyfriend Randy Bick (left) and a man who appeared to be a bodyguard (right)  Griffin also said that it was Megyn Kelly who inspired her to take the image, saying: 'I started thinking of that Megyn Kelly thing. By the way, I'm sure Megyn Kelly can't stand me. I thought of that blood coming out of her eyes blood or coming out of her wherever.'  The comedian and Kelly previously had a run-in this past December at a Women In Hollywood breakfast.  Kelly was the emcee of the event, and when she began to speak about President Trump things took a turn.  'I have high hopes for him. Despite the tweets and all the rest of it, there is much to admire about Donald Trump,' said Kelly, which immediately elicited booing from a few people, the loudest being comedian Kathy Griffin.  'There is. Stop that, stop that. There's room for the loyal opposition in this country,' said Kelly at that point, a comment which resulted in Griffin screaming, 'F*** him.'  Kelly then responded: 'Guess who that is? Kathy Griffin.'  Griffin later explained how things went down the day of the shoot.  'Let's make this really obvious that I'm making an absurdist, artsy thing,' said Griffin.  'For a few photos, I was holding up this wig head and we kept making the hair crazier.'  She went on to explain: ' We just took these pictures, it was interesting. There were a few people in the house. I didn't do anything for money.'  Griffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'  It was an emotional appearance for Griffin, who most difficult moment came when she began to wail while saying of President Trump: 'He broke me. He broke me. He broke me.'  That was when Griffin said she realized that 'this isn't right.'  'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin.  'I had learned over the years that sometimes when you do standup, people want a joke that's out there and a little crazy.'  She went on to say: 'I feel horrible. I have performed in war zones. Trust me, if we could redo the whole thing I'd have a blowup doll and ketchup. If you don't stand up you get run over.'  Thus far, Griffin had had five tour dates cancelled, lost her endorsement deal with Squatty Potty and been fired by CNN.  Griffin also found some time for humor, joking about President Trump at one point by saying: 'If you meet him he wants to call you The Donald. I said I am The Kathy, and that went over his nest.'  She also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson.'  Her lawyer Lisa Bloom meanwhile seemed to dismiss the idea that Barron Trump, 11, was disturbed by the image, saying he was 'allegedly traumatized'  Photoshop protest: A man rushed the podium at one point holding an image of Griffin with Bloom's decapitated head (above)  A little mystery to figure out: Griffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'  Been around the block: 'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin.  Smile through the tears: She also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson'  Griffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December  Griffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December in an interview with Vulture.  'Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,' said Griffin.  'For me, that's Trump and all things Trump. It's not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It's his turn.'  She continued: 'So I'm happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump - and also to Barron. You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I'll go direct for Barron. I'm going to get in ahead of the game.'  That comment spurred Don Jr. to comment after Griffin's interview, writing on Twitter: 'To put everything into perspective this is a must read from Dec 16 even states it's ok to go after Barron an 11 y/o.'  Most would take issue with an adult targeting a child for ridicule, but Griffin's lawyer said on Friday that she should not have lost any jobs over this image.  The only reason she did lose those jobs however explained Bloom, was because of the Trump family.  'As a result of the first family bullying her, she has been vilified, getting death threats, fired from multiple jobs and had multiple events canceled,' said Bloom.  Those death threats are more serious than the loss of work for Griffin, who said: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed.'  Griffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you.'  Bloom also stressed her client's impeccable record and the fact that she has never committed an act of violence or assault before, stating: 'Kathy never imagined it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended.'  The victim's rights lawyer, who also represented a number of former employees who are suing Fox News, also noted of the photo shoot: 'This was clearly a parody of Trump's own sexist remarks, taken to an extreme, edgy visual.'  She used her introduction to explain why President Trump's actions against Griffin were such a problem.  'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom.  'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented.'  Griffin also pointed out what she claimed was another difference between herself and President Trump, saying: 'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what.'  Comparisons: 'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom  Truce: Bloom added: 'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented'  Inconsolable: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed,' said Griffin (above)  Warning shot: Griffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you'  'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what,' said Griffin  Griffin thinks that ultimately she was targeted because of her sex and her level of fame.  'It's quite clear they're trying to use me as a distraction and I'm not going to be collateral damage for this fool,' said Griffin.  'I'm the easiest target. I'm D-list comedian Kathy Griffin.'  And while she wanted to stay quiet, she was afraid about others suffering a fate similar to her own she explained on Friday.  'He broke me and then I was like 'No, this isn't right,'' said Griffin.  'I apologized because was the right thing to do. Then it became a mob mentality pile-on.'  Griffin, who said she is '110 pounds when wet,' went on to explain: 'He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, having a celebrity feud He's using the power of the government.'  Bloom made a similar comment, stating: 'The message was clear: Criticize the president, lose your job.'  She also noted: 'Ted Nugent threatened to kill President Obama. President Trump invited him to the White House.'  The lawyer's anger towards President Trump also turned a but personal at one point it seemed, when she shouted out at one reporter: 'There's a lot of disgusting stuff on the news every day, like the fact that [President Trump is] making us the laughing stock of the world.'  Getaway: Griffin was seen being driven home by her longtime boyfriend Bick after her press conference on Friday  Pricey ride: The couple were riding in a Maserati Quattroporte, which start at over $100,000  Eyes forward: Griffin did not look at the photographers as she made her exit out of her attorney's office  Safe and sound: The comedian's bodyguard could be seen sitting in the backseat of the car  Griffin spoke about President Trump at length in an interview this past March with CityBeat Cincinnati, revealing that the two had known one another for two decades.  'I've known him off and on since 1995,' said Griffin.  'I feel very privileged to be able to bring my own personal run-ins with 'The Cheeto' to audiences all over, but most importantly to Cincinnati. The Taft Theatre audience needs to hear from someone who has met him several times'  Griffin admitted in the interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of President Trump.  'I found him to always be a buffoon,' she explained.  'But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless.'  She then revealed that President Trump would often ask her to not go after him during her stand-up routines.  'Almost every time I've run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, 'Uh, oh, don't be too hard on me. I know you're going to be funny, but you can be tough,'' said Griffin.  'I find that fascinating.'  She also mentioned that one of her best friends, the late Joan Rivers, was also incredibly close to President Trump.  'I think she got a kick out of him, but I don't think she knew this side of him,' said Griffin.  'I don't know if anybody knew he was this racist and stupid, because I think you assume that people who have done well in one area or another have a certain acumen or certain talents.'  Rough week: She said that she has been receiving constant death threats, which she described as detailed and specific  Not a fan: Griffin admitted in a March interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of Trump  Explanation: 'I found him to always be a buffoon. But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless,' said Griffin  Plea: 'Almost every time I've run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, 'Uh, oh, don't be too hard on me. I know you're going to be funny, but you can be tough,'' said Griffin  Griffin was roundly criticized after posting the photo earlier this week, with everyone from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton to her good friend Anderson Cooper publicly stating that the photo and accompanying video was 'appalling' and 'disgusting.'  President Trump also spoke out after seeing the photo, as did his son Don Jr., daughter-in-law Lara and the First Lady.  Meanwhile, the harsh words keep coming for Griffin, with Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey the latest to take aim at the entertainer, saying at a news conference on Thursday: 'She's disgusting. And it's completely outrageous. I don't think anybody should hire her again for anything.'  Bloom has also been receiving her fair share of negative notes, with the lawyer Tweeting Friday morning: 'To all you sending me hate mail today for my representation of Kathy Griffin, I have this message for you. XO Lisa'  She then included an image of an affirmation that read: 'The Devil whispered in my ear, 'You're not strong enough to withstand the storm.'  'Today I whispered in the Devil's ear, 'I am the storm.''  The four Trumps who denounced Griffin all stressed the fact that there are young children in the family who were traumatized by the image.  Don Jr. was the first to speak out, with the oldest Trump child taking to Twitter soon after the image was posted on Tuesday.  He posted twelve tweets in the span of 24 hours, with many calling for CNN to fire Griffin.  'Dear @CNN, I must have missed your statement banning your commentator #KathyGriffin from future shows. Please resend. Thx,' wrote Don Jr. in one tweet.  He also responded to tweets from CNN anchors Jake Taper and Cooper after they reprimanded Griffin on the social media site, asking why she still had not been fired and if they would work with the comedian in the future.  The men did not engage Don Jr., and on Wednesday it was announced that CNN had terminated Griffin from their annual New Year's Eve show.  Don Jr. also brought up his two oldest children, daughter Kai and son Don III in one tweet, writing: 'And I'm counting down having to explain it to my 8 and 10 year olds who I'm sure will see/hear about it at school.'  Loud and proud: 'I got no comment. The thing is, when you make art you go to stand by it,' Shields said while out shopping, hours after Griffin lost her CNN job (pair above in early May)  Commander-in-chief: President Trump tweeted to say the comedian should 'be ashamed of herself'  Nonstop: Don Jr. repeatedly called for Griffin to be fired from her job at CNN< which she was on Wednesday  That was the line President Trump took that same day, writing on Twitter:'Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!'  The most damning statement however came from the First Lady, who has done her best to stay out of the many controversies that have mired her husband's presidency.  'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,' said Melania just hours after a report emerged claiming that her son Barron initially thought that his father had been decapitated when he saw the image on TV.  'When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.'  Lara was the last to speak out, and targeted the photographer Tyler Shields.  The daughter-in-law of President Trump expressed how appalled she was during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night, before going on to state that Griffin is not the only person who should be getting heat for the incident.  'She has many people around her. There was a photographer involved. I'm sure she has a publicist that works with her,' said Lara.  'There were a lot of people around that could have said, 'You know what, this crosses a line.''  The publicists who represent Griffin at PMK•BNC told DailyMail.com that they were not involved in the photo shoot.  Lara also said during her Fox News appearance that the family was doing their best to take this latest incident in stride, but struggling in the wake of reports which revealed that Barron was terrified after seeing the image of his father on television.  'I'd love to say that it gets easier. It doesn't get easier, but we can handle it' explained Lara.  'We've taken it for almost two years and we understand that this is the world we live in and we've accepted it, in a way.'  'It tells you the society that we live in today and what some people deem acceptable,' Lara, who is expecting her first child with husband Eric, later said in the interview.  'Had this happened to President Obama, I can only imagine what people would be saying right now.'  Shields meanwhile continues to stand by the image.  'I got no comment. The thing is, when you make art you go to stand by it,' Shields said during the exchange outside Gelson's supermarket, which was posted by TMZ.  When asked if he would do it again, maybe with another politician, Shield simply said: 'I cant censor myself'  Lashing out: Lara Trump (above) criticized Kathy Griffin during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night  Even former first daughter Chelsea Clinton was quick to express her outrage at Griffin tweeting: 'This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president  As for Griffin, Sheilds said he had spoken to his friend and subject and that the two were good in the wake of the photo shoot.  He then wrapped things up by stating: 'I'm just going to go home and eat my ice cream.'  In footage of the shoot, Griffin is seen joking that she and Shields will have to flee the country once it gets out.  'We have to move to Mexico today,' she said, 'because we're gonna go to prison. Federal prison.  'Call your dad, apologize, then let's you [and me] go to Mexico because we're not surviving this.'  She's seen in the footage lifting the grisly 'head' out of a metal bowl, then rotating it towards the camera until it hits a spot that Shields likes.  Finally, at Shields' demand, she drops it to the ground.  In the video, Griffin also joked: 'Tyler and I are not afraid to do images that make noise. And also he often lights me to the point where I look about 15.  'But first I'm an artist. But really it's good lighting.'  Griffin apologized on Tuesday for posting the video following a furious backlash and a hint at an investigation by Secret Service, which has now been confirmed.  The controversial entertainer tweeted: 'I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.'	1
The birth of baby True Thompson will unfold on this week’s Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  In a sneak peek at Sunday’s episode, Kris Jenner springs into action after she finds out that her daughter Khloé Kardashian is going into labor in Cleveland while the rest of the family is still in Los Angeles.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I gotta go. I just moved the plane up and I think she’s in labor,” says Jenner, 62. “I knew we should have gone last night. I knew it.”  “Do you want me to go with you?” asks Kim Kardashian West, 38, who had originally wanted to stay in L.A. for a few days so she could attend her 20-year high school reunion.  “No, you come in a couple of days,” Jenner says. “I’m going, I’m bringing the doctor. The only thing that frightens me is that she’s going to have this baby before I get there. And then she’s giving birth alone.”  Jenner rushes out of the room and Kim calls Khloé, 34, who asks whether her contractions should “feel like period cramps.”  “They keep going from different times so I don’t understand if I’m feeling them,” she says. “One was at 9:43, one was at 8:21, one was at 10-something.”  “Okay, I’m going to run and get my bag and I’m going to come with Mom,” Kim insists.  “You know, when there’s something crazy that goes on in our family, we just always drop everything that we’re doing and go be supportive to them,” she explains. “I obviously wanted to go to my reunion and I wanted to make both work, but since my reunion is in two days, it’s like, game over — it doesn’t matter. I’m going to go to Cleveland and be there for her.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khloé Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal  Khloé welcomed her first child, daughter True, with boyfriend Tristan Thompson on April 12, just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.  While calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest this summer, Kim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.  “Sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren’t,” she said. “It was more maybe when Khloé wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do. It was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world. I think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there’s a baby, you know?  “Her motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,” she added of Khloé standing by Thompson, 27, throughout the cheating scandal. “So we’ll support that.”  Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!	0

Sharon Stone is the blonde bombshell who just gets better with age.  The 60-year-old beauty is still in top shape and has been landing role after role - she is currently on HBO's series Mosaic.

Jimmy Fallon has broken his silence about his interview with Donald Trump last September, saying he was “devastated” with all the backlash he faced.  “I’m a people pleaser,” he said in a New York Times interview that was published Wednesday. “If there’s one bad thing on Twitter about me, it will make me upset. So, after this happened, I was devastated. I didn’t mean anything by it. I was just trying to have fun.”  In September, Fallon had Trump as a guest on “The Tonight Show.” In the now infamous interview, the host asked Trump if he could ruffle his hair.  See Video: Donald Trump Lets Jimmy Fallon Mess Up His Famous Hairdon't  Fallon faced a lot of backlash for playing with Trump’s hair, with many commenting on how Fallon shouldn’t have let Trump off the hook for his racist and sexist comments while on the campaign trail. He was also widely criticized for being too soft on the divisive then-presidential candidate, with many accusing Fallon of “normalizing” Trump. Comedian Billy Eichner, for example, slammed Fallon, saying it wasn’t “a good moment.”  Fallon defended the interview, saying “Have you seen my show? I’m never too hard on anyone. We’ll have Hillary [Clinton] on tomorrow, and we’ll do something fun with her too.”  Now, Fallon said he didn’t play with Trump’s hair to “humanize him” — in fact, he “he did it to minimize him.”  “I didn’t think that would be a compliment: ‘He did the thing that we all wanted to do,'” Fallon explained.

I can’t read the internet.”  Fallon said he understands now that he should’ve talked about it on air when the backlash didn’t subside, even after a couple of days: “I didn’t talk about it, and I should have talked about it. I regret that.”  And although he was upset that people didn’t like his Trump interview, that event wasn’t going to force him to make changes at “The Tonight Show.” Because in the end, Fallon explained, he wants his show to be where people get their entertainment and their laughs.  “I don’t want to be bullied into not being me, and not doing what I think is funny,” he said more defiantly. “Just because some people bash me on Twitter, it’s not going to change my humor or my show.”  He added: “It’s not ‘The Jimmy Fallon Show.’ It’s ‘The Tonight Show.'”  Read the full New York Times interview here.	0

John Mayer recently got super candid and revealed that his new song, ‘Still Feel Like Your Man,’ is all about his ex, Katy Perry. The emotional track makes it very clear that he’s missing his ex big time. So, is he going hard to get her back? Here’s what we know!  Katy Perry, 32, and John Mayer, 39, had a very intense — and tumultuous — relationship. They dated on and off from August 2012 until they finally split for good in 2015. Katy moved on to Orlando Bloom, 40, and it seemed like John was history. But a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that John has never given up on winning her back.  “John was practically jumping for joy when he found out about her breakup with Orlando,” says our source. “Since then he’s been bombarding her with calls and flowers. He’s written her poetry and songs, getting her back is all her cares about these days.” So sweet!  John has a history of going hot and cold on Katy so we’re not surprised that she hasn’t gone running straight back to him. But his new song ‘Still Feel Like Your Man’ has got to be pulling at her heart strings a little. With lyrics like “I still keep your shampoo in my shower, in case you want to wash your hair” and “Still think I’m never going to find another you,” the song is a serious tear jerker.  But John isn’t stopping with love songs and flowers, he’s also started talking babies! The sexy singer just opened up to The New York Times and revealed that he’s ready to settle down and have a family. “That’s the final frontier, man,” he admitted. We love that John is finally growing up — but only time will tell if Katy’s willing to give him another chance.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Katy should take John back? Or will he break her heart all over again? Let us know in the comments!	1
