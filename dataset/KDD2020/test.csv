Eminem’s moderately anticipated ninth album now has a confirmed title and release date. As suggested in an advance press campaign intended to resemble pharmaceutical marketing, the album is titled Revival. It’s out December 15, a little over four years since the release of The Marshall Mathers LP 2 in 2013. Revise your year-end lists accordingly.  In recent weeks, Eminem released a new collaboration with Beyoncé, “Walk on Water,” pondered why Donald Trump did not respond to his anti-Trump freestyle during the BET Hip-Hop Awards, and performed on Saturday Night Live.  Dr. Dre first shared Revival’s release information in the form of another faux drug commercial, which mercifully promises to be the last. “Use as prescribed by your doctor,” he captioned it.

"Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season. The Colts defeated the Bears by the score of 29–17. The game was played on February 4, 2007 at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.  This game featured two teams ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who finished with a 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team's tenure in Baltimore; they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. In addition, the Bears' Lovie Smith and the Colts' Tony Dungy both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win.  In the first Super Bowl played in rainy conditions, the Colts overcame a 14–6 first-quarter deficit to outscore the Bears 23–3 in the last three quarters. Chicago posted the then-earliest lead in Super Bowl history when returner Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown after 14 seconds had elapsed (a record later broken in Super Bowl XLVIII when the Seattle Seahawks scored a safety 12 seconds into the game). The Colts forced five turnovers, including cornerback Kelvin Hayden's 56-yard interception return for a touchdown. Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri also scored three field goals. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8.  CBS' broadcast of the game was watched by an estimated average of 93.2 million viewers, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history.[10] The halftime show, headlined by the musician Prince, peaked at 140 million television viewers, and was widely acclaimed by music critics.[11]  Background [ edit ]  Host selection process [ edit ]  Dolphin Stadium won the bid to host Super Bowl XLI on September 17, 2003 after a campaign against Phoenix, Tampa, New York City, and Washington, D.C.. With this game, the Miami Metropolitan Area tied New Orleans, Louisiana as the city to host the most Super Bowls (9).[12]  This was the fourth Super Bowl at Dolphin Stadium, which has also been known as ""Joe Robbie Stadium"" and ""Pro Player Stadium"". The venue previously hosted Super Bowls XXIII (broadcast on NBC), XXIX (on ABC), and XXXIII (on FOX). Super Bowls II, III, V, X, and XIII were also in Miami, but held at the Miami Orange Bowl. This was the first Super Bowl played at the stadium since the city of Miami Gardens where the stadium is located was incorporated on May 13, 2003.  In February 2006, the NFL and the South Florida Super Bowl XLI Host Committee unveiled the slogan ""one game, one dream"" for the game, referring to the entire South Florida region working together to present the event.[13] The Super Bowl XLI logo was also unveiled, featuring the colors orange (to represent the sun) and blue (for the ocean).[13] The ""I"" in the Roman numeral ""XLI"" was drawn to resemble a pylon placed at each corner of an end zone because ""the goal is to get to the game.""[13] The logo had the same shade of orange as the logo of the host city's home team, the Miami Dolphins. The ""XL"" part was similar to that of Super Bowl XL's logo.  Teams [ edit ]  Indianapolis Colts [ edit ]  The Colts' first trip to the Super Bowl in 36 years set a record for longest time between appearances by a team. Their return was the culmination of a nine-year-long building process. In 1998, they drafted quarterback Peyton Manning to lead the team. Over the next four seasons, Manning, along with other stars such as receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James, turned the Colts into one of the best offensive teams in the NFL, but the team struggled to find consistency on defense and always ended up with either a losing season or elimination from the playoffs in the first round. In 2002, Indianapolis fired head coach Jim Mora and replaced him with Tony Dungy. Dungy had developed one of the best defenses in the NFL while coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it was hoped he could solve the Colts' defensive problems as well.  Over the next four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind impressive offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts had one of the most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.  In 2005, the Colts' defense improved, making the team the clear favorites in the NFL. They won the first 13 games of the season and finished with a 14–2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in the divisional round of the playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–18. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys.  Still, the Colts remained one of the AFC's top teams in the 2006 season. Manning made the Pro Bowl for the 7th time in his career, completing 362 of 555 passes for 4,397 yards and an NFL-best 31 touchdowns, with an additional 4 rushing touchdowns and with only 9 interceptions and 15 sacks. His favorite target was Harrison, who caught 95 passes for 1,366 yards and 12 touchdowns. Receiver Reggie Wayne was also a major deep threat with 86 receptions for 1,310 yards and 9 touchdowns. Tight ends Ben Utecht and Dallas Clark were also reliable targets, each recording over 30 receptions for over 300 yards. On the ground, rookie running back Joseph Addai led the team with 1,081 yards and a 4.8 yards-per-carry average despite not starting any games in the regular season. He also caught 40 receptions for 325 yards and scored 8 touchdowns. Running back Dominic Rhodes was also a major contributor, rushing for 641 yards and catching 36 passes for 251 yards. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Jeff Saturday and Tarik Glenn. On special teams, the Colts signed kicker Adam Vinatieri to replace Vanderjagt. While Vinatieri's career field goal percentage was lower, the Colts considered him to be an improvement because of his reputation for making ""clutch"" kicks, a reputation aided by his game winning field goals in Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII.  Indianapolis' defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis (who recorded 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely considered to be among the best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed.  Indianapolis started out the season winning their first nine games, but ended up losing four of their next seven and finished with a 12–4 record, giving them the #3 playoff seed. Thus, having to play in a wild card playoff game. In the playoffs, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23-8, defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15-6 in the divisional round, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI with a 38-34 win over the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.  Chicago Bears [ edit ]  Chicago finished the season with an NFC best 13–3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in the divisional round of the playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC Championship game to advance to Super Bowl XLI. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive.[14] They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive[14] thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.  The Bears offense was led by quarterback Rex Grossman, the team's first round draft pick in 2003. Over the previous three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By the end of the season, he finished with 3,193 yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding turnovers, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach Lovie Smith to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.  Receivers Muhsin Muhammad (60 receptions, 863 yards, 5 touchdowns) and Bernard Berrian (51 receptions, 775 yards, 7 touchdowns) provided the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end Desmond Clark, who caught 45 passes for 626 yards and 6 touchdowns. Chicago's running game was led by running backs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson. Jones rushed for 1,210 yards and caught 36 passes, while Benson rushed for 647 yards and scored 6 touchdowns.  Chicago's defense allowed the 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100 yards per game on the ground,[15] and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team.[14] The line was anchored by Adewale Ogunleye, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler Tommie Harris, who recorded 5, along with rookie Mark Anderson, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, two of the three Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. The defense was also able to make up for the offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.  The loss of Harris to injury after the twelfth game of the season coincided with a decline in defensive performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9).[16] After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship game were held below 21 points.[17]  The Bears' special teams sent three players to the Pro Bowl, including special teams ace Brendon Ayanbadejo, kicker Robbie Gould (who led all NFL kickers with 143 points), and rookie return man Devin Hester, who gained 600 punt return yards with a 12.8 yards per return average, the second highest in the NFL. He also set a league record with 6 touchdowns on special teams.  Regular season statistical comparison [ edit ]  The chart below provides a comparison of regular season statistics in key categories (overall rank amongst 32 teams in parentheses).[18]  Statistic Indianapolis Colts Chicago Bears Points scored per game 26.7 (2nd, tied) 26.7 (2nd, tied) Points allowed per game 22.5 (23rd) 15.9 (3rd) Rushing yards gained per game 110.1 (18th) 119.9 (15th) Rushing yards allowed per game 173.0 (32nd) 99.4 (6th) Passing yards gained per game 269.2 (2nd) 205.1 (14th) Passing yards allowed per game 159.2 (2nd) 194.8 (11th) Yards gained per play 6.0 (2nd) 5.0 (21st) Yards allowed per play 5.5 (29th) 4.6 (2nd) Time of possession per game 29:32 (23rd) 30:56 (11th) Third-down conversion percentage 56 (1st) 37 (22nd) Third-down conversion percentage allowed 47 (32nd) 31 (2nd) Fourth-down conversion percentage 0 (32nd) 69 (4th, tied) Fourth-down conversion percentage allowed 79 (30th, tied) 62 (27th) Total turnover differential +7 (7th) +8 (4th)  Playoffs [ edit ]  Although the Colts' rushing defense looked extremely weak during the season, it ended up being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, holding Chiefs running back Larry Johnson (who rushed for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6, winning on a playoff record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back Jamal Lewis (who rushed for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.  Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England jumped to an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed back in the second half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an additional field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69 yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.  Meanwhile, the Bears started out their post-season with a 27–24 win over the Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they defeated the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship Game. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. Thomas Jones finished the game with a franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.  It was the first time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference championship games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game (the St. Louis Rams were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl, XXXIV inside the Georgia Dome in Atlanta). The 2006 Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (2003 Carolina Panthers) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.  For the Bears, this marked the first time that a Chicago sports team not owned by Jerry Reinsdorf had reached the champion game/series in their league since the Blackhawks lost in the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.  Super Bowl pre-game practices and notes [ edit ]  Dolphin Stadium prepares for Super Bowl XLI  The Indianapolis Colts held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Dolphins Training Facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. The Colts' ""Team and Family"" hotel was the Marriott Harbor Beach.[19] At the 2007 Indianapolis 500 pre-race ceremonies on May 27, 2007, eventual Super Bowl XLI MVP Peyton Manning stated to ABC Sports commentator Brent Musburger the day before the game that two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Hélio Castroneves gave a pep talk to the Colts team.  The Chicago Bears held pre-game practices for Super Bowl XLI at the Miami Hurricanes Football Facility, on the campus of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.  Chicago defensive tackle Tank Johnson was required to request a judge's order to leave the state of Illinois due to an arrest for unlicensed ownership of six firearms and two assault rifles. On January 23, 2007, the judge granted him permission to travel out of state to play in the Super Bowl.[20]  Chicago and Indianapolis are the two closest cities, geographically, to ever play in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293 km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are slightly closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, at the end of the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.[21]  This was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl VI that all players on both teams wore black shoes.  Broadcasting [ edit ]  United States [ edit ]  The game was televised in the United States by CBS in high-definition with play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz and color commentator Phil Simms. This was the first Super Bowl announced by Nantz.[22] Additionally, the game had Steve Tasker (Bears sideline) and Solomon Wilcots (Colts sideline) reporting on the sidelines and Lesley Visser (Bears sideline) and Sam Ryan (Colts sideline) in the stands.  This was the first Super Bowl aired on CBS since the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake incident three years earlier, in Super Bowl XXXVIII; and the first since the Viacom/CBS split at the end of 2005. Extensive pre-game coverage, hosted by The NFL Today team of James Brown, Shannon Sharpe, Boomer Esiason and Dan Marino, whose name graces the address of the game site (2269 Dan Marino Boulevard), began at noon (US EST) with NFL Films' ""Road to the Super Bowl"" year in review (narrated by Tom Selleck). This was followed by ""The Phil Simms All-Iron Team"", and a four-and-a-half-hour Super Bowl Today pre-game show followed by game coverage at 6:25 PM.[23] Other contributors to the pre-game show included Katie Couric, anchor of the CBS Evening News, Armen Keteyian, CBS News Chief Investigative Corrrespondent, Randy Cross, who reported from Iraq where U.S. military forces played a touch football game known as ""The Baghdad Bowl"" and Dick Enberg, who participated in his 12th Super Bowl telecast as a host, play-by-play announcer, or contributor. Westwood One provided radio coverage of the event, with Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason as announcers.[24]  ""The Baghdad Bowl"" flag football game played in Iraq.  The American Forces Network (AFN) provided coverage of the Super Bowl for U.S. forces stationed overseas and to all U.S. Navy ships at sea.[25]  The opening title sequence of CBS television coverage featured the composition Lux Aeterna, by artist Clint Mansell, in the background.  Nielsen Media Research reported 93 million viewers for Super Bowl XLI, making it at the time the fifth most watched program in U.S. television history (trailing only the M*A*S*H finale and Super Bowls XLIII, XXX, and XLII).[10]  Commercials [ edit ]  Advertising rates were reported as being slightly higher than in the year before, with CBS confirming a price of $2.6 million for some 30-second spots, compared with $2.5 million during Super Bowl XL. However, CNN reported that after discounts, the average price is likely closer to $1.8 to $2 million. Familiar advertisers in recent years such as Anheuser-Busch, CareerBuilder, General Motors and Coca-Cola bought multiple advertising spots, and other popular advertisers like Go Daddy and Emerald Nuts had commercials this year.[9]  The only major hype related to commercials in the months leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.[26]  The annual USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter survey chose a Budweiser ad featuring crabs worshiping an ice chest with that particular beer inside as the top ad of Super Bowl XLI, followed by another Bud commercial featuring a stray dog with mud spots climbing onto the brewery's trademark Clydsedale-drawn wagon in a parade. In all, Anheuser-Busch took seven of the top ten spots in the annual survey, sweeping the top three spots. A YouTube user survey chose the Doritos ""Snack Hard"" ad (produced for the incredible price of $12, the cost of three bags of the snack product)[27] as their top ad, that ad finished fourth in the USA Today survey. ADBOWL results were slightly different with only 6 of Anheuser-Busch's ads finishing in the top ten. The highest ranked being the Bud Light ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" spot. Also in the top ten were Blockbuster Video's ""Mouse"", Doritos' ""Car Wreck"", GM's ""Robot"" and Taco Bell's ""Lion's Talk 'Carne'.""  One ad that drew criticism from the gay community was for the Snickers candy bar featuring two men accidentally ""kissing"" each other after sharing the product in question, then proceeded to rip chest hairs as a manly act as homophobic.[28] The ad proved to be controversial, and the ad was cancelled the next day by Masterfoods USA (Mars, Incorporated's snack food division), and three other versions were deleted from the snickers.com web site. The ad was ninth in the USA Today ad survey, and according to a Masterfoods publicist, not intended to harm anyone.  A different ad for General Motors featured a laid off assembly line robot contemplating suicide, which drew criticism from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad be taken off the air and the company's website.[29] The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.  International [ edit ]  The Super Bowl was broadcast live in Canada on CBS (which is available in Canada) as well as Global TV and NTV which both took the main CBS commentary, and on the French cable channel RDS. In the United Kingdom the Super Bowl was broadcast on ITV1, Sky Sports 1 & Sky Sports HD1 with Sky Sports taking the main CBS commentary and ITV taking the NFL supplied international commentary feed of Spero Dedes and Sterling Sharpe.  Super Bowl XLI was broadcast in over 200 countries. Amongst the television networks who broadcast Super Bowl XLI were:  Entertainment [ edit ]  Pre-game ceremonies [ edit ]  Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega performed as the pre-game act,[32] and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was played at the same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.[33]  Marlee Matlin and Jason Hay-Southwell performed the National Anthem in American Sign Language.[34]  Besides participating in the CBS telecast of the pre-game show, Dan Marino also participated in the coin toss along with Norma Hunt, the widow of Lamar Hunt, the former owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and the man who gave the Super Bowl its name.  Halftime show [ edit ]  American singer and musician Prince headlined the halftime show  American singer and musician Prince performed in the halftime show.[35] The setlist for Prince's performance was a short rendition of ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen; Prince's hit songs ""Let's Go Crazy"" and ""Baby I'm a Star""; covers of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Proud Mary"", Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"", and Foo Fighters' ""Best of You""; and finally his signature song ""Purple Rain"" in the downpour. The 12-minute performance featured Prince accompanied by two dancers he called ""The Twinz"" (Maya and Nandy McClean)[36] and the Florida A&M University marching band, the Marching 100.[37] Prince had rehearsed with the drum line for a week before the performance. The performance was on a large, central stage which was shaped like Prince's logo, and was outlined with lights. He played before 74,512 fans at Dolphin Stadium, who had been given flashlights to point at the stage during the performance of ""Purple Rain"". The event was carried ""to the biggest audience of his life"" with 140 million television viewers.[11] Overall, the show was energetic and well received by the rain-soaked audience surrounding the stage.[38] Music critics were extremely enthusiastic about his performance, one calling it ""arguably the best halftime show in Super Bowl history"",[11] and others saying it was one of the best ever.[39][40]  Following the game, controversy emerged about a silhouetted camera shot of Prince, projected against a large sheet by a bright light on the other side of him. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it ""looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed"". Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that ""a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus"".[41] In 2015, Entertainment Tonight listed the silhouetted camera shot, naming it ""Prince's Demon Phallus"", as one of the top seven Super Bowl halftime moments.[42] In 2016, shortly after Prince's death, the halftime show's producer Don Mischer said that having a silhouetted camera shot of Prince was his idea, but denied it was meant to be a phallic statement.[43]  Post-game ceremonies [ edit ]  Former Colts and Dolphins head coach Don Shula presented the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Colts after the game, and Peyton Manning was named MVP.[44]  Game summary [ edit ]  First Quarter [ edit ]  The Bears won the coin toss and elected to receive. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game was played in the rain, which was continuous throughout the game.  The rain did not hinder Bears' return man Devin Hester, who ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown to give Chicago the then earliest lead in Super Bowl history, after only 14 seconds.[45] The Colts avoided kicking to Hester for the rest of the game, allowing him only one punt return, and choosing to squib kick whenever Hester was in the deep kickoff return position.[citation needed]  On Indianapolis' first drive of the game, defensive back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning and returned it 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and they were forced to punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.  On the first play after the turnover, Thomas Jones's 52-yard run moved the ball to the Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving the Bears a 14–6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.  Second Quarter [ edit ]  Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinatieri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14–9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive, and return man Terrence Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to his own 42-yard line. Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to Marvin Harrison. His next pass went to tight end Dallas Clark for 17 yards. Two more completions moved the ball to the Bears' 11-yard line, and then Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16–14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.  After another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.  Third Quarter [ edit ]  Wilkins returned the second half kickoff 26 yards to the Colts's 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25 yards and caught four passes for 19 yards as the Colts drove 56 yards in 13 plays and scored with a 29-yard field goal from Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19–14. On the Bears' next drive, Jones started out with a 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down and one on the Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Anthony McFarland. Then, on third down, he fumbled the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52 yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked his third field goal to make the score 22–14.  Chicago tight end John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff and returned it 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15 yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was enough for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.  Fourth Quarter [ edit ]  After an Indianapolis 7-play drive ended in a punt, Chicago started on their own 20-yard line with 13:38 left in the game. But four plays later, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown.  From that point on, the Colts took over the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.  Box score [ edit ]  Statistical overview [ edit ]  This was the third Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and Thomas Jones had 112 for the Bears. Tony Dungy is the third man to win the Super Bowl as a head coach as well as a player, following Tom Flores and Mike Ditka.  For the Colts, Rhodes rushed for 113 yards and a touchdown, while also catching an 8-yard reception. Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned four kickoffs for 89 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Adam Vinatieri became the first kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls and the first to win four Super Bowl rings. Vinatieri's three field goals and two extra points gave him 49 points for the entire 2006 post-season, an NFL record. The Colts' win was the first major professional championship for Indiana since the Indiana Pacers' ABA title in the 1972–73 season.  Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII). Hester's return also kept a streak alive for there being a kickoff return for a touchdown in each Super Bowl played at Dolphin Stadium. Hester's and Wayne's touchdowns in the first quarter marked the first time in Super Bowl history the first two touchdowns were scored by players from the same college (University of Miami). Jones was the Bears' top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching four passes for 18 yards. Desmond Clark was the Bears' top receiver with six receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, leaving him with a QB rating of 68.3 for the game.[48] Muhsin Muhammad became the third player ever to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl for two teams, joining Ricky Proehl and Jerry Rice.

Originally, spokesmen for Dolphin Stadium announced that tailgating would be permitted as usual. However, the NFL quickly contradicted this statement, announcing an NFL owner-imposed ban on all tailgating and prohibiting non-ticketed fans within a two-block-radius of the stadium.[50]  Prohibiting church display [ edit ]  The NFL upset a large number of fans by threatening churches with lawsuits if they had Super Bowl parties. National Football League assistant counsel Rachel L. Margolies sent a letter to the Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website.[51] She said that the church could not use the words ""Super Bowl"" as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates copyright law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55 inches), and could not ""promote a message"" in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. ""While this may be a noble message"", Rachel L. Margolies wrote, ""we are consistent in refusing the use of our game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content.""[52] Sports bars nationwide were allowed to show the game, as were businesses that televised sports as part of their everyday operations because they didn't charge admission and they left the message the NFL intended intact.  The Indianapolis Star picked up the story, and soon pastors across the U.S. were working to cancel their parties. Immediately the NFL received a backlash of bad publicity, with indignant football fans in constant sarcasm (akin to rules imposed about on-field behavior i.e. taunting opposition teams) referring to the NFL as the ""No Fun League.""[53] For example, the enforcement of this policy earned the NFL a ""Worst Person in the World"" silver on the edition of February 2, 2007 of Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[54]  After a long series of bad press, the NFL issued a written statement clarifying their policy, saying that they did not object to churches hosting Super Bowl parties so long as they did not charge admission and showed the game on ""a television of the type commonly used at home"". This statement did not attempt to forbid coordination of any other message with the game, something typically done by churches, nor did it attempt to forbid the use of the term ""Super Bowl.""[55][56]"	0

Rob Kardashian took to Instagram last week to share his story of the messy split between himself and popular model/reality tv star Blac Chyna. He also revealed some secrets and explicit photos of the model online.  ABC’s Nightline aired an interview with the model and she explained how she felt when her estranged partner shared her nude pictures on Instagram.  “I was devastated. I’m looking at this and I’m like, ‘How could someone do this to me?'” she confessed. “I was very fearful because I was like, ‘If you could do this, what else could you do?'”  Chyna stood up for herself saying that her past as a stripper is irrelevant. “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,”.  “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,” She told Good Morning America.  When she sent the photos to Rob, she did not consent to him posting or sharing for others to see. “The moral of the story is, like, he doesn’t respect me,” she said. “So if you can’t respect me, you have to respect the law.” In the interview, Chyna also repeated new claims of Rob being physically violent with her and making multiple suicide threats over the past few months. “Rob has hit me before. Yes, this was in April.”He threatened to kill himself multiple times in text messages since we broke up in December 2016, trying to manipulate me to respond to his outbursts. I have been telling Rob to get help and go to therapy since June 2016. To my knowledge, Rob has not seen a licensed therapist.”I am in fear of this angry, volatile, vindictive man, who has physically attacked me and tried to humiliate me so publicly. I am embarrassed by his posts. I ask for orders of protection so that I can live my life in peace and free of fear of him.” After the interview was recorded, Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob. Another court date has been scheduled for August.In spite of the troubles, Chyna hoped to work things out with Rob for the sake of their 8-month old daughter Dream Kardashian.	0

Tom Cruise truly is as great as he seems. The cast of Mission: Impossible-Fallout learned firsthand just how impressive the star was throughout the course of their filming. From stopping mid-take to ask extras if they were okay, to expertly maneuvering a helicopter in the mountains, Cruise won over the hearts of the star studded group, including Henry Cavill. “I am not easily impressed, and I know some people who have done genuinely seriously impressive stuff, and watching Tom do these stunts, especially in the mountains in that helicopter. I just thought, ‘Okay I am officially impressed,'” the Superman actor shared.  He added, “This is ridiculous what he is doing. And he learns all these skills for these movies and does them to an elite level. It is remarkable, truly remarkable.” Aside from being an amazing stuntman, the actors added that he is genuinely a good person, with Angela Bassett saying, “He truly is just incredibly warm, generous, embracing. As soon as he turns to see you he breaks out into this great smile and just welcomes you with a warm smile.”  For Rebecca Ferguson, she said the actor has the ability to make you feel like “you are the center of the room.”Simon Pegg on the other hand, just feels uncomfortable. “He compliments you a lot and he looks at you and it gets uncomfortable because you get so much Cruise love on you. People are always so all over on him, so I think he likes to redistribute it,” the Brit joked.  The general consensus though is that the Top Gun star is a just a normal guy, despite all the mystery that surrounds him. “He allows himself to be surrounded by a lot of mystique and conjecture and gossip and he just sort of lets it fester and I think that makes people think he is some sort of inhuman kind of thing, but he is just a bloke,” Pegg explained. Fans of the 56-year-old are delighted https://www.instagram.com/p/BiC6IVODUeD/?taken-by=tomcruiseby his return to the public eye as he travels the world to promote the most recent installment of the franchise. More recently, he has joined Jimmy Fallon for a hilarious round of Mad Lib Theatre, before crossing the country to join James Corden as he skydived for the first time.  Even as he excels as Ethan Hunt, it’s been hard for the actor to duplicate that magic in other would-be franchises.The last couple of years have not been kind to Tom Cruise’s status as an action hero. In 2016, he played the taciturn Jack Reacher again in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, following that in 2017 as the lead of The Mummy and American Made. All three of those movies stumbled in one way or another — American Made acquitted itself best of all and received strong reviews, but it was not exactly a runaway hit. Meanwhile, The Mummy doomed a shared universe before it began and Jack Reacher earned $56 million less globally than its predecessor.  That impact? No joke. #MissionImpossible A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Jun 18, 2018 at 12:09pm PDT  As Cruise is only four years away from 60 — yes, really — it’s not wrong to wonder if his action-star days are far behind him. But Mission: Impossible – Fallout suggests he’s got some life in him yet.Throughout the last two decades, Cruise has excelled when he plays IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt was first introduced in the 1996 movie adaptation of the 1960s TV show, Mission: Impossible, pulling off a daring and breathtaking break-in of CIA headquarters, fending off an attack by a man in a helicopter while hanging for his life on the top of a fast-moving train and more. As Cruise has grown older, he’s worked more often in action films than dramas — in between the first and second M:I films, Cruise co-starred in Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, a one-two punch he’s not replicated since — but he’s never better than when playing the beleaguered IMF agent.  Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.)  It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling.  The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises. (Hard to believe that we’re only a year removed from Universal announcing that so-called Dark Universe with The Mummy, which was a real don’t-count-your-chickens-until-they’ve-hatched situation.) Part of it falls to something Cruise can’t control: his age. In Fallout, both Michelle Monaghan and Rebecca Ferguson return to play important women in Ethan’s life, even though both actresses are a great deal younger than him. It was laughable in last year’s The Mummy when Cruise’s hero had a love interest who was young enough to be his daughter, just as it was laughable when the main character was referred to as younger than Dr. Jekyll, played by Russell Crowe (who is younger than Cruise). In Fallout, at least, there is an unavoidable sense that Ethan is getting wearier, physically and mentally. He’s still able to save the world, but he’s not always as spry on his feet.  A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Mar 15, 2018 at 8:05am PDT  Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a high point in Tom Cruise’s career. Frankly, in the last decade-plus, he’s only had a handful of standout films; four of them have been entries in this franchise. (Edge of Tomorrow was also a lot of fun, an exception in his recent filmography.) Though Tom Cruise may not be ageless, his intensity works in his favor when playing Ethan Hunt. A seventh Mission: Impossible has not yet officially been greenlit, but one is expected to be in the works. If Cruise can keep figuring out how to make Ethan’s exploits as brilliantly entertaining as they are in this new entry, then it’s almost worth the stumbles in between.	0
Of all the couples that walked the Oscars red carpet together on Sunday night, it’s likely none had the same symbolic significance as Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino. The actresses were among the earliest to come forward with their stories of being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein, bringing into stark relief the impact Weinstein had on their careers and on Hollywood at large. Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for the Weinstein-released Mighty Aphrodite, told The New Yorker she believed that, by turning down Weinstein’s advances, he had actively discouraged other filmmakers from working with her. Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.” (Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.)  In December, Peter Jackson told New Zealand’s Stuff that executives at Miramax told him about both Judd and Sorvino, “they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998. At the time, we had no reason to question what these guys were telling us—but in hindsight, I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing. I now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women—and as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list.”  Sorvino tweeted an emotional response to Jackson’s revelation:  Speaking to Vanity Fair’s Krista Smith on the red carpet, Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time‘s Up movement: “I want people to know that this movement isn’t stopping, we’re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,“ Sorvino said:  During the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. As Rebecca Keegan reported from the Oscars rehearsals, Sciorra—who claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her, and that her career suffered as a result—seemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.  Though the Time’s Up movement, which announced its presence forcefully with pins and an all-black dress code at the Golden Globes, announced it planned to look beyond the red carpet in its activism, Judd and Sorvino’s united presence was a reminder of how striking, and symbolic, a red carpet appearance can be.

"Kevin Spacey will no longer be honored by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences at its upcoming awards gala following actor Anthony Rapp's allegation that, when he was just 14, the ""House of Cards"" star made a sexual advance on him.  The International Academy made the announcement Monday night on its website.  ""The International Academy has announced today that in light of recent events it will not honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award,"" a statement read.  The International Academy has announced that in light of recent events it will not honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 Intl Emmy Founders Award — Intl Emmy Awards (@iemmys) October 30, 2017  Calling the two-time Oscar winner ""one of the great multi-dimensional talents in our industry,"" the International Academy first announced in June that Spacey was set to accept its Founders Award, which recognizes individuals who cross cultural boundaries.  On Sunday, Rapp, now 46, accused Spacey of trying to seduce him while attending a party back in 1986.  ""He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don't, like, squirm away initially, because I'm like, 'What's going on?' And then he lays down on top of me,"" Rapp said in a BuzzFeed article published Sunday.  Spacey, who said he doesn't remember the incident, nonetheless apologized for his ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior"" in a post on Twitter later that night. In his tweet, he also revealed that he has ""loved and had romantic encounters with men"" and that he chooses ""now to live as a gay man.""  Despite his apology, which was widely criticized for his coming out under these circumstances, the producers of his Netflix show ""House of Cards"" announced today that they were suspending production on the show.  ""MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on HOUSE OF CARDS season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew,"" Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio that created ""House of Cards"" with the streaming service, said in a joint statement.  On Monday, the producers said they were meeting with the cast and crew to ""ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported,"" adding that ""Spacey is not working on the set at this time.""  Netflix also confirmed to ABC News that the upcoming season 6 would be the series' last. A Netflix representative confirmed to ABC News that the decision to end the show after season six was made before the scandal broke."	0
Orlando Bloom is a popular British actor and heartthrob known for his roles in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.  Who Is Orlando Bloom? Born on January 13, 1977, in Canterbury, England, Orlando Bloom studied acting as a child before he was cast as the heroic Legolas in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bloom also found major success starring in three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp. He's landed other roles in big-screen fare, including Troy, Elizabethtown and The Three Musketeers. Orlando Bloom (Photo: WireImage)  Movies  'The Lord of the Rings' Days before his graduation, Bloom was cast in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The first film of the trilogy, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring, was a huge blockbuster and critical success. Bloom went on to perform in the two Ring follow-ups; he plays Legolas Greenleaf, a long-haired immortal elf who balances refinement and wisdom with sharp archery and camaraderie, throughout the popular film series. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' Franchise After garnering a noted role in Black Hawk Down (2001), another big part was on the horizon for Bloom. In 2003 he starred as the sensitive Will Turner in the Disney action/adventure The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, alongside Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Pirates marked another huge world blockbuster for Bloom, who would go on to star in the next two sequels of the franchise: Dead's Man Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007). ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Troy,' 'Elizabethtown' Bloom continued doing period work, playing Paris in the 2004 film Troy, which also stars Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. The following year, the actor was featured as a leading man in two films: Ridley Scott's Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven and Cameron Crowe's drama Elizabethtown (both released in 2005). Then, in 2006, Bloom appeared with actress Zoe Saldana in the thriller Haven, which he also co-produced. In between his more high-profile Hollywood work, Bloom has starred in indie fare like Ned Kelley (2003) and New York, I Love You (2009). Additionally, in 2007, he returned to the stage for a London revival of In Celebration. 'The Three Musketeers,' 'The Hobbit' Another cape-and-sword opportunity arose for Bloom when he was cast in a 2011 update of The Three Musketeers, which failed to catch hold at the U.S. box office. The actor then returned to working with Jackson, reprising his role as Greenleaf for portions of The Hobbit film trilogy, the first installment of which was released in December 2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Bloom reprised his role as Will Turner for a fifth time in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and showed his sense of humor in the Andy Samberg-led mockumentary Tour de Pharmacy, playing the character Juju Pepe. In 2018 he starred in the British-Chinese thriller action flick S.M.A.R.T. Chase.	1
Just as important as the Met Gala theme reveal—next year’s show is titled “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”—is the announcement of Anna Wintour’s cohosts. Taking over the duties carried out last time around by Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Gisele Bündchen, and Tom Brady are three women who are as talented as they are glamorous: Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace.  The big question, of course, is what will they wear? While we count down to the big night—May 7, 2018—we look back at each woman’s personal Met Gala history searching for clues.  Amal Clooney  Met Gala Debut: 2015  Galas Attended: 1  Clooney made a stunning party-of-the-year debut in a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal gown by John Galliano. Its deep red color was presumably a nod to the exhibition’s theme, “China: Through the Looking Glass,” but this dress was an homage to the wearer. Strapless with a corset-like top, its skirt flared slightly in a cascade of tiers creating the narrow, figure-flattering silhouette Clooney prefers.  Advertisement 1 / 7  Rihanna  Met Gala Debut: 2007  Galas Attended: 7  Gala Performances: 2  Rihanna is a Met Gala all-star: No one gets more into the spirit of things than @badgalriri. Consider the yolk-color Guo Pei gown she wore to the 2015 event that not only put the Chinese designer on the map, but also blew up the memosphere. For anyone other than Rihanna, that look would have been a tough one to top, but she managed, arriving at this year’s Comme des Garçons exhibition in a fresh-off-the-runway look by the woman of the hour, Rei Kawakubo. By now, we know to expect the unexpected from Rihanna—even an impromptu performance, like the one she gave with Kanye West in 2009.  Advertisement 1 / 16  Donatella Versace  Met Gala Debut (on record): 1995  Galas Attended: 16  In 1997, the Costume Institute remembered Gianni Versace’s life and work with an exhibition. This year, to mark the 20th anniversary of her brother’s death, Donatella Versace presented a tribute collection to her brother for Spring 2018. Next May, she’ll cohost the gala that she used to attend by his side. While we know what Donatella will wear—one of her own glamorous creations, cierto—precisely which A-listers will form her entourage remains to be seen.

This Behind-the-Scenes “Assassination of Gianni Versace” Teaser Will Give You Chills  After giving true-crime fans a full trailer for the show last month, the producers of The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story are keeping the hype going by releasing a new teaser. With less than three weeks to go until the January 17 premiere, the show is digging a bit deeper into the mystery with a behind-the-scenes look explaining why this shocking murder is truly a perfect American crime to dissect 20 years later.  “This particular manhunt is the largest failed FBI manhunt in history,” actor Darren Criss tells us in the video. The failed manhunt centers around Criss’ character, Andrew Cunanan, a hustler and grifter who landed in Miami after a killing spree that saw at least four closeted gay men dead throughout the Midwest. Cunanan’s crimes were tangled with his fear of being outed and his use of his sexuality to control his victims by telling them he would out them to their families if they didn’t go along with him.  Before heading to Florida, Cunanan was put on the FBI’s most wanted list. When they didn’t track him to the coastal city in time, Cunanan managed to kill fashion designer Versace on the steps of his Miami home. The killer eventually took his own life without ever being arrested.  Executive producer Nina Jacobson says that in choosing the crimes they dramatize for ACS, they want to explore how these issues affect all Americans, and not just those at the center of the crimes. In The Assassination of Gianni Versace, the show looks at gay culture and how Americans treated gay men, the AIDS epidemic, and more in the ’90s, all culminating with Cunanan’s killing spree.  “People were scared at the fact that this man was killing gay men,” Ricky Martin, who plays Versace’s partner Antonio D’Amico, says in the clip. “Still some people don’t understand why it happened.” Executive producer Brad Simpson agrees, saying, “Andrew’s journey is a journey through politics of homosexuality as they played across America in the 1990s.”  “The truth is,” Criss quips, “fear and prejudice, unfortunately, is always in fashion.”  Will you watch this season of American Crime Story?

"Kelly Ripa came to the defense of her embattled “Live!” co-host Ryan Seacrest on Thursday by declaring on the air: “I just want you to know, you are a privilege to work with, and I adore you.”  see also Kelly Ripa stands by Ryan Seacrest ""I feel very, very lucky to work with you each...  She added that she is looking forward to seeing Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet, and, “Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what an easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day.”  Seacrest has denied claims that he sexually harassed his former stylist Suzie Hardy while she was employed by the E! network.  Ripa’s endorsement came just a day after she appeared to take a dig at Seacrest on the show, with regards to the sexual-misconduct allegations plaguing him.  And insiders tell us that the duo’s relationship is not as sunny as it seemed on the show Thursday.  Said a source: “Kelly doesn’t want to risk anything happening to ‘Live’ . . . She is understandably livid because it could potentially f - - k up her show.”  Another added, “They oversell their friendship . . . Her reputation is rolled up in this — this is her show. For Kelly, there’s not a Plan B. She has to make a decision and rally around him.”  Reps did not comment, but another source insisted, “He’s one of her closest friends, and they’re very protective of each other. They’ve known each other for years and talk about everything . . . it’s been a tough week.”  E! is sticking with Seacrest as a red-carpet Oscars host, though sources told Page Six some stars may steer clear of him, while the network will line up only friendly interviews.

Have you been hearing a lot about facial mists, setting sprays, and primer sprays lately and wondering what all the hype is about? Many women swear by spritzing their face with these types of products for a variety of reasons. Depending on which one you use, a facial mist, setting spray, or primer spray can help to perk up tired-looking skin, set your makeup, prep your skin for face makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration—which can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. But generally, all skin types can reap the benefits of a facial mist or setting spray. Ready to add one to your beauty routine? Keep reading to find out more about what they can do!  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACE SPRAYS AND MISTS?  Wondering what exactly the difference is between all of the types of face sprays we’ve mentioned already? Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk—refreshing facial mists are about to become your skin’s new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It’s time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they’re meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you’re looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!  Now you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren’t sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We’re breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.  ADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  A facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn’t sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.  Even if you’re feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry. A quick misting can give dry skin the extra boost it needs. This is particularly helpful during those cold, winter months when skin tends to get dull.  HOW TO USE A FACIAL MIST  We promise: It’s so easy! Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn’t interfere with your makeup). That’s it!  ADD A SETTING SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  When you want to rock a “just applied” makeup look all day and night, a setting spray is the way to go! When your contour and your smoky eye are on point, we understand that you’ll try just about anything to maintain your look from desk to drinks. Instead of constantly reapplying or worrying about any makeup faux pas, make locking in your look with a setting spray as the last step in your makeup routine. A setting spray will increase your makeup’s lifespan—which means you can dance the night away without the fear of sweating your foundation off.  A setting spray can also come through in the clutch if you have oily skin. If you do have oily skin, chances are you’re layering on powder makeup to help your makeup stay put throughout the day. A setting spray can help soften the look of all the products you’ve previously applied—giving you the seamless look you’re after! Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.  HOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY  Once you’re done applying all of your makeup—foundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it—lightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup and keep your look lasting even longer.

She’s back and ready to win that Mirrorball Trophy!  Cheryl Burke will be returning for the 25th season of Dancing with the Stars — her 20th season competing on the reality dance competition series — the pro dancer confirmed Monday on Instagram.  Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty  “Guess who’s back in the ballroom?! So excited to share that I’m officially back for my 20th season of Dancing With the Stars!” wrote Burke, 33.  “This dance floor will always be my home and I’ve got my eyes on that mirror ball ⭐️,” she continued, adding the hashtags “#bringonthespraytans #dwts.”  WATCH: Chloe Lukasiak On New ‘Dance Moms’ Coach Cheryl Burke: ‘She Was Incredible’  Burke is joining 12 fellow pros that were announced last week: Alan Bersten, Keo Motsepe, Artem Chigvintsev, Maks ChmerkovskiyVal Chmerkovskiy, Gleb Savchenko, Mark Ballas, Lindsay Arnold, Peta Murgatroyd, Emma Slater, Sharna Burgess and Witney Carson.  Burke, who has taken home two Mirrorball Trophies throughout her time on the ABC series (season 2 with Drew Lachey and season 3 with Emmitt Smith), last competed on season 23 with Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte.  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with The Stars’ is out Sept. 15.  After it was confirmed in February that Burke would not be returning for the 24th season of DWTS, PEOPLE learned that she joined Dance Moms as dance after instructor Abby Lee Miller abruptly quit and announced her departure on social media, claiming she had been “manipulated and disrespected” by producers.  Since taking over the reins of the Lifetime series in March, Burke has taken a vastly different approach to teaching her Dance Moms students.  “I am approaching it differently. I don’t scream or yell — I don’t believe in that,” Burke previously told Steve Harvey. “But don’t get me wrong, I’m still — from people that have seen me on Dancing with the Stars — I am still strict, I’m stern and I expect the best out of my students. But I do it in a way that’s loving and it’s caring, and I try not to intimidate them or traumatize the kids.”  Season 25 of Dancing with the Stars premieres Sept. 18 on ABC.	1

RELATED: Matt Bomer Says His Sons’ Style Is “Very Uniquely California”: “They Always Surprise Us”  Bomer says that he and his husband aren’t necessarily steering their three sons — they also share 10-year-old twins Henry and Walker — away from a future in Hollywood, and that one of the boys “definitely likes to entertain” already.  RELATED VIDEO: Matt Bomer Opens Up About His Marriage  “[He’s] very socially confident and has that vibe,” the actor explained to PEOPLE Now last year. “I would encourage them to do it at school, in safe environments where they can really explore the material in a way that’s not just for public consumption.”  He continued, “And then maybe when they’re 18, if that’s a choice they wanna make, they can make that choice.”	0
The couple closed out 2017 on vacation in Cabo San Lucas with friends Jason Bateman and his wife Amanda Anka. Almost two months later, they announced their split, which they said in a statement to the Associated Press, occured at the end of 2017.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” Aniston’s longtime publicist Stephen Huvane said in a statement. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”	0
Alicia Silverstone  Looking at this picture, it's hard to believe that it's been 19 years since Alicia Silverstone popped into our lives as Cher in Clueless.

Listen—we have nothing against lawyers, accountants, and teachers. We’re sure they’re all hardworking people. But when dad or mom works in a small cubicle of a boring office, it doesn’t matter how much you love them, there simply isn’t anything exciting about Take Your Kids To Work Day.  On the other hand, when mommy is a music goddess or a fashion guru, or when daddy is a soccer superstar or the best quarterback in history, visiting them at work suddenly becomes a thousand times better than a trip to Disneyland! Because, for these famous parents, a Super Bowl halftime show and the finale of the UEFA Champions League is their version of work.  Celebrating Take Our Sons and Daughter to Work Day, here are 11 pictures of the lucky celebrity offspring watching mom and dad in lavish action!	0

In 2005, she went on to produce, write and star in the HBO comedy series The Comeback, which was revived nine years later for a second season. Kudrow received two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series nominations for both seasons.  Kudrow produced and starred in the Showtime program Web Therapy (2011–2015), which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. She is also one of the executive producers of the TLC reality program Who Do You Think You Are, which gained three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program.  Kudrow has also made several notable film appearances, including roles in Analyze This (1999), Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), P.S. I Love You (2007), Bandslam (2008), Hotel for Dogs (2009), Easy A (2010), Neighbors (2014) and its sequel Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016), The Girl on the Train (2016), and The Boss Baby (2017).  Early life [ edit ]  Lisa Kudrow was born in Los Angeles, California, to Nedra S. (née Stern, born 1934), a travel agent, and Lee N. Kudrow (born 1933), a physician who specialized in the treatment of headaches.[3] She has an older sister, Helene Marla (born 1955), and an older brother, Santa Monica neurologist David B. Kudrow (born 1957). Kudrow was raised in a middle-class Jewish family and had a Bat Mitzvah ceremony.[4][5] Her ancestors emigrated from Belarus, Germany, Hungary and Poland,[6] and some of them lived in the village of Ilya, in the Minsk area. Kudrow's paternal grandparents were David Kudrow (born in Mogilev, Belarus) and Gertrude Farberman (born in Ilya, Belarus).[6] Her paternal great-grandmother, Mera Mordejovich, was murdered in Ilya during the Holocaust. Her paternal grandmother immigrated to Brooklyn, where her father grew up.[7][8]  Kudrow attended Portola Middle School in Tarzana, California. In 1979, at the age of 16, she underwent rhinoplasty to reduce the size of her nose.[9] She graduated from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles where then N.W.A. member Ice Cube also attended. Kudrow received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology from Vassar College, intending to follow in her father's footsteps and research headaches.[citation needed] Kudrow worked on her father's staff for eight years while breaking into acting, earning a research credit on his study on the comparative likelihood of left-handed individuals developing cluster headaches.[10]  Career [ edit ]  1989–1994: Early career [ edit ]  At the urging of her brother's childhood friend, comedian Jon Lovitz,[4] she began her comedic career as a member of The Groundlings, an improv and sketch comedy school in Los Angeles. Kudrow has credited Cynthia Szigeti, her improv teacher at The Groundlings, for changing her perspective on acting, calling her ""the best thing that happened, on so many levels.""[11][12] Briefly, Kudrow joined with Conan O'Brien and director Tim Hillman in the short-lived improv troupe Unexpected Company.[13] She was also the only regular female member of the Transformers Comedy Troupe.[14] She played a role in an episode of the NBC sitcom Cheers.[15] She tried out for Saturday Night Live in 1990, but the show chose Julia Sweeney instead.[16] She had a recurring role as Kathy Fleisher in three episodes of season one of the Bob Newhart sitcom Bob (CBS, 1992–1993), a role she played after taking part in the memorable series finale of Newhart's previous series Newhart.[17] Prior to Friends, she appeared in at least two produced network pilots: NBC's Just Temporary (also known as Temporarily Yours) in 1989, playing Nicole; and CBS' Close Encounters (also known as Matchmaker) in 1990, playing a Valley girl.[3]  Kudrow was cast to play the role of Roz Doyle in Frasier, but the role was re-cast with Peri Gilpin during the taping of the pilot episode. Kudrow said in 2000 that when rehearsals started, ""I knew it wasn't working. I could feel it all slipping away, and I was panicking, which only made things worse.""[4] Her first recurring television role was Ursula Buffay, the eccentric waitress on the NBC sitcom Mad About You. Kudrow would reprise the character on the NBC sitcom Friends, in which Kudrow co-starred as massage therapist Phoebe Buffay, Ursula's twin sister.[18]  1994–2004: Breakthrough [ edit ]  For her starring role as Phoebe on Friends (NBC, 1994–2004) Kudrow won the 1998 Emmy Award[19] for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. According to the Guinness Book of World Records (2005), Kudrow and co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox became the highest paid TV actresses of all time, earning $1 million per episode for the ninth and tenth seasons of Friends.[20] During her tenure on Friends Kudrow appeared in multiple comedic films such as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Hanging Up, Marci X, Dr. Dolittle 2, Analyze This and its sequel Analyze That, and dramatic films, such as Wonderland and The Opposite of Sex.  She also guest starred on numerous television series during Friends, including The Simpsons, Hope and Gloria, King of the Hill, and hosting Saturday Night Live.  2004–present: Post-Friends [ edit ]  Kudrow starred as protagonist Valerie Cherish on the single-season HBO series The Comeback (premiered June 5, 2005), about a has-been sitcom star trying for a comeback. She also served as co-creator, writer, and executive producer. The series was cancelled by HBO before being renewed for a second season nearly a decade after being originally cancelled. Kudrow received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on The Comeback.[21]  Kudrow serves as the executive producer for the American version of the UK television series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which celebrities trace their family trees. The subjects of the first series included Kudrow herself, in which it was discovered her great-grandmother died in the Holocaust.[22][23]  Kudrow co-created an improvised comedy web series, Web Therapy on Lstudio.com. The improv series, which launched online in 2008, has earned several Webby nominations and one Outstanding Comedic Performance Webby for Kudrow, who plays therapist of unspecified credentials Fiona Wallice. She offers her patients three-minute sessions over iChat.[21] In July 2011, a reformatted, half-hour version of the show premiered on Showtime,[24][25] before being cancelled in 2015 after four seasons.[26] Kudrow has guest starred on multiple television series such as Cougar Town, BoJack Horseman, Angie Tribeca, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Scandal.[27]  Following Friends, Kudrow has also appeared in films such as Easy A, Hotel for Dogs, Happy Endings, and Neighbors. In 2016, she reprised her role as Carol Gladstone in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,[28] and co-starred in the thriller film The Girl on the Train.[29]  Personal life [ edit ]  On May 27, 1995, Kudrow married Michel Stern, a French advertising executive. They have one son, Julian Murray Stern, who was born on May 7, 1998. [30][31] Kudrow's pregnancy was written into Friends (seasons 4 and 5), with her character Phoebe having triplets as a surrogate mother for her brother Frank and his wife Alice because they were not able to have children. Her fluency in French was also written into Phoebe's character as she struggled to teach Joey.[32]  Filmography [ edit ]  Kudrow at the film premiere of The Other Woman in 2009  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  Kudrow has been honored with numerous accolades over her career. For her role in the sitcom Friends, she received six nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards, winning in 1996 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

Caitlyn Jenner has undergone a physical milestone in her transition.  In her new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, the gold medal-winning Olympian–who confirmed her transition from male to female and revealed her new identity as Caitlyn in June 2015–says that she underwent gender reassignment surgery in January 2017, PEOPLE has confirmed.  “The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,” she writes in the memoir, according to RadarOnline, calling the decision to undergo the surgery “complex.”  Jenner says she decided to be open about the surgery in order to stop the questions and inquiries about when — or if — she would have it done.  “I am telling you because I believe in candor,” she says. “So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Caitlyn Jenner Considered Sex Change in 1985, Ex-Wife Linda Thompson Reveals  “I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.”  “Gender confirmation surgery is something I think anybody in my position, or the girls’ position, of course you look into,” Jenner previously said of undergoing the surgery on a 2016 episode of I Am Cait. “For me, I have no idea what the future holds.”  In October 2016, Jenner legally changed her name to Caitlyn Marie and her gender to female.  The Secrets of My Life is available April 25.	1

In a couple of weeks, some say even days, Pippa Middleton will give birth to her first child. It's definitely an exciting and very busy time for the expectant mother, but she's not letting her pregnancy slow down her style game. Yesterday, the 35-year-old English socialite took a fashion-forward trip to the grocery store. And we are taking notes — pregnant or not — because she has found the formula for an easy-going on-trend outfit.  Middleton's maternity uniform boils down to three elements: a perfect pair of sneakers, a loose-fitting dress, and a large tote. Most recently, she made heads turn in a flowy Ralph Lauren polka-dot dress ($398; mytheresa.com), which was anchored with trendy white sneakers. She consistently returns to her comfortable, investment-worthy Jimmy Choo sneakers ($495; saks.com). We've spotted her wearing them over and over again.

"Rashida Jones, pictured Oct. 14 at the Los Angeles premiere of the play ""Sell/Buy/Date,"" will executive produce a potential new television series for AMC. (Rachel Luna/Getty Images)  It’s been a little over a year since “Kevin Can Wait” killed off Erinn Hayes’s character after just one season, a very weird move, given that she played a lead character — Donna Gable, Kevin’s wife of 20 years. To add fuel to the fire burning inside upset viewers' hearts, the CBS sitcom replaced Hayes with Leah Remini, Kevin James’s former co-star from “King of Queens.” Ratings took a dip, and the network eventually axed the show in May.  Donna, while a high-profile case, wasn’t the only mistreated wife in sitcom history, and this hasn’t gone unnoticed. AMC Networks announced Friday that it has a project in development called “Kevin Can F*** Himself,” from creator Valerie Armstrong and executive producers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack.  The series aims to expose “the secret life of a woman we all grew up watching: the sitcom wife,” the network said in a statement. “A beauty paired with a less attractive, dismissive, caveman-like husband who gets to be a jerk because she’s a nag and he’s ‘funny.'"" The show aims to illuminate said secret life by switching between “single-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness.”  Hayes even tweeted about it:  This project is the second buzzed about this week that directly challenges long-established Hollywood tropes. The first? “Isn’t It Romantic,” an upcoming movie that centers on a cynical woman (Rebel Wilson) who faces her worst nightmare when she gets trapped in a cheesy romantic comedy. (Yes, the same movie Wilson was promoting when she incorrectly claimed to be the “first-ever plus-sized girl” to lead a rom-com.)  AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom — as well as workplace drama “Rainy Day People” — under its “script-to-series” development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts.  “Under the approach, AMC foregoes the traditional pilot process and instead opens writers' rooms to develop scripts for several episodes and a detailed look at a potential first season before deciding whether to move to a straight-to-series order,” Deadline reported last year.  So while there’s no guarantee “Kevin Can F*** Himself” will make it to the finish line, AMC programming president David Madden did note that the network has had “great experiences” with the creative team behind it. Things are looking up. We (Kevin) Can’t Wait!  Read more:  Wondering how ‘Kevin Can Wait’ will get rid of Erinn Hayes?

To qualify, you must be over 65, retired, receive social security and have an income under $40K per year.The stimulus, part of the yearly discretionary budget to use at the discretion of the Chief Executive, is the remainder of the till for 2017. Each recipient will receiveThe letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable. White House Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Trubolls, says the fine-print is there for a reason:“If you ask liberals to pledge support for the office of the President they’ll start burning down their own cities. Unless there’s a black man, a gay person or a woman in the Oval Office they’ll never be satisfied. They call Trump a racist but he’s vilified every day for being a white male. It’s hypocrisy at its finest.”President Trump already enjoys the highest approval rating of any president of all time among seniors in this country. There’s a reason for that. With age comes wisdom. Just look at President Trump’s supporters. They’re as American as it gets.The letters will be sent sometime this coming week. If you don’t get yours, call the White House switchboard at (202) 456-1414 and let them know.	1
"The royal descendants of Victoria (Queen of the United Kingdom) and of Christian IX (King of Denmark) currently occupy the thrones of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. At the outbreak of the First World War their grandchildren occupied the thrones of Denmark, Greece, Norway, Germany, Romania, Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom. For this, Queen Victoria was nicknamed ""the grandmother of Europe"" while King Christian IX was nicknamed ""Father-in-law of Europe"". Of the remaining kingdoms of Europe today, only Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands descends neither from Queen Victoria nor King Christian IX.[1]  Grandchildren [ edit ]  Queen Victoria arranged the marriage of her eldest son and heir-apparent, the future Edward VII, to Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of King Christian IX, which took place on 10 March 1863. Among their six children were George V (who was also Emperor of India throughout his reign) and his sister Maud of Wales (who would later marry their cousin King Haakon VII of Norway, another grandchild of Christian IX, on 22 July 1896). However, these two marriages were not the only unions amongst and between descendants of Victoria and Christian IX.  The second son of Christian IX, Prince William, became King of Greece as George I shortly after his sister Alexandra's marriage due to this new connection with the British Royal Family. On 27 October 1889 his son, later Constantine I of Greece, married Sophia of Prussia, a granddaughter of Victoria, forging another union between descendants of the British queen and the Danish king.  In 1865, Christian IX's second daughter, Princess Dagmar, became engaged to Tsarevich Nicholas of Russia, son and heir of Tsar Alexander II. Following the untimely death of her fiancé, Dagmar married Nicholas's younger brother, the Tsarevich Alexander in 1866, taking the Russian name Maria Feodorovna. Between 1881 and 1894, she was empress-consort of Russia. Her son, Nicholas II of Russia, married Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, yet another granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on 26 November 1894, and she became empress-consort as Alexandra Feodorovna.  Other grandchildren became monarchs in their own right or consorts. Christian X of Denmark was the elder brother of Haakon VII of Norway and thus another grandson of Christian IX of Denmark. William II, German Emperor and King of Prussia was the elder brother of Sophia of Prussia and thus another reigning grandson of Victoria. Lastly, Victoria had two more granddaughters who became queens: Marie of Edinburgh, who married Ferdinand I of Romania, and Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg who married Alfonso XIII of Spain.  Christian IX was therefore the grandfather of an emperor and two kings who all married granddaughters of Victoria, one of whom (Maud of Wales) was also a granddaughter of Christian IX. In total, five of his grandsons were reigning sovereigns.  Victoria, meanwhile, was the grandmother of an emperor, a king-emperor, four queens consort and an empress consort.  First World War [ edit ]  During the First World War (1914–1918), many monarchs of countries from both sides were closely related due to their mutual descent from either Queen Victoria, King Christian IX or both. The most commonly cited example is the fact that Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany were all first cousins of King George V of the United Kingdom.[2][3][4] Other countries who fought against Germany in addition to Russia and the United Kingdom were Romania, whose queen-consort, Marie, wife of King Ferdinand I, was a cousin of the Kaiser, and Greece, whose queen-consort, Sophia, wife of King Constantine I, was the Kaiser's own sister.  Additionally, King George V was a first cousin, through King Christian IX, of both Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and King Constantine I of Greece. Shortly before the end of the war, Nicholas, his wife and children were executed by the Bolsheviks. Other first cousins of George V, whose countries were neutral during the war, were King Christian X of Denmark, Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain (queen-consort of King Alfonso XIII) and King Haakon VII of Norway (who was also George's brother-in-law via his marriage to George's sister, Maud).  Family tree of sovereign and consort grandchildren [ edit ]  The family tree below also attempts to show the relationship between close and extended family members referenced on this page.  Present-day reigning descendants [ edit ]  The unions between descendants of Queen Victoria and of King Christian IX did not end with the First World War, despite the overthrows of both the German and Russian monarchies (along with House of Habsburg in Austria-Hungary). On the contrary, nearly all European reigning kings and queens today are most closely related through their descent from Victoria, Christian or both.  Currently, there are seven kingdoms remaining in Europe:[5]  1. Belgium: King Philippe & Queen Mathilde  2. Denmark: Queen Margrethe II  3. Norway: King Harald V & Queen Sonja  4. Spain: King Felipe VI & Queen Letizia  5. Sweden: King Carl XVI Gustaf & Queen Silvia  6. United Kingdom: Queen Elizabeth II & Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh  7. Netherlands: King Willem-Alexander & Queen Máxima  King Harald V of Norway, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and King Felipe VI of Spain are all descended from both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX. The first two monarchs are great-grandchildren of the aforementioned union between Alexandra of Denmark (daughter of King Christian IX) and Edward VII (son of Queen Victoria). Harald V of Norway is actually descended from Christian IX three ways, twice through his father and once through his mother. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and his wife Elizabeth II are second cousins once removed through Christian IX and also third cousins as they are both great-great-grandchildren of Victoria. Margrethe II of Denmark is descended once each from Victoria and Christian IX. She is also a first cousin to Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden through Victoria's granddaughter Princess Margaret of Connaught. Felipe VI is descended from Victoria three ways and Christian IX twice. His father, King Juan Carlos I, is descended from Victoria and not Christian IX, while Juan Carlos' consort, Queen Sofía, is twice a descendant of Victoria and twice a great-great-granddaughter of Christian IX.  King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is descended from Victoria, twice, as his parents were second cousins because they were both great-grandchildren of Victoria. in addition, Carl XVI Gustaf also descends on his maternal side from Victoria's half-sister Feodora. Although Carl XVI Gustaf is not a descendant of Christian IX; however, it should be noted that he descends on his maternal side from the parents of Christian IX through Christian IX's elder brother, Friedrich.  Conversely, Philippe, King of the Belgians is descended from King Christian IX but not Queen Victoria, although, he is a descendant of Victoria's maternal uncle (as well as her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's paternal uncle), Leopold I, King of the Belgians. Philippe's father, King Albert II, who abdicated in the summer of 2013, is a first cousin to Harald V of Norway through their grandfather Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, married to Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, a granddaughter of Christian IX.  In summation, the monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom as well as the consort of the United Kingdom are descended from both Victoria and Christian IX. The King of Sweden is descended from Victoria and not Christian IX (although from one of his brothers). The King of the Belgians and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg are descended from Christian IX and not Victoria, though they are descendants of both Victoria's and her spouse's uncle Leopold I of Belgium. The King of the Netherlands is the only monarch descended from neither Victoria nor Christian IX. (He is, however, a sixth cousin thrice removed of Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Harald V, Margrethe II and Carl XVI Gustaf through descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales; a sixth cousin four times removed of Felipe VI, also via descent from Frederick; and also a fourth cousin twice removed of Albert II through descent from William I of the Netherlands. Furthermore, William I of the Netherlands was also second cousin once removed to both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX, since he was the great-grandson of George II of Great Britain. Hence, all current reigning kings and queens in Europe, including the Netherlands, are related through the line of George II of Great Britain.)  Monarchs descended from Queen Victoria [ edit ]  Monarchs descended from King Christian IX [ edit ]  Notes  Common ancestry between Victoria and Christian IX [ edit ]  Because so many monarchs descend from both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark, the relationship between these two monarchs is of some interest. These monarchs were third cousins through their mutual descent from King George II of Great Britain. This relationship occurs twice because the maternal grandparents of King Christian IX of Denmark, Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (1744–1836) and Princess Louise of Denmark (1750–1831), were both children of daughters of King George II of Great Britain (1660–1727), and thus first cousins. Louise of Hesse-Kassel, wife of King Christian IX of Denmark, was a granddaughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse (1747–1837), the brother of the aforementioned Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel.  Thus King Christian IX of Denmark and his wife Louise of Hesse-Kassel were second cousins to each other and third cousins to Queen Victoria.

"Sweeney Todd, see This article is about the film. For the song sometimes known as ""Pretty Woman"", see Oh, Pretty Woman . For the song in the musical, see Pretty Women  Not to be confused with Pretty Lady (disambiguation)  Pretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features Hector Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles.[1] The film's story centers on down-on-her-luck Hollywood prostitute Vivian Ward, who is hired by Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of her week-long stay with him.  Originally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and sex work in Los Angeles, the film was reconceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. It was widely successful at the box office and was the third highest-grossing film of 1990. The film saw the highest number of ticket sales in the U.S. ever for a romantic comedy,[2] with Box Office Mojo listing it as the #1 romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets.[3] The film received positive reviews, with Roberts's performance being praised, for which she received a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition, screenwriter J. F. Lawton was nominated for a Writers Guild Award and a BAFTA Award.  Plot [ edit ]  High-powered businessman Edward Lewis has broken up with his girlfriend after an unpleasant phone call wherein he asked her to escort him during his business trip - she is offended that he treats her as his ""beck and call girl"". Edward is a corporate raider, who buys companies that are in financial trouble and tears down the company piece by piece. Leaving a business party in the Hollywood Hills, he takes his lawyer's Lotus Esprit sports car, and accidentally ends up on Hollywood Boulevard in the city's red-light district, where he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. Having difficulties driving the car, he asks her to get in and guide him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where he is staying. It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive. Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate. She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; later, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3,000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as paying for a new, more acceptable wardrobe for her. That evening, visibly moved by her transformation, Edward begins seeing Vivian in a different light. He begins to open up to her, revealing his personal and business lives.  Edward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal. His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met. Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished. Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement. Edward apologizes, and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate to whom Vivian paid attention at the match. Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways. Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see La Traviata at the San Francisco Opera. Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man. Vivian breaks her ""no kissing on the mouth"" rule (which her friend Kit taught her) and they have sex; in the aftermath, Vivian tells Edward she loves him, but he does not respond. Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets. Hurt, she refuses, says this is not the ""fairy tale"" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.  Meeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of ""raiding,"" Edward changes his mind. His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests working together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces. Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, wrestles Philip off her, punches him in the face and throws him out of the room.  With his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him, but because she wants to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. Edward re-thinks his life and has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from out the white limousine's sun roof and ""rescues her."" Edward asks, ""So what happens after he climbed up the tower and rescues her?"" to which Vivian responds, ""She rescues him right back.""  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  The film was initially conceived as a dark drama about sex work in Los Angeles in the 1980s.[4] The relationship between Vivian and Edward also originally involved controversial themes, including Vivian being addicted to drugs; part of the deal was that she had to stay off cocaine for a week. Edward eventually throws her out of his car and drives off. The original script by J.F. Lawton, called 3000,[5] ended with Vivian and her sex-worker friend on the bus to Disneyland.[4] Producer Laura Ziskin considered these elements detrimental to a sympathetic portrayal of Vivian, and they were removed or assigned to Kit. The deleted scenes have been found, and some were included on the DVD released for the film's 15th anniversary.[4] In one, Vivian tells Edward, ""I could just pop ya good and be on my way"", indicating her disinterest in ""pillow talk"". In another, she is confronted by drug dealers, then rescued by Edward.  Though inspired by such films as Wall Street and The Last Detail,[5] the film bears a resemblance to Pygmalion myths: particularly George Bernard Shaw's play of the same name, which also formed the basis for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It was Walt Disney Studios then-president Jeffrey Katzenberg who insisted the film be re-written as a modern-day fairy tale and love story, as opposed to the original dark drama. It was pitched to Touchstone Pictures and re-written as a romantic comedy.[6] The title 3000 was changed because Disney executives thought it sounded like a title for a science fiction film.[7]  The film is one of two movies that triggered a resurgence of romantic comedy in Hollywood, the other being When Harry Met Sally. Following this film's success, Roberts became the romantic comedy queen of the 1990s.  Casting [ edit ]  Casting of the film was a rather lengthy process. Marshall had initially considered Christopher Reeve, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Denzel Washington for the role of Edward, and Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds turned it down.[8] Pacino went as far as doing a casting reading with Roberts before rejecting the part.[9] Gere initially refused but when he met with Roberts, she persuaded him and he eventually agreed to play Lewis.[10] He reportedly started off much more active in his role; but Garry Marshall took him aside and said ""No, no, no, Richard. In this movie, one of you moves and one of you does not. Guess which one you are?""[11] Julia Roberts was not the first choice for the role of Vivian, and was not wanted by Disney. Many other actresses were considered. Marshall originally envisioned Karen Allen for the role; when she declined, auditions went to many better-known actresses of the time including Molly Ringwald,[12] who turned it down because she felt uncomfortable playing a sex worker.[citation needed] Winona Ryder auditioned, but was turned down because Marshall felt she was ""too young"". Jennifer Connelly was also dismissed for the same reason.[4]  Meg Ryan, who was a top choice of Marshall's, turned it down as well. According to a note written by Marshall, Mary Steenburgen was also among the first choices. Diane Lane came very close to being cast (the script was much darker at the time); they had gone as far as costume fittings, but due to scheduling conflicts she could not accept. Michelle Pfeiffer turned the role down, saying she did not like the script's ""tone.""[13] Daryl Hannah was also considered, but believed the role was ""degrading to women"".[13] Valeria Golino declined, doubting it would work with her thick Italian accent.[citation needed] And Jennifer Jason Leigh had auditioned.[14] When all the other actresses turned down the role, 21-year-old Julia Roberts, a relative unknown, with only the sleeper hit Mystic Pizza (1988) and the yet-to-be-released Steel Magnolias (1989) to her credit, won the role of Vivian. Her performance made her a star. J.F. Lawton, writer of the original screenplay, has suggested that the film was ultimately given a happy ending because of the chemistry of Gere and Roberts.[5]  Veteran actor Ralph Bellamy, who plays James Morse, appears in his final acting performance before his death in 1991.  Filming [ edit ]  The film's budget was substantial, at $14 million, so producers could shoot in many locations.[4] Most filming took place in Los Angeles, California, specifically in Beverly Hills, and inside soundstages at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The escargot restaurant the ""Voltaire"" was shot at the restaurant ""Rex,"" now called ""Cicada"". Scenes set in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lobby were shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Filming commenced on July 24, 1989, but was immediately plagued by problems. These included Ferrari and Porsche declining the product placement opportunity for the car Edward drove, neither firm wishing to be associated with sex workers.[4] Lotus Cars saw the placement value, and supplied a Silver 1989.5 Esprit SE (which was later sold).[15]  Shooting was a generally pleasant, easy-going experience, as the budget was broad and the shooting schedule was not tight.[4] While shooting the scene where Vivian is lying down on the floor of Edward's penthouse, watching reruns of I Love Lucy, Garry Marshall had to tickle Roberts' feet (out of camera range) to get her to laugh. The scene in which Gere playfully snaps the lid of a jewelry case on her fingers was improvised, and her surprised laugh was genuine. The red dress Vivian wears to the opera has been listed among the most unforgettable dresses of all time.[16]  During the scene in which Roberts sang to a Prince song in the bathtub, slid down and submerged her head under the bubbles; she emerged to find the crew had left except for the cameraman, who captured the moment on film. In the love scene, she was so stressed that a vein become noticeable on her forehead and had to be massaged by Marshall and Gere. She also developed a case of hives, and calamine lotion was used to soothe her skin until filming resumed.[4] The filming was completed on October 18.  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  In its opening weekend, the film was at number one at the box office, grossing $11,280,591 and averaging $8,513 per theater.[17] Despite dropping to number two in its second weekend, it grossed more with $12,471,670.[17] It was number one at the box office for four non-consecutive weeks, and in the Top 10 for 16 weeks.[17] It has grossed $178,406,268 in the United States and $285,000,000 in other countries for a total worldwide gross of $463,406,268.[18] It was also the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in the United States[19] and the third highest-grossing worldwide.[20] The film remains Disney's highest-grossing R-rated release ever.[21]  Critical response [ edit ]  The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 61% of 57 film critics have given it a positive review, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10. The site's consensus states, ""Pretty Woman may be a yuppie fantasy, but the film's slick comedy, soundtrack, and casting can overcome misgivings.""[22] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives it a score of 51 based on 17 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews.""[23]  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D, saying it ""starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy"" and with ""its tough-hooker heroine, it can work as a feminist version of an upscale princess fantasy."" Gleiberman also said it ""pretends to be about how love transcends money,"" but ""is really obsessed with status symbols.""[24] On its twentieth anniversary, Gleiberman wrote another article, saying that while he felt he was right, he would have given it a B today.[25] Carina Chocano of The New York Times said the movie ""wasn't a love story, it was a money story. Its logic depended on a disconnect between character and narrative, between image and meaning, between money and value, and that made it not cluelessly traditional but thoroughly postmodern.""[26]  Accolades [ edit ]  Awards  Nominations  Music [ edit ]  The film is noted for its musical selections. The hugely successful soundtrack features the song ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" by Roy Orbison, which inspired its title. Roxette's ""It Must Have Been Love"" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1990. The soundtrack also features ""King of Wishful Thinking"" by Go West, ""Show Me Your Soul"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""No Explanation"" by Peter Cetera, ""Wild Women Do"" by Natalie Cole and ""Fallen"" by Lauren Wood. The soundtrack went on to be certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[27]  The opera featured in the film is La Traviata, which also served as inspiration for its plot. The highly dramatic aria fragment that is repeated is the end of ""Dammi tu forza!"" (""Give me strength!""), from the opera. The piano piece Gere's character plays in the hotel lobby was actually composed by and performed by him. Roberts sings the song ""Kiss"" by Prince while she is in the tub and Gere's character is on the phone. Background music is composed by James Newton Howard. Entitled ""He Sleeps/Love Theme"", this piano composition is inspired by Bruce Springsteen's ""Racing in the Street"".

After receiving disappointingly low scores from the judges during the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Ashley Wagner spoke out against the judges who stood between her and her dream of competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics.  After Friday’s competition — in which Wagner finished in fourth place — she revealed that was was “absolutely furious,” according to The Salt Lake Tribune.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 26-year-old Olympic bronze medalist added that “For me to put out two programs that I did at this competition as solid as I skated and to get those scores, I am furious, and I think deservedly so.”  Matthew Stockman/Getty Images  “I honestly think that at the end of the day, this is how I feel, and I feel like I need to stick up for myself, and I think that I delivered when I really needed to,” Wagner continued. “I think all these girls delivered when they needed to, but I want to be on that Olympic team and I’m really mad that I’m in this position again.”  Although Wagner was given the chance to represent the United States at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi after finishing in fourth in the U.S. Championships that year — edging out skater Mirai Nagasu who had finished in third place — on Saturday it was announced that Wagner would not be so lucky again. She was named as Team USA’s first alternate.  RELATED VIDEO: Even Olympians Have Bad Days! Figure Skater Ashley Wagner Shares What Keeps Her Going  Wagner previously opened up to PEOPLE about what it would have meant to get to compete in the Pyeongchang Olympics as a 26-year-old woman.  “To be a 26-year-old woman on the ice is an achievement in this sport because you’re working against a lot of different things,” she said. “If I got to Pyeongchang, I will be the oldest U.S. female figure skating athlete since 1924 or something like that — so I think it really goes to show that my longevity is something that’s very, very rare. And I’m really proud of that, and it’s because I’m so freakin’ stubborn.”  And while the road to Pyeongchang was not always easy for the three-time national champion, Wagner never lost sight of her goal.  “I think that if anyone tells you that they’ve been that hungry every single day of their career, they’re not being honest,” Wagner added. “You have days where you don’t want to train. I mean, I’ve been skating for 22 years — this absolutely gets old. But it’s one of those things where I set a goal when I was 6, 7 years old and I owe it to that little girl … to see this through.”  Ashley Wagner Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  The 2018 Games, beginning on Feb. 8, would have been Wagner’s third Olympic experience. In addition to receiving a bronze medal at the team-skating event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, she was a first alternate at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  The three women who were chosen to compete for the United States in Pyeongchang next month are Bradie Tennell, Karen Chen and Mirai Nagasu — the figure skater who Wagner beat out for a spot on the Olympic team in 2014.	0

Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people – pedophiles.”  Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour.  Describing a party on tour – attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers – Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite.  “I didn’t want to do this. I really didn’t. They said this kid was drugged, it was horrible,” Bieber said, explaining that it was made clear to him that he would gain entry to the “business side of the industry” if he “joined the club” by passing the initiation rites.  “I wouldn’t just be a performer, I’d be a mogul. That path would open up for me, like it did for Jay-Z.”  “It’s the difference between being a millionaire and being a billionaire.”  But Bieber told the congregation that he couldn’t do it.  “To join the club I’d have to do bad things to this poor kid. But then I realized that even that wasn’t enough for them. I’d also have to kill this little child.”  Bieber said he had heard rumors about this type of initiation in the music industry, but he had not been confronted with it before.  “I got told they secretly film these parties. Once they’ve got you on video doing something like that, they own you.”  Bieber said his conscience is clear because he didn’t participate, but the fate of the drugged child is haunting him.  “They said this kid was raped by a few different guys. They said he was bleeding. I got out of there but I heard he died and that haunts me.”  This allegation from Justin Bieber adds to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and music industry system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman and Lindsay Lohan also spoke out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. But as more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision.	1
California is “the darkest state in the Union,” according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of “Biblical disasters” in recent times as punishment for “embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  “Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”  “First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  “Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“  “And now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,” Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey’s house.  “When they get hit with the ‘Big One‘, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, “then we will know that the End Times have truly begun.”  “And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.”  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn’t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year’s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.	1
Postby Guest » Thu Dec 21, 2017 12:26 am  He is looking for an intelligent, loyal companion. But he is always obsessed with design and wants to get a pet that is beautiful, stylish and moves great.  A rep for Pitt also laughed off the tail, er, tale.  Brad Pitt is getting a dog for companionship, according to a tabloid that is seemingly unaware he already has a dog. To exactly no one’s surprise, Gossip Cop can confirm this latest story about the actor was made-up.The piece in question can be found in the new edition of the National Enquirer, under the headline, “Brad Panting Over Dog!” The article begins by asserting the “lonely” Pitt is “on the hunt for a furry new friend!” A purported “top breeder” is quoted as saying, “Brad has been searching for a dog.“He seems to have narrowed his search down to a poodle or a Portuguese water dog,” continues the gossip magazine’s supposed tipster. While that may sound plausible, particularly since Pitt’s interest in design is well-known, the sourcing here is fishy. This alleged information comes from a purported “top breeder,” but the actor likely wouldn’t be working with a specific breeder yet if he doesn’t know which kind of dog he wants. Though standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs are considered somewhat similar canines, responsible breeders typically specialize in a single breed.What’s most strange is that nowhere does the outlet acknowledge that Pitt already has a pooch, and one that’s very different from poodles and Portuguese water dogs. The actor’s longtime pet is a bulldog, and the dog was actually mentioned multiple times in Pitt’s GQ cover story from earlier this year. In fact, Newsweek went as far as declaring Jacques was the “best thing” about the interview. Yet here’s the National Enquirer acting like he doesn’t even have a dog and suddenly needs to get one to stem his loneliness. Of course, it’s not out of the realm of possibility for Pitt to add another canine to his home, but that’s not even what the tabloid is claiming.Frankly, the supermarket tabloid has a lot of nerve claiming it knows anything about the star at all, after last year falsely accusing Pitt of beating Angelina Jolie and their kids. The magazine even doctored a photo to give Jolie a fake bruised appearance. It takes a lot of gall to write about Pitt, even on subjects as seemingly innocuous as getting a dog, after telling outright lies like that. And, for the record, Gossip Cop is told that no breeder legitimately connected to the actor leaked any real details about him getting a dog to this magazine.	1

"Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsay is known for his tough love methods on his Fox show Hell's Kitchen, but he was his own worst critic when it came to his weight.  In an interview with The Daily Mail, Ramsay shared how his wife, Tana, was his biggest source of motivation for losing weight because she has always been a fitness enthusiast and let him know she wasn't pleased with his weight gain, according to People.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  ""Tana was not impressed with the way I was,"" Ramsay revealed. ""I was overweight, 18 stone [over 250 pounds]. I looked like a sack of s--t. I look at the pictures and think, 'How did Tana stay around?' Because Tana has got better-looking and more gorgeous. And there she is, getting in bed with a fat f--k.""  Getty Images  Gordon and Tana have been married for over 20 years and have four children together, and at the time of his weight gain, he had just won his third Michelin star. But despite those accomplishments, Ramsay said he still suffered from low self-esteem.  ""It was painful,"" he said. ""I used to look at myself in the mirror and think, 'Holy s--t!' So it was a big wake-up call.""  The chef attributed his weight gain to not eating properly when working long hours and during vacation trips with David and Victoria Beckham and their respective families. ""I didn't have a figure,"" Ramsay said. ""I didn't feel that good. After working my a-- off and achieving a lot, I wanted to get in serious shape.""  Gordon Ramsay in June 2011. Getty Images  ""I don't want my industry to kill me,"" he continued. ""I know how unhealthy chefs are at the top level. Stress. Suicide. There's a big downside to cooking loads for a living. It's lethal: from obesity to heart attacks to cocaine habits.""  Around 2012, Ramsay began to make life change. ""I started focusing on getting super-fit five or six years ago when my life got super-busy,"" he told The Daily Mail. ""You get consumed by the work. You get sucked up. You get drawn in. All of a sudden your 'me time' is zero. There was no breathing space, no down time, no time to even think straight. It all started hitting me hard. I didn't panic, but my head was not in the game.""  Ramsay teamed up with a trainer named Will Usher who has him ride bikes in the home gym for an hour and do other workout regiments at least three times a week.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Since then, Ramsay has lost about 56 pounds and his weight has gone down to approximately 196 pounds. The 51-year-old said he stays inspired to lead a healthy lifestyle, because he does not want to die at a young age like his dad, who passed away at 53.  ""That's only a couple of years' time,"" he said. ""I've got this reminder to get fit, it's scary. I get the fear on a daily basis. I may have not got on with him, but I still miss him. I miss everything I could have had from him if he was still alive in his 70s.""  In December 2017, Ramsay released a book of his go-to recipes for when he eats well a home, titled Gordon Ramsay Ultimate Fit Food: Mouth-Watering Recipes to Fuel You for Life."	1
The Rock ‘n’ roll royalty has seemingly done yet another u-turn…  Little Richard has hinted that he’s against homosexuality in a new interview, years after coming out as a gay man.  The singer described same-sex relationships as “unnatural affection,” saying that he intends to live his final years “like Jesus”.  “Anybody come in show business, they’re going to say you’re gay. Are you straight? Are you a homosexual something? They’re going to say it,” Little Richard said during a sit down with 3ABN.  “But God, Jesus, he made men, men, he made women, women, you know? And you’ve got to live the way God wants you to live.”  He later added: “You know, all these things. So much unnatural affection. So much of people just doing everything and don’t think about God. Don’t want no parts of him.”  Little Richard – real name Richard Wayne Penniman – first came out publicly during an interview in 1995.  “I’ve been gay all my life and I know God is a God of love, not of hate,” he said at the time.  However, during a GQ interview in 2012, he elaborated further on how he sees his sexuality.  “We are all both male and female. Sex to me is like a smorgasbord. Whatever I feel like, I go for. What kind of sexual am I? I am omnisexual!”  But now at the age of 84, he seems to be denouncing his homosexuality altogether.	0
ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1

"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .)  Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life.""  Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!""  The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.""  While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps.""  Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that.""  Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed.  As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!""  During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter!  In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. ""I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!"" she laughed. ""I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!""  One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne.""  Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. ""She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!"" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? ""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother.  Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that. To be able to perform with the love of my life and in front of my brother for life and the beautiful Bindi was just cool.""  So what's next for Mark and BC? Their hit single, "" Roses and Violets ,"" has been climbing the charts, and the couple is recording an EP right now and hoping to get it out on tour. ""It's all Alexander Jean right now!""  Until, of course, season 22 comes along."	1
"Mother is the story of a couple's relationship that is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. From filmmaker Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream), Mother! stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in this riveting psychological thriller about love, devotion and sacrifice. (2017)  OSCAR-WINNING actress Jennifer Lawrence has suggested the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida were signs of “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for electing Donald Trump and not believing in man-made climate change.  Lawrence, who is promoting her new drama Mother!, appeared on British network Channel 4, where she discussed topics ranging from the movie to the gender pay gap and Mr Trump.  “It’s scary,” the actress responded to the interviewer’s assertion that there was “an end-of-days feeling” across the world and especially in the US.  “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming. I don’t even recognise it. It’s also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.”  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the reporter noted – to which Lawrence replied that “it was really startling” Mr Trump was elected.  She then suggested the recent hurricanes devastating Texas and nearing Florida may have been prompted by Mr Trump winning the presidency.  “You know, you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature’s rage and wrath,” Lawrence said.  Lawrence later said the conversation topics of Mr Trump and US politics were “really polarising and upsetting.”  “You know, I’ve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” she said.  After being asked whether she finds Mr Trump confusing, the actress fired back, saying, “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is.”  Lawrence has never been shy about sharing her opinions on the President.  In 2015, when Trump had just launched his presidential campaign, she said a victory by him would “be the end of the world,” during an Entertainment Weekly interview.  Social media users were quick to hit out at the star for politicising a natural disaster.  What a dumbass!! Typical Hollywood snowflake.

Queer Eye star Karamo Brown proposed to his boyfriend of eight years, Ian Jordan, on Wednesday, May 9 — and it’s safe to say they will have one stylish wedding.  Brown, 37, popped the question during Jordan’s surprise 40th birthday party at sbe’s HYDE Sunset in L.A. The Netflix series’ culture expert dropped down on one knee and presented his director love with a silver David Yurman band, Entertainment Tonight reported on Wednesday, May 9.  “You are the funniest man I know, the kindest man, my biggest cheerleader,” Brown told Jordan, per ET. “You made me feel like I could do anything. . . . I hope we can conquer the world together for the rest of our lives. Ian Lamont Jordan, will you marry me?”  Brown’s son Jason then made a speech. (Brown learned of Jason’s existence when he received papers from his high school girlfriend demanding overdue child support. At the time, Jason was 10. The reality star adopted Jason in 2007 and then adopted his half-brother in 2010.)  Queer Eye’s Fab Five — Bobby Berk, Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness and Tan France — were all there to celebrate with their costar. France captured the proposal on camera and shared it on Instagram Stories, writing: “I couldn’t be happier for you, KK and Ian!”  That night, the Real World: Philadelphia alum shared a prom-style portrait of himself with his director beau on Instagram.  “I love you because of your heart, your humor, but mostly because you don’t mind serving #GlamourShots realness w/ me anytime I ask,” wrote Brown. “I pray today and this year brings you everything your heart desires.”  Meanwhile, Us Weekly exclusively reported on Wednesday Queer Eye fan favorite Tom Jackson recently remarried his ex-wife! The couple eloped in a private ceremony in Tennessee on March 27.  The newlyweds told Us: “The best part of the day was during the ceremony as we stood before the minister, both of us excited and happy to be recommitting ourselves to each other in marriage.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!	0
"The truest sign Brangelina is legitimately, absolutely over has just come out: both Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are quietly dating other people. And Jolie has been consistently seeing one particular non-famous, handsome real estate agent, according to Entertainment Tonight. ""It's not serious,"" the outlet's source cautioned off the bat. ""Brad and Angie are both very secretive about their dating life. Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent. He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Apparently Jolie is super psyched to just have an adult around. ""Angie was in a very bad place after [her] split [from Brad],"" the source said. ""Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful.""  The source also stressed that a Brangelina reconciliation is most certainly never ever happening, sorry. ""People talk about them reuniting, but it will never happen,"" the source said. ""Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they've attempted therapy with the [six] children [they share], they can barely be in the same room together.""  Pitt, meanwhile, is also dating, also secretly. ""He's very private about who he’s seeing, but he does continue to casually date. The women he sees are not in the public eye,"" a second source told the outlet."	1
"Jesse Camp, best known as a VJ on MTV in the late 1990s, has been reported missing by his sister, Marisha Camp, after she stopped hearing from him over a week ago. Marisha posted on her Instagram Story that if anyone sees him, to ""please let him know that many, many people care.""  The Riverside Police Department told ET on Monday that Marisha ""filed a report with our department last week on the 19th stating he was missing,"" and through friends, she spoke with someone who claimed that her brother was last seen in Riverside, California, though it hasn't been confirmed that he was actually there. Police say that he was last seen in Fontana, California, on Thursday morning.  Marisha posted a number of videos of Jesse, whose real name is Josiah, and wrote, ""If anyone has seen or heard from my brother Jesse since Saturday, please, please, please reach out to me or ask him to call home!!!"" She said she's thankful to people ""who reached out to express their concern and support after my brother Jesse went MIA.""  According to police, Jesse's sister reported that she last spoke with her brother ""around the 11th or the 12th"" of July, which she said was ""unusual."" Police also told ET that Marisha said Jesse ""may have been depressed lately.""  ""Right now we do not see anything dealing with foul play,"" a police spokesperson added to ET. ""We don't have any suspicion or reason to believe that he's in any danger.""  The Riverside Police posted to their Facebook page and asked for information about Jesse, but also said that ""there does not appear to be anything suspicious at this time.""  A Fontana Police Department spokesperson explained to ET on Monday that an officer stopped Jesse outside a Sherwin Williams paint store in Fontana for a ""pedestrian check"" on July 19 at 10:20 a.m., before his sister filed the missing persons report. A bike patrol officer verified Jesse's ID and left after confirming that Jesse was OK, ET reports. It's not known why the officer conducted the check.  In May, Fontana Police booked and released the former MTV VJ for alleged possession of methamphetamine, but there was no additional information available.  Jesse won MTV's first ""Wanna Be a VJ"" in 1998. He became famous for his shaggy hair and irreverence. Later, he had a stint as a rocker with a 1998 album called ""Jesse & the 8th Street Kidz."" He has mostly been out of the spotlight in recent years, but appeared on a Funny Or Die program called ""Triumph's Election Special"" in 2016."	0
Celeb-beloved Body By Simone founder Simone De La Rue and nutritionist-to-the-stars Kelly LeVeque collaborated on BBS, using artificial intelligence to customize fitness and nutrition programs for users.  Leave it to two A-list wellness gurus to democratize customized fitness and nutrition programs for the world. The dream team of Body By Simone personal trainer Simone De La Rue and nutritionist Kelly LeVeque — whose client list includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Emmy Rossum, Jessica Alba and Molly Sims — have just released an app that gives users access to their expertise for a very nominal monthly fee.  But it’s not just an app stuffed with content — more than 900 minutes of video and hundreds of recipes — that leaves users to their own devices to navigate and motivate. For $19.99/month, the platform actually uses artificial intelligence software to create customized workout plans and nutrition programs for each individual, taking into consideration their specific goals. It tracks progress via measurements and weekly photos, and reminds users via push notifications to work out. “It is programmed to provide the customization of a personal workout with me,” says De La Rue, adding, “This has never been done before in a fitness app.”  But while it may seem the app approach speaks only to the general population, De La Rue says hers and LeVeque’s celebrity clients are “very excited, especially as they are often on set or traveling. They can have their dream team in their pocket.” The impetus for the app was a desire to have a platform available to anyone in the world, since the Aussie trainer on E’s Revenge Body can’t be everywhere at once. For a more 360-degree approach, she wanted to include a nutritionist, and because of their several shared clients (Garner and Rossum among them) and complementary beliefs and philosophies, LeVeque was the ideal fit.  When it comes to nutrition, protein and plants are at the core. Recipes run the gamut and might include Jen Garner’s Chocolate Blueberry #fab4smoothie, with collagen, almond butter, spinach, flax and other nutritious ingredients. Says LeVeque of their approach: “Protein ups collagen, muscle tone and metabolism. Fat benefits hormones, skin and cellular health and does not store as fat as simple carbs do. Fiber for gut microbiome proliferation and detoxification, and greens or veggies deep in color to fight inflammation.” These “fab four” foods are at the core of her recipes.  The workouts mix up methodology to keep things interesting, and never use props so they can be done literally anywhere. De La Rue’s favorite currently: dance cardio. “It’s an incredible workout, burns calories, teaches you coordination, challenges your brain to learn choreography and it’s fun and joyous,” she says. The pair’s one-stop-shop app also doles out motivational words and advice, since that’s key to many people’s success with a new wellness plan.  LeVeque suggests users get up and exercise first thing in the morning, since a fasted workout has the same benefits as intermittent fasting, which causes a surge in human growth hormone and testosterone to help burn fat. Additionally, she advocates for early dinners, before dark — which seems decidedly un-Hollywood but has very Hollywood ramifications. “An early dinner allows for the body to digest the meal, balance blood sugar and clear excess insulin before you head to bed,” says LeVeque, “so you can benefit from a fat-burning, belt-shrinking night of sleep!” We see why Garner and Rossum swear by these ladies.	1
"There were plenty of Heavenly Bodies at last night's Met Gala, but there was no divine intervention quite like Nicki Minaj and Cardi B joining forces and hanging out inside the event.  After months and months of feud rumors and alleged shade, the female rappers shared a moment (and even snapped a few selfies) at last night's fashion event.

The collective internet seems to have already passed judgment on Katy Perry’s new track, “Swish Swish,” which is raising eyebrows over its possible lyrical shots at Taylor Swift. Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about “anyone we know.” While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of “Swish Swish” is “liberation” from bullies.  “I think it’s a great anthem for people to use whenever someone’s trying to hold you down or bully you,” she said. “That’s kind of what this record is about, it’s just like [a] 360-degree liberation.” If “Chained to the Rhythm” was about “political liberation” and “Bon Appétit” was a “sexual liberation,” then Perry calls “Swish Swish” “the liberation from all the negative that doesn’t serve you.”  Perry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. “Here’s some of the tea and a biscuit,” she tweeted.  Morning! Here's some of the tea and a biscuit ☕️https://t.co/7I50PYq66Z — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 20, 2017  Since “Swish Swish” dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. “I’ve always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That’s not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],” Rose wrote in a series of tweets.  RELATED: Celebrity Feuds: A look at famous Hollywood fights  Perry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift’s 1989 hit “Bad Blood” has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was “not my question to answer — if it’s about me.”  She further explained, “I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that’s calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can’t mistake kindness for weakness and don’t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that’s not to any one person and don’t quote me that it is, because it’s not. It’s not about that.”  Watch her latest explanation of “Swish Swish” on The Tonight Show above.	0

"If you're at all familiar with the supermodel-heavy, glitter-coated televised spectacular that is the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show , you've heard of the Fantasy Bra: a one-of-a-kind undergarment handmade in collaboration with a jeweler to the exact measurements of one of the Angels that closes out the program (and is valued at a few million dollars). This year the honor of walking the sparkly runway in the very expensive bejeweled creation will go to Lais Ribeiro , the 27-year-old Brazilian model who got her Angel wings in 2015, but has been in the Victoria's Secret family since 2010. And though they're usually made aware of the appointment months before the show, Ribeiro admits that Victoria's Secret cut it a little close this year: She didn't find out until her fitting, which took place in August. (The show tapes in Shanghai on November 21.) So how did the lingerie giant pull off the surprise?  ""[Victoria's Secret] sent the new collection to me—I tried [the bra], and I had to take pictures and polaroids,"" Ribeiro explains to Glamour. ""They said, ‘Oh no, it’s just for a segment on the show.’ I was like, 'Sure!'"" Imagine her surprise when she's trying on looks for the show, and someone wheels in the Fantasy Bra for her to see. Luckily, we don't have to get too creative with the details, because Victoria's Secret got it all on tape.  ""It was a mix of emotions inside of me,"" the model says of what was going through her head when she realized what was going on. ""I was so happy, thankful, honored to be chosen. Hard work pays off—that’s all I thought about. Like, wow, I’ve been working with the brand for seven years, but we never know."" As soon as she wrapped filming for the televised program (you already have a calendar alert set up for the 28th, when it airs on CBS, right?), Ribeiro got into the car to share the news with her family back in Brazil. Over FaceTime, she says, ""I put everybody in the room and I was like, ‘I have something to tell you guys’—they thought I was pregnant, but I was like, ‘No…’ and then they started to scream and cry. My sister dropped the phone.”  Though she notes that her family was number one on the list of people she wanted to share the news with, she was just as psyched to show her fellow Angels. Adriana Lima was a particularly emotional one, because she's acted as a sort of role model for Ribeiro within Victoria's Secret. ""I remember that I was just crying so much [at the fitting], and we [went] back to the room to change, and Adriana was [there]—she said, ‘Hey,’ and saw [the Fantasy Bra] and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, so well-deserved.’"" For people who look up to the Angels, ""Adriana Lima is, like, the strongest because she’s a mother, she’s a sexy girl, she has such a strong personality—but at the same time, she’s so open to teach us and welcome us to where she’s been living for so long,"" Ribeiro says. ""That’s what’s amazing about her.""  Pinterest PHOTO: Gary Gershoff  Ribeiro has said how, growing up Brazil, she didn't know much about the modeling world or Victoria's Secret—however, she vividly remembers the first time she learned about the Fantasy Bra: when fellow Brazilian Gisele Bündchen wore the $12.5 million ""Sexy Splendor Fantasy Bra"" in 2005. ""She’s just killing it; it’s so amazing,"" she recalls. ""And she’s from Brazil. I was just like, 'It’s so amazing to be from a country where we have so many top models and we are proud of what we do.' When you’re from the same country, you’re cheering for [each other]. That was my first and favorite—until now.”  When she hits the catwalk in Shanghai, all Ribeiro hopes for is that the image of her in the ""Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra"" feels true to her. “I hope I can show my personality…. I try to be calm and do me,"" she says. That's not as easy as it sounds when you're on that mega-runway in your lingerie, with heavy wings flapping behind you, Ribeiro assures: ""You’re walking and you feel like you’re bouncing""—but at the same time you're trying to have that not read on your face because you know you have cameras pointed at you from every angle. Looking for familiar faces in the audience doesn't help calm her nerves, either. ""When I [see] them, I just want to cry. It’s kind of like, ‘OK, they’re there, they’re proud of me, but I can’t control my emotions,’ because I’m very emotional,"" she admits. When the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show went to London, she actually couldn't keep it together: ""I saw my sister, and I just started to cry and everyone was like, ‘What is happening?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know!’""  Loading View on Instagram  The ""Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra"" will have its moment to shine on the 2017 Victoria's Secret runway later this month, but Ribeiro has gotten a few chances to try the style on for size since she got the news. So the million-dollar—or rather, two-million-dollar question is: What does the Fantasy Bra feel like? According to Ribeiro, ""It feels amazing, I have to say—it feels very powerful. I was just feeling myself when I was wearing it.""  Related Stories:  And the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Fantasy Bra Goes To…  The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Finally Cast Its Models!

Despite all the bad blood that’s gone before, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are now firmly friends once again. In fact, R-Patz even sent K-Stew some flowers to congratulate her on her upcoming ‘SNL’ performance! Read on for details.  Looks like Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are finally back in a good place once again. As K-Stew prepares to make her big SNL hosting appearance tonight, R-Patz is showing his support for his ex-girlfriend, in a super sweet way. And when it comes to her possibly name checking the Brit during the show, he’s totally not phased!  “Rob isn’t worried about Kristen’s SNL performance,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He knows that if she does make reference to him it will be in a light-hearted way, and there won’t be any malice involved. They’re in a pretty good place these days and talk quite often. Rob even sent Kristen a bunch of flowers with a really sweet supportive note, telling her to ‘break a leg’, he’s super excited for her and how well her career is going right now.”  Meanwhile, as HollywoodLife.com previously reported, K-Stew is terrified she will mess up on the big night, but vows to just roll with it if things go wrong. “For six years I’ve been being a total wuss about it. At some point you have to just bite the bullet, you know, and just fail,” she admitted during a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon. On a lighter note she said “it’s been really really fun” rehearsing for the show, so at least she’s having a total blast getting ready for the big night.  The starlet was asked by E! News back in 2010 why she hadn’t hosted the show, as she was at the height of her Twilight popularity back then. She said she hadn’t been asked and that, “I would love to say yes for sure, but that is really, really scary. I am so critical of myself and then also of people who are on the show. It’s like, ‘Nope, you’re not funny — next!’” It may have taken all these years, but she’s finally up for the challenge and we can’t wait to watch!  HollywoodLifers, will you be tuning in to watch Kristen Stewart hosting SNL tonight? Let us know in the comments!	1

"MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  In this week’s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is ‘eating him away.’Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms."	1

Scheana Shay doesn’t even have to watch Vanderpump Rules to know how her relationship with now ex-boyfriend Rob Valletta has come off to fans.  “I will admit, I haven’t watched the last few episodes … last season, watching my divorce wasn’t as hard for me because I was in a very happy relationship, and I was madly in love with Rob,” Shay told costar and BFF Ariana Madix on the Tuesday, March 6, episode of her podcast, Scheananigans.  “Wait, you were?” Madix said sarcastically.  “I kept it super low-key,” Shay joked.  As previously reported, the SUR waitress filed for divorce from her husband of over two years, Mike Shay, in November 2016. She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay “pathetic” and “cringeworthy” on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.  “Now I’m single, I’ve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,” Shay explained. “Obviously, you can’t see every minute of every conversation … I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one … You can’t fault me for being happy and being in love.”  “Rob was very reserved on the show,” she continued. “He is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person … So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.”  Valletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: “No one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic. Leaving mean or nasty comments needs to stop!”  Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Rejoice, Julia Roberts is finally on Instagram!  The Oscar-winning actress, 50, shared her first social media post on Tuesday in which she showed off her iconic smile while wearing a black sweatshirt reading “Love.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Hello☀,” Roberts wrote in the caption.  While this is the mother of three’s first time sharing a social media post of her own, it’s far from the first time she’s been featured on other celebrity Instagrams.  Roberts made an appearance of plenty of Instagram pages last month after attending Taylor Swift’s show at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.  Rebel Wilson, Amber Rose and Entertainment Tonight host Carly Steel all took selfies with the actress.  Roberts’ Instagram account is surprising as she told Marie Claire in 2013 that she thought social media as an “appealing” yet “sticky” cotton candy.  “[Social media is] kind of like cotton candy: It looks so appealing and you just can’t resist getting in there, and then you just end up with sticky fingers and it lasted an instant,” she said.  “There’s an anonymity that makes people feel safe to participate in hatefulness,” Roberts continued. “I like a good old-fashioned fistfight if people are pissed off at each other. I just feel like if you’re really mad and want to have a fight, then put your dukes up.”	0
The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.You might be wondering:Why some of the doctors don’t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!It’s time for Congress to rescind the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.It’s about time vaccines are publicly acknowledged by the feds and the media for all the health damages they have caused. Just check out the CDC’s VAERS reports and the vaccine damage payouts by the HHS/HRSA. According to a new report published on March 1, 2017, by the department of health and human services of the United States, about $ 3,363,282,409.21 have been paid for vaccine adverse reactions and deaths from 1989 to 2017 so far.Тhis is a very controversial topic today.

DeMario Jackson and Corinne Olympios in Octobe Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock  In October, Jackson opened up about his friendship with Olympios.  “In the media — the media wanted black versus white. They wanted angry black guy, they wanted this little white girl. But in reality, both of us were put against each other,” he said at the time.  “It was one of those things that people want us not to be friends. They want to paint a particular narrative. Even now the narrative is they’re friends now,” he explained. “It’s like, ‘Oh, it’s fake.’ It’s always you’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t.”	0
President Donald Trump and the Republicans in Washington D.C. are preparing to carry out their most heartless plan ever.As winter weather begins to set in across the United States, federal politicians are reportedly making huge cuts to a crucial government program that provides heating assistance to the elderly and disabled. Under the GOP proposal, millions of American households will be at risk of losing heat this winter, as reported by the Independent.co.ukSadly, this is exactly what millions of Americans have been fearing. The Republicans are carrying out a major attack against poor people and senior citizens, all so they can give a few more tax cuts to their rich friends.As Gray TV reported recently, “President Donald Trump proposed cutting the multi-billion-dollar program as part of his budget plan. Government estimates suggest six million people rely on it to heat, cool, or weatherize their homes.”This is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s utter disregard for everyday people in our country. Time and time again, Trump has taken every opportunity he has to make life harder for the people in the bottom 50 percent of America.The Republicans have spent years trying to destroy everything that makes America great. Now that they have control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency, they are ramping up their ruthless campaign to full speed.It’s time for Americans to wake up and stand up to the stupid Republican politicians in Washington D.C. – enough is enoughPlease ‘SHARE,’ to help us get the word out.RelatedCommentscomments	1
"Khloe Kardashian had a lot of help from her own mom when it came to decorating her baby's nursery.  Khloe confirmed her pregnancy via a baby bump photo on Instagram in December and revealed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this year that she and Tristan Thompson are expecting a baby girl. E! News learned on Thursday she gave birth to their daughter. The news comes amid an alleged cheating scandal involving Tristan. The two have not commented.  Khloe's mother Kris Jenner has helped her a lot with her nursery, flying to Cleveland to lend a hand in person and also shipping decor and other baby products to the house, E! News has learned.  In early March, the two spent two hours shopping for baby gear, toys, furniture and clothes at Petit Tresor and Couture Kids in Los Angeles. Khloe picked out items in pink and neutral colors. Kris made many suggestions and Khloe agreed with many of them, a source told E! News. Kris paid for everything and was happy to treat Khloe, who thanked her several times, the source said.  ""Kris and Khloe were having a blast inside Petit Tresor together,"" another insider told E! News at the time. ""They were both laughing and having fun picking out all of the different baby items. Kris knew exactly what Khloe needed and was helping make a lot of the decisions. The majority of the store is filled with girl items and most items are neutral or pink colored. There are not many boy options, so they had a lot to choose from for her little girl.""  ""They bought a hefty amount and had a lot delivered to a house in Calabasas,"" the insider said. ""Khloe also registered several items on a registry and sent it out to her guests for her shower. The registry is already almost completely sold out. It's been nuts.""  ""Been decorating the baby nursery all day! We are so close!"" Khloe tweeted on March 14. ""I'm getting more and more anxious and excited with everyday."""	1
"Over 2,665 days ago, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were spotted—arm in arm—at a Philadelphia IHOP. And so began the long, complicated, and endless saga of “Jelena,” which, in its latest of many twists, has the on-again, off-again couple once again hitting the “off“ switch.  How did we get here, exactly? You’re forgiven for not knowing. After all, IHOP was centuries ago, or at least 2010, when Barack Obama was a first-term president and America watched American Idol and Survivor. Here’s a comprehensive guide to their on-and-off, up-and-down, are-they-or-aren’t-they relationship.  December 2010—The Infamous IHOP Date  TMZ breaks the news that the teen idols enjoyed a “cuddly” date at an IHOP in Philadelphia ahead of a Q102’s Jingle Ball. Gomez tells Us Weekly that it was platonic, and that Bieber is “one of my best friends . . . It was just pancakes!”  Bieber, too, stays mum on the subject, telling MTV that she’s “an amazing person,” but, “I think that people are always gonna be interested in my personal life . . . but I gotta keep some things to myself. I’m just having fun being a teenager.”  January 2011—The New Year’s Weekend Kiss  With dating rumors swirling, paparazzi pictures catch the then 16- and 18-year-olds kissing on a yacht in St. Lucia, essentially proving what fans already suspected—they’re an item.  February 2011—The Big Debut  At the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, the teen-dream couple made their red carpet debut together, thereby confirming their relationship. They even take some lovey-dovey pictures in the photo booth.  May 2011—Young and (Visibly) in Love  After a glamorous appearance at the Billboard Music Awards, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez jet off to Maui, Hawaii. Photographers catch them canoodling in the ocean–Gomez noticeably rocking some statement hoops—and the photos go viral.  September 2011—The Staples Center Date  Here we reach peak Jelena—reports surface that Bieber rented the entire Staples Center arena so he and his lady love could watch Titanic, alone. “Romance isn’t dead,” Bieber tweeted. “Treat your lady right fellas.”  November 2011—Baby Mama Drama  A storm brews in paradise as a woman accuses Bieber of fathering her child. After a paternity test, the case is thrown out.  December 2011–October 2012—All Is . . . Well?  For the next 10 months, all seems content on the Jelena front. They’re spotted at a Lakers game, on a helicopter ride, at the Teen Choice Awards, and celebrating her birthday. But some tabloid sites start alleging that the two may not be as solid as people think.  November 2012—The First Split  Bieber and Gomez break up for the first time. Conflicting schedules, trust issues, and their young ages are all rumored to be causes of the demise.  April 2013—Hidden Lyrics?  Although the two aren’t together, and despite the fact that Gomez tells Ryan Seacrest “it’s not really about a specific person,” fans theorize that her new song “Come & Get It,” with lyrics like “Can’t stop because I love it, hate the way I love you / All day all night, maybe I’m addicted for life, no lie,” is about Bieber.  Fuel is added to the fire when Bieber allegedly posts—and then quickly deletes—an Instagram with Gomez.  But at the end of 2013, Bieber admits the two aren’t speaking, although he still loves her.  2014—Are They or Aren’t They?  2014, to put it lightly, was a confusing year in the Jelena timeline. First of all, it’s the year that Bieber’s image goes full-on bad boy—after bizarre incidents in 2013, like peeing in a bucket and losing custody of his monkey—he gets in real, tangible trouble. In January alone, he’s arrested for drunk driving, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license, and he was also accused of vandalism for egging his neighbors. (January isn’t great for Gomez, either, who checks into rehab.) The tabloids viciously suggest it’s because of Bieber and/or a drug problem, but a frustrated Gomez later tells GQ that it was to seek help for lupus.  But before the rehab and before the DUI, the couple is spotted riding Segways in Calabasas, California. Throughout the year, and all the drama, the “maybe dates” continue: a Starbucks run in Texas and a day at the zoo. Then, the Instagram—Bieber posts (and also deletes) a bunch of pictures of his former beau, including one that calls their love “unconditional.”  But concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones . . . with Bieber and other women. He’s associated with a slew of models, up-and-coming actresses, and other beauties—including Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who Gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on Instagram, and she also unfollowed Bieber.  Then there’s the international incident in July 2014, when Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber get into fist fight, allegedly over Gomez.  In November, Gomez releases “The Heart Wants What It Wants,” which she suggests is about Bieber. She gives an emotional performance of the song at the American Music Awards, which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course. That same month, Bieber unfollows her on Instagram. In December, he posts a picture of himself with Hailey Baldwin, but in the caption says he’s “super single.”  2015—Are They or Aren’t They? (Part Two)  We’re entering the second of the lost Jelena years, where no one knows quite what’s going on, perhaps not even the Bieber and Gomez themselves.  After being spotted holding hands at a Golden Globes party, Gomez and Zedd enjoy a brief romance. Zedd admits two years later to Billboard that he wasn’t ready to date an international superstar like Gomez: “Reporters were calling my parents. People were hacking my friends’ phones. I was pissed. [Though] I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,” he said.  Bieber continues to post throwback pictures of Gomez on Instagram, confusing just about everyone—including Drake. Reconciliation rumors ramp up after he tells Ellen DeGeneres that a number of songs on his new album Purpose are about Gomez, and a video surfaces of Bieber serenading her with “My Girl” at a hotel in Beverly Hills.  But Gomez makes it clear she’s sick of being defined by their relationship. In her cover story with Elle, she says her November 2014 AMA performance was her personal life swan song. “Everybody was talking about the same thing: my relationship,” she remembers. “I was so exhausted. I said, ‘I want this [performance] to be the last time I have to talk about this. And acknowledge this feeling.’ ”  Early 2016—Here We Go Again  In January 2016, Justin Bieber posts steamy pictures with Hailey Baldwin in St. Barth’s, which many take to mean they are dating. The speculation increases when Baldwin makes a cameo in Bieber’s GQ cover story. He describes her as “someone I really love. We spend a lot of time together.”  However, Baldwin later tells Marie Claire that they weren’t ever official. “We are not an exclusive couple. He’s about to go on tour,” she said. “Relationships at this age are already complicated, but I don’t really like to talk about it because it’s between me and him.”  Bieber posts a throwback picture of him and Gomez kissing, and she comments “perfect.”  August 2016—Full-Out War  Although claiming they’re just friends, Bieber posts a series of Instagrams with Sofia Richie. However, after backlash from fans, Bieber posted “I’m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don’t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn’t be so mean to people that I like.”  Gomez responded in the comments section: “If you can’t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol—it should be special between you two only. Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you.”  That, allegedly, kicked off a full-on Instagram war between the couple, involving many comments, including cheating accusations on both sides, which are now said to be deleted. Gomez later takes to her Snapchat to say that what she did was “selfish and pointless.” Bieber deletes his Instagram.  A few months later, it's reported that Gomez cut her Revival Tour short to seek treatment at a facility in Tennessee. “My self-esteem was shot. I was depressed, anxious. I started to have panic attacks right before getting onstage, or right after leaving the stage. Basically I felt I wasn’t good enough, wasn’t capable,” she later told Vogue.  January 2017—New Beginnings  Gomez begins to date The Weeknd.  May 2017—Fashionable Debuts  Gomez and The Weeknd hit the red carpet couple together at the 2017 Met Gala.  September 2017—Health Scares  Gomez reveals on Instagram that she underwent a kidney transplant. (The donor was her friend Francia Raisa.)  October 2017—Reunited Again  Bieber and Gomez are seen hanging out together again, but multiple sources say it’s just as friends. Allegedly, their church, Hillsong, as well as Gomez’s kidney transplant caused to two to reconnect. And The Weeknd was reportedly fine with it.  However, just about a week after the reports, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd announce their split (although, apparently, Bieber was not the cause).  November 2017—Conscious Re-Coupling  In the weeks following Gomez’s breakup with The Weeknd, she's spotted canoodling with Bieber. . . again and again and again. On November 15, they kiss at his hockey game—fueling tabloid speculation that they are back together and better than ever. A few weeks later, they're seen at the Beverly Hills Montage.  January 2018—Yep, This is a ThingAlthough there is no official statement that they are back on, a flurry of sightings (including a New Year's trip to Los Cabos and joint-gym workout) confirm the inevitable: Jelena is definitely a thing.  February 2018—Going StrongFirst, there's a Valentine’s Day date at the Montage Beverly Hills (is this their spot? It's totally their spot). Then, the duo jet off to Jamaica for Bieber's fathers wedding, providing a much-needed distraction to an otherwise terrible news cycle.  March 2018—Instagram Official  Gomez wishes Bieber a happy birthday on Instagram: ""March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom,"" she writes. March 1 is (yes, you guessed it) the day the Sorry singer was born.  Yet, days later, reports surface that the two are pressing pause on their relationship. But is it a break. . . or a break up?  Perhaps a People anonymous source put it best: “They’ve been having disagreements, but it wouldn’t be surprising if they’re back together in a week.”  Watch Selena Gomez on Family, Obsessions, and Her Go-To Dance Moves:"	1
Singer Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016, in Burbank, California. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia Singer Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016, in Burbank, California. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia  The Voice will soon be back for another season. This time around Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani are the show’s coaches. Gwen’s return as a coach should be interesting now that she and Blake are further into their relationship. There are reports that this has had an effect on their contracts with The Voice and what the couple is planning next for their relationship.  Curious about what’s going on between them? Here are 10 things we know about their relationship.  1. They have recently released music about their divorces  Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images  Gwen and Blake were both recently divorced when they got together. Blake got a divorce from Miranda Lambert. And his new album, If I’m Honest, purposely starts off with a party song and then goes into sadder music, a transition that reflects his personal life. “That’s when it became painfully obvious that it wasn’t going to work out in my ­marriage,” he told Billboard. Although the singer has made a new album about the end of the relationship, there is still mystery surrounding what caused the divorce.  Gwen had a messy divorce from Gavin Rossdale after she reportedly found out he cheated. She came out with a new album that includes a single titled, “Used To Love You.”  “It was really a life-saver record for me,” she told Time. “It wasn’t until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, ‘God gave me a gift. I’m going to use it now. Because if I don’t, I’m going to die.'”  2. Blake’s divorce announcement on The Voice brought them closer  Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  When the two started working together they had no clue they were both going through the same thing. Then, Blake decided to announce his divorce.  “We were all mic-ed up and everything, and Blake’s like, ‘I gotta talk to you guys.’ And he basically made his announcement,” Gwen told Howard Stern. “He basically told me what was going on with him. We just started this friendship. I wasn’t trying to start a relationship. I was just trying to not die. There was no plan. It was an incredible gift to be able to have a friend.”  3. Gwen had no clue who Blake was before going on the show  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC  This is probably the case for many fans of The Voice who aren’t country music lovers. But it’s a little more surprising for someone in the industry to admit. Gwen revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, “I didn’t even know that Blake Shelton existed in the world! I had no idea.” She also had no clue what he sounded like.  He sent me this song in an email, and I was so scared because at that point I really didn’t know even what his voice really sounded like. Like, I’d heard it on the show, but I wasn’t paying attention. I was like, ‘Whatever, country guy’s on. When’s Pharrell coming on?’  4. They didn’t confirm they were dating until November 2015  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  In the beginning, there were rumors the two were dating, but they still kept it secret. Still, it was badly kept because there were photos of them getting cozy together at a Halloween party. Finally, in November, Blake’s rep confirmed they were dating to E! News.    5. Gwen and Blake are actually working like a team this season  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  It seemed unclear whether the couple’s romantic relationship would make them more competitive with each other or whether they would work together. It looks like the latter will be happening.  “We’ll be driving home at night, and I’ll be like, ‘Do you think I should put these two people against each other?’ and he’ll be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,'” Gwen revealed to ET. “I was like, ‘I don’t believe you! I think you’re trying to trick me right now!'”  6. They’re reportedly being paid more because of their relationship  Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC  It’s possible The Voice might see a ratings boost from fans hoping to get a look into the couple’s relationship on the show. Because of this, they are reportedly getting paid more.  “[Blake and Gwen] are getting paid an exceptional bonus that is significantly higher than the other judges to keep the spark alive on-camera,” a production source told Radar Online. “The producers really want to see Gwen and Blake in competition more often this upcoming season, versus working with each other like they have in the past.”  7. But they do have a breakup clause in their contracts  Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC  Of course there is a risk this plan could backfire. Instead of the couple being cute on screen, they could end up breaking up and might not want to work with each other. Well, the producers have a safety net in place in case of a break-up.  “And, of course, there is a stipulation in their contract, which is more of a break-up clause,” the production source told Radar Online. “If, for some reason, they call it quits, they are both required to finish out the remainder of their existing contracts.”  8. They have reportedly already finalized their wedding plans  Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images  This couple is all in when it comes to their relationship. They reportedly have already made their wedding arrangements. “They’ve met with vendors,” a source told Us Weekly in 2016. The source also claimed they want to get married “before the end of the year.” So even though we didn’t see a 2016 wedding, one might be on the horizon.    9. It will reportedly be a $3 million Beverly Hills wedding  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People’s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People’s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images  There have been reports the couple decided to get married in Beverly Hills on May 5, 2017. According to OK! Magazine, they sent out invitations that said the ceremony would be at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Other stars, including Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland, have gotten hitched there previously.  10. They are putting the wedding on hold (for now)  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani during the NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium | Christian Petersen/Getty Images Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani during the NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium | Christian Petersen/Getty Images  The celebrity couple has reportedly been making big plans for their wedding in hopes to tie the knot this year. However, it looks like those plans are on hold. According to Life & Style, they want to do one more thing first.  “They’re trying to have a baby first,” a source close to Gwen revealed. “That’s their main focus right now. She’s determined to have another baby and carry it herself, even though Blake has said it doesn’t matter if they adopt or get a surrogate.” This actually might be a challenging endeavor considering Gwen had her three kids through vitro treatments. “Physically and emotionally, it was just a lot for her,” continued the source. “So she’s trying to get pregnant naturally for the time being.”  Follow Nicole Weaver on Twitter @nikkibernice  Check out Entertainment Cheat Sheet on Facebook!	1

She's been a model for two years with work for makeup mogul Pat McGrath, Too Faced cosmetics and South Beach already under her belt.  But there's one side of her that up-and-coming fashion star Gracie Phillips has always kept hidden: her family background.  Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the 20-year-old LA-based catwalk sensation has spoken for the first time about her actor father Lou Diamond Phillips, 56.  Phillips, whose film and TV credits include La Bamba, Young Guns, Miami Vice and The 33, has three more daughters: Gracie's twin Isabella, Lilli, 18, and Indigo, 11.  But while he admits to chatting about Gracie's achievements 'with anyone who asks', his 20-year-old daughter, whose mother is former Penthouse model Kelly Phillips, has long been more hesitant.  Model Gracie Phillips, 20, exclusively revealed to DailyMail.com that her father is La Bamba actor Lou Diamond Phillips. The LA-based model said she kept her father a secret because she wanted to make it on her own  Gracie said: 'When I started, I never wanted anyone to say to me, she did this job because of her dad, because of her last name, because of who she is'  The brunette model said she kept her father a secret because she didn't want to face the same negative Kendall Jenner, Bella and Gigi Hadid faced due to their celebrity background  Phillips said: 'I'm incredibly proud of Grace and the fact that she wanted to earn this, she wanted to make her own way - I was supportive of that from the beginning.' Pictured: The father and daughter in December 1999  'When I started, I really just wanted to try and do it by myself and say yes, I did it all by myself,' Gracie explained.  'At the time, it was kind of in the height of Hollywood royalty where everyone was kind of doing things and you'd find out this is the child of so-and-so.  'As I was looking on social media, I saw positives but I also saw the negatives – people bashing the kids of people who were in the industry, saying they're only doing this because of this.  'When I started, I never wanted anyone to say to me, she did this job because of her dad, because of her last name, because of who she is.'  Phillips added: 'I'm incredibly proud of Grace and the fact that she wanted to earn this, she wanted to make her own way - I was supportive of that from the beginning.  'She's been booking jobs, she's been receiving praise and getting incredibly good feedback based on her own merit, without getting any qualifications.  'It's not that I don't want her to say she's my progeny but at the same time, there's no doubt it's very, very rewarding and I'm very, very pleased that she can take all the credit for this herself as she should.  'She's the one who's built her own boat in this respect.'  Like her contemporaries Kaia Gerber, Brooklyn Beckham and Gigi Hadid, Grace's childhood was one of film sets, travel and paparazzi eager to snatch a photo of her famous parents.  Gracie explained: 'When I started, I really just wanted to try and do it by myself. At the time, it was kind of in the height of Hollywood royalty where everyone was kind of doing things and you'd find out this is the child of so-and-so.' Pictured: Gracie with her sisters Isabella and Lilli and Phillips in an undated photo  She continued: 'As I was looking on social media, I saw positives but I also saw the negatives – people bashing the kids of people who were in the industry, saying they're only doing this because of this'. Pictured: The future model in grade school  Phillips, 56, whose film and TV credits include La Bamba, Young Guns, Miami Vice and The 33, admits to chatting about Gracie's achievements 'with anyone who asks. Pictured: Phillips and his ex-wife and Gracie's mother Kelly, a former Penthouse model  Phillips says he and his former wife Kelly did their best to ensure her young life was 'normal' – 'going shopping and cooking dinner, taking out the trash and picking up dog poop.'  He said: 'It's literally just not putting on airs and pretensions and making sure the kids see you as dad first when you're around.'  But some of Gracie's earliest memories are far from ordinary, among them the time she first saw the film La Bamba and broke down in tears thinking her father had really died, as he does in the movie.  'Growing up, I didn't know any different,' she told DailyMail.com.  'I was always on set, always around paparazzi and fans and it never really fazed me. I was just really proud of my dad.  'I do remember when I first saw La Bamba, I was taken aback – I wasn't born when it came out but I first saw it when I was really young.  'I didn't really understand the concept of acting yet, so when I first saw it, I actually thought he died.'  Phillips added: 'I remember it very well, she came outside with tears in her eyes and went, Dad, you've died! And I was like no, I'm right here!'  'I was really upset,' Gracie recalled. 'But after that, I was able to understand, oh this is not real and I understood that it was acting.'  Gracie says modeling is where she expresses herself best – and says hopes to follow in the Hadid sisters' footsteps and take to the catwalk as a Victoria's Secret Angel one day  Phillips thinks his daughter is smart enough to navigate industry pitfalls such as wild parties, predatory men and rejection and come through unscathed.Pictured: The actor with Gracie (center) with her sisters in 2004  She also joined her father in front of the camera early on, starring in a Hallmark film directed by the 56-year-old in which she played a cholera victim – an 'odd, odd experience' according to Phillips.  But despite her acting pedigree and desire to try it again one day, Gracie says modeling is where she expresses herself best – and says hopes to follow in the Hadid sisters' footsteps and take to the catwalk as a Victoria's Secret Angel one day.  'Ever since I was a little girl, when the show comes on, I put on the wings, put on a pair of high heels, a sparkly bra and underwear and pretend,' Gracie said.  'One day, if I'm not watching it from my TV, it'll be because I'm doing it, carrying on my tradition for real – that's my hope, my biggest dream.'  For now, she 'has several jobs booked' but hopes to walk in New York Fashion Week and elsewhere for luxury brands such as Chanel, Versace and Alexander Wang this year.  Standing right behind Gracie is her father, currently busy with pilot season, who says he thinks his daughter is smart enough to navigate industry pitfalls such as wild parties, predatory men and rejection and come through unscathed.  'It's incredibly frightening and not only have I seen [predatory behavior] and I know people like this, if not some of the people involved,' he told DailyMail.com.  'It's out there and the fact that Grace and I have always been able to have candid conversations, not only about this but about drugs and all kinds of other stuff.  'I know she is armed when it comes to dealing with these things.  Gracie once joined her father in front of the camera, starring in a Hallmark film directed by the 56-year-old in which she played a cholera victim – an 'odd, odd experience' according to Phillips. Gracie said she has the desire to try acting again one day  For now, she 'has several jobs booked' but hopes to walk in New York Fashion Week and elsewhere for luxury brands such as Chanel, Versace and Alexander Wang this year  He continued: 'It doesn't mean it's going to be any less painful and any less uncomfortable dealing with these situations but I know this sort of thing is out in the open now – she's going to benefit from that and will not allow herself to be shamed into anything.'  One thing he would like to do is work with Gracie on camera again, and says she could make a career in acting if she chose to.  The Night Stalker star added: 'I think she's slowly claiming her own territory. She's as beautiful as the girl next door but I think she's got this edginess to her.  'It's exciting to think that certain photographers are going to find her and help her establish her own persona out there.'  Gracie, meanwhile, is hoping that people will react positively to the revelation she has a famous father and respect her for trying to make it on her own.  'What I hope is going to happen is obviously I'd like to say I'll get some bigger jobs and bigger things will happen,' she said of opening up about her famous dad.  'That's my hope. But also I feel like it is a positive that I didn't go into it that way at first.  'So I'm hoping the reaction is more, wow she decided to do this on her own before and that's really admirable. I'm hoping it's not something that's taken negatively.'	0

"Bruce Jenner is reportedly upset that American reality television star Kim Kardashian is treating her daughter North West like an ""accessory.""  According to Hollywood Life, the 65-year-old former Olympian is against the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taking the 19-month-old toddler around the world, including in the front row at fashion shows.  ""He wants North to be a kid. To go to kid things,"" an insider said. ""She has no business being at a fashion show and he's appalled that Kim sometimes drags her around like some sort of an accessory.""  ""He doesn't appreciate how every time he turns around he sees his granddaughter's face plastered on magazines and websites. He hates it and doesn't want her to be exploited the way she is,"" the source added.  This comes after North threw tantrums twice during the New York Fashion Week.  The tiny tot burst into tears at father Kanye West's show with Adidas and the toddler also cried at the Alexander Wang runway show.  Meanwhile, it was previously reported that Kardashian feels North should not be banned from attending high profile events just ""because she's a baby""."	1
"Apparently, their first scene together was shot at a swimming pool and from her comments, it seems JLaw wasn’t exactly upset about getting a glimpse of the Aussie actor’s bod:  “I think that was like his first day on set,” she said. “I was like, 'Hiii’”.  She went on to say she loves talking about the scene because it gives her an excuse to “keep bringing up the Speedo”.  “Then I get my memories,” she said.  While Edgerton has been a little less direct with his comments about his costar, he’s also gushed over JLaw in recent interviews:  Speaking with the Herald Sun, he said:  ""Jen's a machine. She's up for anything and (is) game to wrestle with whatever demons she needs to for the sake of the movie.""  Lawrence split with boyfriend Darren Aronofsky last November, but recently said she still loved him during a taping of Marc Maron's podcast:  ""I was in love with him for, like, two years... I still love him very much.""  The Red Sparrow star spoke about the break up with The Mirror, sharing that she’s now in “single mode”:  “I am in the single mode where I am like, ‘Cool, I can do whatever I want and I can be alone and watch terrible TV,’” she said.  She went on to share that she doesn’t expect things to change for her romantically anytime soon, suggesting that she will likely lose the positive attitude fast:  “And then, of course, in a few months I will be devastatingly lonely and feel like I'm on some long waiting list,” she said. “But I am not there yet.”  Unless, of course, she and Edgerton kick off a new, adorable relationship... then she'll hopefully skip that ""devastatingly lonely"" part altogether.

"Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler and reality-TV star Kristin Cavallari are selling their massive estate in Nashville for just under $8 million. The sprawling hilltop home will serve as the backdrop for the couple's upcoming reality-TV show, ""Very Cavallari,"" premiering on E! on July 8.  The superstylish mansion offers seven bedrooms, seven full baths, and three half bathrooms spread across just under 20,000 square feet. Built in 2007, the Mediterranean-style villa sits on 8.5 wooded acres, offering seclusion as well as breathtaking views. The duo purchased the home in 2012 for $5.3 million.  Exterior realtor.com  Family realtor.com  Kitchen  Library realtor.com  Master bed realtor.com  Master bath realtor.com  Wine cellar realtor.com  It's been seven years since Cavallari was reality-TV royalty, thanks to her starring role on ""The Hills."" Now that she is a wife and mother, her new show chronicles all the behind-the-scenes drama of her latest venture, a lifestyle and jewelry brand based in Nashville called Uncommon James.  Across all of its massive 25 rooms, the estate reflects the brand's style—just a little bit rustic, while remaining cool and refined.  The show's trailer features the celeb couple at home in the mansion.  Cutler and Cavallari were married five years ago and have three children. After Cutler was released by the Chicago Bears after eight seasons with the team, the family settled in Nashville. The couple were thrown for a bit of a loop with the sale of their Chicago-area home. Listed for $4.75 million in June 2017, the Illinois home sold in November for $3.6 million.  No word on why Cutler and Cavallari have decided to sell their Nashville digs, but according to the Tennessean, they plan to relocate to another home in the area. Perhaps after being featured on their series, the couple is concerned about security.  “This house has a lot to offer,” Cutler told the Tennessean. “We have a lot of memories in that house, and we will miss it. We got married and had three children since we have owned that house, so it’s been a huge part of our life, and hopefully someone will enjoy it as much as we have.”  With a new home on the horizon, it sounds as if the team at Uncommon James are about to get a whole new project."	0
"[This story contains spoilers from the series finale of A&E's Bates Motel.]  After five seasons, numerous deaths and a dark decent into madness, the world of A&E's Bates Motel came to a close Monday with an expected yet heartbreaking series finale.  In “The Cord,” the death toll continued to rise. Romero (Nestor Carbonell) fulfilled his death wish when he forced ""Norman"" (Freddie Highmore) to show him where he'd left Norma’s (Vera Farmiga) body. Only Norman — who was still ""Mother"" at that point — killed Romero as he was sobbing over Norma's corpse.  But before Romero breathed his last breath, he reminded Norman of his actions — that he was the one responsible for killing his beloved mother. As a result, “Mother” left Norman behind, saying he no longer needed her now that he knew everything. It was enough to send Norman into a lonely tailspin and revert his damaged mind all the way back to the time of the pilot, when he and Norma first traveled to White Pine Bay and opened their infamous motel.  Hoping against hope for everything to revert back to normal, Norman dragged his mother’s body to the motel and into the house and called his brother Dylan (Max Thieriot) to come over for dinner as though nothing had happened. In the end, Dylan knew that he was the only one left standing who cared about Norman’s well-being and opted not to call the authorities. Instead, Dylan attempted to bring Norman in himself.  Unfortunately, the only thing Norman wanted in the end was to be reunited with his mother, even if it meant he had to die. So in a twisted suicide attempt, Norman rushed at a gun-wielding Dylan with a knife, forcing his brother to shoot and kill him.  “Thank you,” Norman muttered as his last words as Dylan held his dying brother.  To break down the series finale and what went into crafting the ultimate ending, The Hollywood Reporter caught up with co-showrunners Cartlon Cuse and Kerry Ehrin.  How much of this was the ending you planned from the start? How much changed over the years?  Ehrin: We’d always thought of this as a love story. A very weird, warped, dark, love story. In the end, it felt like even if we were reuniting them in death that they had to be reunited. Even if it was lying next to each other in earth for all eternity. That was the driving destination emotionally. The Dylan story became part of that, and him being the one that ushers Norman out of the world felt fitting.  Cuse: We came to the idea later that Dylan would be the one to usher Norman out of the world at Norman’s bequest. But from when we first started talking about the show, we imagined a five-year journey that would end with Norman and Norma both dead. Ultimately, we felt their love story could just not succeed in this world.  Are viewers meant to feel as though Norman wanted Dylan to kill him?  Cuse: He’s coming at Dylan with a knife; I mean, Dylan doesn’t have a choice.  Ehrin: He wants to be put out of his misery at that point. When Norman goes over to the sink and picks up the knife, you can see all these ideas playing in his head of what he’s supposed to do now that he’s been told that Norma is dead; she doesn’t exist, and he’s not going to get her back, and there’s no pretending your way out of this. It’s a beautiful performance, because you see all these things play through him. He doesn’t quite know what he’s doing when he picks up the knife and starts walking toward Dylan. He’s working it out as he’s walking.  Cuse: It’s always a bit of a double-edged sword to talk about stuff afterward. It’s fine for people to have their own interpretation of what happened at the end. Most of the audience will have that experience. It wasn’t intentionally ambiguous, but you can draw your own line and make a decision as to what degree Norman is egging him on and to what degree can Dylan stop himself. There was a certain messy, tragic quality to that final encounter that we love.  Ehrin: Messy tragedy has been our hallmark. We like to not over-define things. We like to throw it out there and wade around it.  Were you going for an Of Mice and Men vibe?  Ehrin: Yes. That’s dead on. That was definitely an inspiration in early discussions. The idea of a mercy killing that was also heartbreaking.  Cuse: There’s a poignancy in Norman having a brief moment of clarity that gives him perspective. If you think of the distorted mental state Norman is in when he invites Dylan to come to dinner and has Norma kind of propped up on the table, there was a real poignancy in having Norman realize that all avenues were closed to him. He doesn’t want to go to a mental institution, he can’t exist in this world, he’s in a degrading mental state. There was no other solution for him.  Why didn’t Emma (Olivia Cooke) call the police when she knew Dylan was going into the house?  Ehrin: She actually did in one draft. It was an editing decision in post. Once you get Dylan into that house, you just wanted to stay with him and be with that and not cut away to something else.  Cuse: It’s fair in a situation like this that characters don’t always do the most logical thing. Obviously, if Emma calls the cops, it really mutes the conclusion that we felt was best for the show, and it felt fair and reasonable that in that moment she defers and doesn’t do it.  Once you introduced Marion Crane (Rihanna), were Norman’s days numbered?  Cuse: There were a couple of guiding principles. We absolutely did not want to end the show in the same way as Psycho. That would have been a profound disappointment and it would deflate the whole intention here, which was to take characters and some of the iconographic imagery from the movie and tell its own story. Our story had its own ending, and so we enjoyed the fun of crossing in and out of the mythology of Psycho at the end. Particularly when we cast Rihanna, we leaned into the fact that the audience would come to it with these very specific expectations based on the movie, and we wanted to flip their expectations on their ear. That was fun to do, but as far as the ending goes, we were never judging it against the ending in Psycho or felt an obligation to connect it to the ending of Psycho. Our obligation at the end was to hopefully have this tragic love story come to a satisfying ending. Sad can be satisfying. We knew it wouldn’t be happy, but we hoped it would be satisfying.  Psycho aside, was there any point where you second-guessed your decision to kill Norman?  Ehrin: No. Certainly a part of you wants to somehow have everything turn out OK just because you love the characters. But this is closer to Wuthering Heights than Harvey. There’s an ending where Norman just walks off into the hills talking to his mother and the sun goes down and everyone’s happy. In my head, that kind of exists, but that wasn’t what we were delivering.  When Norma leaves Norman following Romero’s death, does that close the door on his mental defense case in these murders?  Ehrin: Yes, because he’s alone. He doesn’t have that buffer anymore, and he can’t deal with it. It pushes him over the edge, and it leads him on this journey to recall the past and kind of redo it.  How did you come up with the idea to reincorporate the pilot into the episode?  Cuse: One of the things that’s always satisfying in finales is to remind audiences of the journey they’ve been on. There’s a resonance in rewarding an audience that has watched all 50 episodes of our show with a sense of that journey. Some of it arose from those feelings. It was also a way to make the love story feel epic. The thing that makes something epic is its existence across a large spread of time. We wanted to reconnect the audience to the fact that this love story and relationship was a lifelong journey.  When did you decide that Dylan, Emma and their daughter would live in the sun?  Ehrin: That instinct first came at the end of the second season.  Cuse: We realized the show was heading in a very dark direction, and we felt it was important to have some ray of hope at the end of our narrative. It became clear that early that Dylan and Emma deserved to come out of this with a relatively happy ending.  Ehrin: There was something really interesting toward the end of the second season to have these two people who were both really outside of the Norma-Norman island and couldn’t get on it, that they would find each other and miraculously make their own world together. It made us happy to think about, and it became something that was fun to work toward in the writing. You do try to balance it — even on a purely selfish level for your own self. When you’re living inside of this stuff, it’s very dark, and it’s nice to have strands of hope to hold onto. That played out even in writing Norma and Norman, because you would constantly have to put yourself in denial about the ending. You wanted to always infuse them with hope that things would be better. That they were going to work out of it. It’s an interesting process to write that. It’s very emotionally and physically taxing…it's bizarre.  Was there any talk of having that last shot be the daughter giving the camera a creepy Norman Bates-type smile, rather than ending it on a happier note?  Cuse: That will be the sequel.  Ehrin: We joked about that in the writers' room, that she would be like Baby Norma, but that she would be evil. But no. The kid is good, and Dylan and Emma are good.

Bella Hadid and The Weeknd and robots! Oh my!  On Sunday, the pair once again fueled romance rumors with an outing together in Tokyo. Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) took Hadid to the renowned Robot Restaurant, an extremely unconventional dinner theater experience featuring performers dressed as monsters, animals and yes, robots.  The “Call Out My Name” crooner shared a video on his Instagram Story featuring Hadid cracking up while watching the performance. It ended with one of the restaurant’s robot-costumed actors playfully taking a fall.  Although Tesfaye and Hadid called it quits in 2016, they began to be spotted out together again -- including a PDA-filled night in Cannes back in May -- not long after Selena Gomez and he broke things off in 2017.  As recently as July 2, both Hadid and Tesfaye shared strikingly similar photos, seemingly teasing that they were spending time together. In the singer’s Instagram photo, he looks out over a balcony at what appears to be his home in Hidden Hills, California. Hadid’s image appears to have been taken moments later and features the same view but from further back, and includes the home’s spacious pool.  Until the next time these two cross paths and decide to let their fans know...  Get more news on Hadid in the clip below.

"Former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Hadid was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012—and since then, she's been dealing with severe complications from the condition. (You may remember Gigi Hadid honoring her mother's battle last year.) To make matters worse? Yolanda's two other children, Bella and Anwar, have also been diagnosed with the same illness and continue to undergo treatment. (Eek! By 2015, Lyme disease had spiked 320 percent in the U.S.—and 2017 is set to be even worse.)  My everything in one place....... #HappyMommy #PerfectSummerNight A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Jul 17, 2017 at 7:52pm PDT  Now, Yolanda is opening up about her personal struggles with the illness, including how the disease drove her to contemplate suicide, in her new memoir Believe Me: My Battle with the Invisibility of Lyme Disease.  ""I take off my clothes and slip into the dark blue ocean, which is cool and comforting,"" she writes in her book, as reported by People, referring to the time she was on vacation with her then-husband David Foster. ""The waves gently wash over my naked body, and I can feel the current tugging at me. Tears pour out of my eyes, roll across my cheeks, and meld with the salt water as I try to still my mind to become one with the water's ebb and flow.""  She continues: ""God please just take me away in a wave,"" she writes. ""I can't live like this one more day. Please carry my body away. I just want to disappear."" She went on to say: ""My next thought is a clear image of my three children. It shifts my consciousness immediately and that's the only thing that keeps me from letting myself drift and drown.""  During this time two years ago, Yolanda's illness was forcing her to stay in bed for up to 22 hours a day because of painful symptoms such as joint pain, exhaustion, and insomnia, according to People. Even answering an email became a daunting task, making her feel severely depressed. Her physical and mental health was at an all-time low.  Rather then waiting for the storms to pass we might as well learn to dance in the rain........ #FarmLife #RainyDay #Muddy #JustTheWayILikeIt A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Jul 14, 2017 at 12:34pm PDT  Since then, however, the mother of three has come a long way and is focused on regaining her health. ""As difficult as these past five years have been, I am so grateful that this journey has led me to live in the light,"" she tells People. ""I have had it all and lost it all, only to realize that less is more, money can't buy you health or happiness, and one day at a time is good enough.""  Hadid's memoir hits shelves on September 12."	0
She reunited with Destiny's Child at Coachella in April this year.  But this week Beyonce completed her reunion with the ORIGINAL Destiny's Child when she met up with LaTavia Roberson for this first time in almost two decades.  The meeting came just one week after Bey linked up with fellow evictee LeToya Luckett.  Original: Beyonce had a mini OG Destiny's Child reunion with LaTavia Roberson on Thursday... 18 YEARS after she was booted out of group  Both LaTavia and LeToya were booted from the group by manager — Beyonce's dad — Mathew Knowles — back in 2000.  Nevertheless it looked like there was no bad blood between the former bandmates, as Roberson shared a trio of warm images on Instagram.  'It was so wonderful sharing a laugh and spending time with my FRIEND of 30 yrs.....hadn’t seen Bey in 18 yrs,' she captioned one  She added: 'My mother @cheryl_lastrap is clearly tickled. The children are amazing “Everything IS Love”'  Reunited: Nevertheless it looked like there was no bad blood between the former bandmates, as Roberson shared a trio of warm images on Instagram, along with LaTavia's  'It was so wonderful sharing a laugh and spending time with my FRIEND of 30 yrs.....hadn’t seen Bey in 18 yrs,' she captioned one. 'My mother @cheryl_lastrap is clearly tickled. The children are amazing “Everything IS Love”'  In the snaps, Bey wore a glorious gold and green gown, her hair in gorgeous ringlets.  LaTavia meanwhile showed off her fab figure though a sheer football jersey, showing off a black bra and tiny denim hotpants beneath.  After going through several line-up tweaks and name changes, Destiny's Child was officially formed in 1997 consisting of Beyonce, Kelly Rowland, LaTavia and LeToya, releasing their debut self-title album in 1998.  No hard feelings: The meeting came just one week after Bey linked up with fellow evictee LeToya Luckett  Flashback: After going through several line-up tweaks and name changes, Destiny's Child was officially formed in 1997 consisting of (L-R) Kelly Rowland, Beyonce Knowles, LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Robertson (pictured in February 1998)  But shortly after the release of the 8x platinum second album, The Writings On The Wall, LaTavia and LeToya were ousted from the group.  While they originally sought external management, believing Mathew was dividing the group's profits unfairly in favor on Beyonce and Kelly, it ultimately led to them beilg replaced by Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin.  Franklin in turn was let go after just six months, leaving the final line-up as it is known today.  Beyonce is currently on her On The Run II Tour with husband Jay Z; last week she linked up with a heavily pregnant LeToya for photos at her Arlington Texas show.	0

The 73-year-old announced Tuesday that he was going to try and walk his daughter down the aisle, despite his staged photo controversy — but was then forced to walk the statement back after learning from doctors that he needed heart surgery.  “They will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,” Thomas Markle told TMZ.  The former television lighting director has been recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which left him with a “seriously damaged” heart. Thomas was reportedly back in the hospital on Tuesday undergoing a series of tests.  He had come forward on Monday and said he wasn’t going to be a part of Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials because he didn’t want to embarrass her following the paparazzi photo controversy. But Thomas reportedly slept on it and changed his mind Tuesday morning.  “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle,” he told TMZ. “This is a historic moment.”  While Thomas initially thought the surgery wouldn’t complicate things, he said he now realizes how hard it would be to make the trip across the Pond.  In response to her father not making it, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released a statement late Monday saying: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas told TMZ that his daughter called him on Monday, but he missed the call. She reportedly texted him and said she loved him, was concerned about his health, and didn’t blame him for the staged photos.  The Daily Mail revealed Sunday that Thomas secretly collaborated with a paparazzi agency to set up the pics, which showed him reading stories about his daughter’s wedding and getting fitted for a suit.  Sources told The Post that he was “set up” by the LA-based company, identified as the Coleman-Rayner News Picture Agency.  They apparently took pics of Thomas drinking and entering a fleabag hotel — and threatened to release them if he didn’t agree to pose for them.  “They told him if he posed, they wouldn’t put out the other pictures,” a source explained. “They told him they’d make him look good. They also gave him a few bucks for his trouble.”  Coleman-Rayner did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment about the alleged setup.  While Queen Elizabeth II was reportedly “very angry” about the photo controversy, Thomas told TMZ he didn’t think she really cared at all.  “I don’t think the queen is thinking about what I’m doing,” he said.	0
Joel Madden took to Instagram yesterday to share a snap of his very famous family all hanging out together, and we are loving their matchy-matchy style. In the photo, the rocker poses alongside his wife Nicole Richie and her dad Lionel Richie, as well as his twin brother Benji Madden and his wife Cameron Diaz. And it seems like they even color-coordinated for the occasion. Each of the celebs opted to wear all-black for the outing except for Nicole, who added a blue blazer and printed scarf to top off her dark outfit.  The only members of their brood missing? Joel and Nicole's two adorable children, 8-year-old Harlow and 7-year-old Sparrow.	1
NATIONAL ROSÉ DAY  National Rosé Day is observed annually on the second Saturday in June. Rosé is probably the oldest known type of wine, dating back as far as 600 BC. Rosé wines are generally made from red grapes and are very versatile wines that complement many types of food. Rosé is lighter than red wine and deeper than white wine. The pink color of rosé wine depends on the time the grape skin stays in contact with the juice, also known as maceration. There are rosé wines that are semi-sparkling or sparkling, with different intensities of sweetness levels and dryness.  HOW TO OBSERVE  Celebrate National Rosé Day by having a bottle of Rosé wine with dinner or simply invite friends over for h’orderves and enjoy each other’s company. Share your special evening on Social Media on Facebook@NationalRoséDay and Instagram@nationalroseday using #NationalRoséDay.

NBC’s “Today” has demonstrated success in using its famous brand name beyond the traditional two-hour morning block. The program added the 9 a.m. hour in 2000 and 10 a.m. in 2008 with Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. The expanded hours give the network more commercials to sell while incurring relatively modest production costs as the programs are done in the same studio as the flagship program.	1

"George Clooney is a generous friend to say the least.  The 56-year-old actor's close pal and Casamigos business partner, Rande Gerber, recently claimed the actor once gave 14 of his close friends -- which he referred to as ""The Boys"" -- $1 million each as a surprise gift in 2013. Gerber dropped the jaw-dropping tidbit during his appearance on MSNBC's Headliners.  ... And the amazing monetary gift wasn't all. Gerber said that Clooney also paid his friends' taxes for the year.  ""There’s a group of guys we call 'The Boys,'"" Gerber shared. ""George had called me and 'The Boys' and said, 'Hey, mark September 27th, 2013, on your calendar. Everyone’s going to come to my house for dinner.'""  At the dinner, Clooney's pals were surprised with designer luggage bags at each seat on the table -- each containing a million dollars in $20 bills. Gerber noted that not all of the actor's friends were rich, with some struggling to support their families.  ""George begins to say, 'Listen, I want you guys to know how much you've meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,'"" Gerber recalled. ""'I came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I'm so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn't be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we’re still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases.'""  Not surprisingly, Gerber said he and the actor's pals were ""in shock.""  ""Every one of us -- 14 of us -- got a million dollars,"" he marveled. ""Every single one of us. We're in shock. Like, what is this? He goes, 'I know we've all been through some hard times, some of you are still going through it. You don't have to worry about your kids, you don't have to worry about, you know, school, you don't have to worry about paying your mortgage.'""  ""I mean these are guys that took care of George and now he’s giving it all back,"" Gerber added. ""And George said, 'Not only that, I have paid everyone's taxes so this million dollars is yours.'""  Gerber -- who is independently wealthy -- said he insisted on not accepting the gift, but Clooney refused. The businessman said he ended up donating his million dollars to charity.  Although, Gerber noted that Clooney may have gotten his own reward for his generous gift.  ""That was September 27th, 2013. Now September 27, 2014, he marries Amal,"" he pointed out. ""That's good karma right there.""  In October, Gerber hosted an epic Casamigos Halloween party, escorting both his wife, supermodel Cindy Crawford, and Amal Clooney.

© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  Ariel Winter slammed the media and body shamers in a lengthy Twitter rant on Monday night. The star, who recently opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about her estranged relationship with her mother, also defended her interview after it sparked some backlash online.    In a series of tweets posted late Monday night, the “Modern Family” actress wrote, “Rant – Something I wish people would realize… I am NOT trying to be featured on Snapchat, I am not trying to be pap’d everywhere I go, I am literally just LIVING and unfortunately, I can’t do that without paparazzi following me around everyday. I’m not trying to show you my a-- in shorts when I go to the grocery store. I’m trying to live my life. People wear shorts. People have wardrobe malfunctions. No one is perfect.”  Winter continued, “I don’t know what to wear everyday so I look ‘appropriate’ and ‘fashionable.’ Also, screw to always having to look appropriate and fashionable. For what? Society? Who gets to decide what is appropriate and fashionable? I wear what I like and no one should fault me for that. I don’t want people to constantly see me in the news for going to dinner, or grocery shopping, or anything. I want to be in the news when I ASK for it by going to a publicized event. So trust me, I don’t want to see me in shorts putting water in my car every single d--- day as much as you don’t.”  She went on to address the cruel criticism she received after her interview with The Hollywood Reporter, in which she spoke openly about being sexualized by her mother at a young age. “I’d also like to address the tweets I get saying ‘you accused your own mother of sexualizing you yet you’re a w----.’ I was a CHILD being dressed like I was 24. I was 8-13 years old. I wasn’t an ADULT as I am now. As a child, you do what you’re told regardless of what is good for you,” Winter said. The star added, “Just because I DECIDE to show my body occasionally doesn’t mean I’m unintelligent or that I’m talentless or that I have no self respect.”  As Gossip Cop reported, Winter slammed the suggestion that she was “asking for it” by posting a photo on Instagram of herself wearing a bikini while on a boat with her nieces in 2015. After she uploaded the picture on social media, the comments section soon filled with remarks criticizing the actress’s body. Winter later wrote, “It sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I’m ‘asking for it.’ Celebrate you and don’t let anyone’s comments allow you to think less of yourself. Us girls have to stick together!!!”  Related video: Ariel Winter wore a rubber dress to an Emmy's pre-party, and here's where you can get one just like it (Provided by Hello Giggles)	1

"It's not exactly a secret that the cast of Riverdale loves to troll each other on social media. Their Instagram interactions are among the funniest things we've scrolled through, and there's no telling how epic their pranks will be when they team up with one another . For the latest social media moment between the CW costars, Cole Sprouse revealed that not even his closest costars qualify for a discount on his photography services.  In an Instagram post shared on Thursday, December 20, Cole shared that he would be taking some time to resume his photography work. ""Back home for the holidays, going to focus on portfolio work again,"" he wrote. ""Looking to scout new locations and work with new talent. Need that photographic therapy.""  The star didn't detail whether any of his upcoming shots might include Lili Reinhart, but one Riverdale cast member inquired about working with Cole. As pointed out by the commentsbyceleb Instagram account , Mark Consuelos wrote that he needed a new headshot ""please."" There's no word on whether his new headshot might be used in lieu of his family's hilarious Christmas card , but it seems unlikely that Cole will be stepping in as his photographer.  ""I'm too expensive for you,"" Cole replied. And with that, it would seem that Mark's headshot dreams are forever crushed.  Cole might not be up for photographing Mark's new headshot, but we may know of two other Riverdale friends that could always do in a pinch. As KJ Apa and Casey Cott recently demonstrated , the pair are more than happy to recreate some of Cole's most notable work.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel this spring, and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  Fans have eagerly been waiting to hear which celebrities scored an invite to what's sure to be the biggest event of the year, and this week, we learned that one of Meghan's closest pals, Priyanka Chopra, will for sure be in attendance. ""Yes I'm going,"" the Quantico star confirmed during her guest appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Thursday. ""But that's all.""  Chopra told People, however, that she is ""not a bridesmaid,"" despite all the speculation in recent months that she would be in the bridal party.  As for the groom, Prince Harry has finally picked his Best Man, and, unsurprisingly, it's Prince William! The Duke of Cambridge joked earlier this year that he was expecting to fulfill the role, but his brother had yet to ask him. We're happy to report that Harry made it official on Thursday.  ""The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St. George’s Chapel,"" Kensington Palace shared in a statement.  Meanwhile, Meghan has been busy wrapping up all the last minute details ahead of her and Harry's nuptials. A source told ET on Tuesday that Amal Clooney's go-to hairdresser in London, Miguel Perez, is expected to style Meghan's tresses on her big day. He's currently a stylist at Salon Sloane, whose world-leading hairstylists have worked on everyone from Lindsay Lohan to the Victoria's Secret Angels.  ""Yes, I do Meghan's hair,"" Miguel reportedly told The Mail this week. ""I do Amal's, and Meghan is friends with her. I also do George [Clooney]'s, I do the whole family. Amal put Meghan and me together when she moved here [to London]. I do her color, her cut and her styling.""  ""We have talked about it [the wedding] and we have a plan,"" he continued. ""I can't say any more, but we know what we're doing.""  Meghan and Harry also chose the music for their wedding service this week, and it will include a full orchestra. St. George's Chapel's Director of Music, James Vivian, will direct the music, which features a selection of choral groups, soloists and musicians, Kensington Palace revealed on Tuesday.  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be saying ""I do"" in:  Getty Images  OUT AND ABOUT  The lovebirds took a brief break from wedding planning early Wednesday morning to represent the royal family at the Anzac Day Service in London, England.  Anzac Day is a day of remembrance for soldiers from Australia and New Zealand who've served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Both countries are a part of the Commonwealth, of which Queen Elizabeth II serves as leader.  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  As we anxiously wait to see what Meghan's wedding dresses will look like, there's also talks about what tiara she will be gifted with. There's a good chance that the bride-to-be will debut a brand-new tiara as she walks down the aisle, royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of the blog The Court Jeweler told Good Housekeeping earlier this week.  ""The younger son's wife getting a new tiara would be the precedent,"" she explained. ""Prince Charles might buy her a tiara.""  Previous royal brides like Sarah, Duchess of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, received major bling on their wedding day. But, the circumstances are different for Kate Middleton, who wore the Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding, since she will eventually become queen, and will ""borrow"" tiaras in the meantime.  ""Usually what happens is you get allotted your tiaras,"" Kay explained. ""Like Camilla [Duchess of Cornwall] has three, but they're all technically loaners that not anyone else wears.""  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  Getty Images  Meghan outdid herself with not one, but two regal looks in one day.  While stepping out to the Anzac Day service, the 36-year-old brunette beauty donned an elegant gray Smythe coat with a black dress underneath, Sarah Flint Jay heels, a Gucci Dionysus bag, a red poppy pin and a statement wide-brimmed, floppy hat. This type of hat is much simpler than the fancy fascinators and pillbox hats we typically see on royals like Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cambridge, but we love that Meghan put her own unique spin on the trend.  For her second look of the day, Meghan opted for a more formal ensemble. The bride-to-be arrived to Westminster Abbey in a black beret embellished with a dragonfly from milliner Philip Treacy, which she pulled off perfectly by pairing it with a midi-length Emilia Wickstead dress suit and a Jimmy Choo box clutch.  SERVIN' UP SUITS  USA Network  Sadly, this section of our weekly royals countdown ends this week, as Meghan appeared in her very last episode of Suits on Wednesday.  In case you missed it, we recapped the full finale (HERE).  You had a good run, Rachel Zane.  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Earlier this week, ET caught up with one of Meghan's former makeup artists, Spencer Barnes, who opened up about her evolving beauty looks and how when he was still doing her makeup, Meghan always requested a natural look.  ""She loves beautiful skin, to start with, and she has the most gorgeous complexion,"" Barnes mused. ""It's that soft, caramel. Her mixed heritage makes her an exotic beauty of beauties. Her chocolate eyes, the way her eyes light up when she smiles, I love her smile, her teeth and her lips. And then her perfect brows.""  ""Whenever I'd work with her, she'd like to highlight her fresh, radiant skin,"" he continued. ""We'd do a very glowing, fresh-faced skin. We'd use earthy tones, colors that enhanced her natural beauty, rather than a lot of obvious color choices, like purple, green or blue. We'd stick with earthy tones -- peaches, golds, browns -- a lot of rich, warm tones and that really flattered her. It helped her just look radiant and fresh.""

LOL OF THE WEEK  Prince George and Princess Charlotte arrive at St Mary’s to meet their little brother. pic.twitter.com/rfX9rsdJhU — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 23, 2018  Spectators couldn't get enough of Princess Charlotte this week. While on her way to meet her new baby brother, the adorable 2-year-old stole the show when she smiled and waved to photographers on her way into the hospital, proving she's already an expert at royalty.  NEXT IN LINE  Jack Taylor/Getty Images  Welcome to the royal family, Prince Louis of Cambridge!  Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child, Louis Arthur Charles, on Monday, and just hours after giving birth, the Duchess of Cambridge and her husband stepped out to pose for pictures outside St. Mary's Hospital before making their way back to Kensington Palace. Kate channeled Princess Diana in a stunning red Jenny Packham dress, cradling her precious baby boy with William by her side.  Toby Melville - WPA Pool/Getty Images  But there was no down time for the new dad. William joined Harry and Meghan at the Anzac Day Service on Wednesday, and also attended the opening of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London one day later with his brother. Hopefully William can catch up on some rest and family time this weekend!  For now, that's a wrap on this week's royals update.

Beverly Marsh’s hair is winter fire, January embers. Jessica Chastain’s heart burns there, too.  Maybe.  The Zero Dark Thirty actress is in talks to join the sequel to Stephen King’s It, playing the adult version of the flame-haired character who inspired that secret admirer’s poem, EW has confirmed.  Ever since New Line announced that King’s epic 1986 novel would be split into two parts, it has been obvious to most people, including director Andy Muschietti, that Chastain would be perfect to play the grown-up Bev, who returns to the town of Derry with her fellow Losers nearly 27 years later to face the evil, shapeless presence they defeated as children.  Chastain previously worked with Muschietti on the 2013 horror film Mama, and during post-production on It, the filmmaker told EW he hoped to recruit her to the Losers’ Club if the sequel became a reality. Now that It stands as the highest grossing horror film of all time, with $700 million in earnings worldwide, things are pretty real.  Variety first reported that Chastain is in talks for the film, which is scheduled for release in September 2019. Bill Skarsgård is also set to return as the malevolent clown — one of It’s favorite forms.  Sophia Lillis played the young Bev Marsh in the original, and she would also return for the sequel, performing new scenes as the character in flashback.  Those who know King’s book are aware that although Beverly survived her first encounter with Pennywise, and her abusive father, she carries with her deep, invisible wounds that have led her to another toxic relationship.  All of the Losers will have traumas that linger from their youth in Derry, and the resurrection of Pennywise serves as the catalyst for dealing with the more mundane monsters who plague them in adulthood.  Muschietti talked about some of what to expect from Chapter 2 in this EW interview after the debut of It.	0
"Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is a retired American actress who became a member of the British royal family upon her marriage to Prince Harry.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. An outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. She represented international charity organisations in the 2010s. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements as part of the British royal family. She became the Duchess of Sussex on her marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.  Early life and education [ edit ]  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr., from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her ""dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.""[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Procter & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career [ edit ]  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a ""briefcase girl"" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: ""Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.""[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and ""actively re-positioned"" her character from ingenue to ""the show's moral conscience"" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her ""desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings"".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was ""Tig Talk"", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked ""everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years"".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as ""aspirational girl next door"", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life [ edit ]  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and concluded a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55] Markle's subsequent relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello lasted almost two years, ending in May 2016.[56]  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[57][58] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[59] His grandmother Elizabeth II is queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, as well as Head of the Commonwealth.[60] The couple met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] In November, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[62] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[63][64][65] In September 2017, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[66][67]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, where the show is filmed.[68] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[69]  Royal marriage [ edit ]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017 by Clarence House and Kensington Palace.[57][70] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[71] The ring Harry gave Markle was made by Cleave & Company Ltd., and consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[72]  Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[73][74] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[75] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[76] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[76] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[77]  The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[78] They are expecting their first child, who would be seventh in line to the throne, in 2019.[79] The couple will move to Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle's Home Park following the birth, but their office will continue to operate at Kensington Palace.[80][81]  Public life [ edit ]  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[82][83] in connection with World AIDS Day.[84] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[85] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[84] Cardiff,[86] Goldsmiths' Hall,[87] and Edinburgh.[88] On February 28, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, ""Making a Difference Together"" with the prince.[89] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[90] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[91] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12.[92] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23.[93] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[94]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband celebrated the charity work of his father, Prince Charles.[95] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July.[96][97] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[98]  The Duchess takes part in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which includes overseas tours.[99] The first such trip was to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand in October 2018.[100][101] Despite the low support for the monarchy in Australia, the couple were greeted by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of the Duchess's pregnancy hours after arrival was enthusiastically received by the public and media.[101][102]  Fashion and style [ edit ]  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored ""that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up"".[103] In her youth, Markle's ""sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style"" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers ""streamlined dresses"" with ""neutral colors"" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes ""monochromatic and tonal dressing"".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by a wide variety of fashion designers.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for redefining ""modern royal style with every subsequent appearance"".[112] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, the Duchess of Sussex appeared in a Karen Gee dress which resulted in the breakdown of the designer's website.[113]  Charity work [ edit ]  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[115] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[116] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[117][118][119]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[120][121][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[122] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[123] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[120][124] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[125]  In September 2018, the Duchess announced her support for a charity cookbook (for which she wrote the Foreword) titled Together: Our Community Cookbook.[126][127] The book, which is written by women from the Grenfell community, features recipes from around the world.[128] Meghan, who has regularly visited the Hubb Community Kitchen since January 2018,[128] said in a statement: ""Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive.""[126]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World, and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[129][130][131] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[132]  Titles, styles, and arms [ edit ]  Titles and styles [ edit ]  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[133][134] She is styled as ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"",[135] and she is the first person to hold that title.[136]  Arms [ edit ]  Ancestry [ edit ]  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[140] and on her father's side from German,[141] English,[142] and Irish settlers.[143] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[141] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[144][145]  Filmography [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  References [ edit ]"	0
HARTFORD, Conn. — A Connecticut man who pretended to be pop stars like Justin Bieber and Harry Styles to entice young girls into performing sexual acts during online video chats has been sentenced to 17 years in prison.  Federal prosecutors say 50-year-old John Eastman, of Waterbury, was also sentenced Tuesday to a lifetime of probation.  Prosecutors say Eastman contacted girls through online video chatting services in 2012 using screen names such as justin.bieber727 and Harry.Styles888 and enticed them into sexually explicit conduct, which he then recorded and saved on his computer. He also used previously recorded videos the singers had uploaded on YouTube to further deceive the girls.  He was arrested in May 2013 and pleaded guilty in March.  Eastman has 31 past convictions, including for sex-related crimes.	1

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are putting in a pool, according to TMZ , which says it obtained copies of building permits for the in-progress pool at the couple's Hidden Hills estate. Aerial photos published by TMZ indicate the pool—reportedly clocking in at 20-by-60 feet—is already well in development, although it's unclear when it will be complete. TMZ also reported that the Wests spent another $12,000 on building a new guard shack. Whether this is specifically to deter would-be skinny-dippers, or if it's just another add-on to their already tight security team, is unclear.  There's no word on who designed the pool, but it would not be surprising if it turned out to be Kanye West himself. In May , the multihyphenate added another hyphen when he announced he was starting a new architecture firm called Yeezy Home. ""We’re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better,"" he wrote on Twitter. As Architectural Digest reported, this wasn't just a ploy to expand his résumé—he worked with Axel Vervoordt on the Hidden Hills home, sharing photos of its Zen Brutalist aesthetic on Twitter.  It would also not be surprising if West got pretty hands-on in the construction of his new pool. In a previous interview with Architectural Digest , Kim Kardashian West revealed that her husband is quite the builder. ""My husband makes all of his own furniture in his office,"" she said. ""My office is all Vincent Van Duysen, but Kanye is so good at it, he loves to draw out pieces. Axel made a couch in our house called the 'Kanye couch' because Kanye designed it with him."""	1
"Vanessa Kirby addresses Tom Cruise romance rumors  Vanessa Kirby is setting the record straight on her love life.  On Wednesday, July 4, 2018, The Crown star addressed reports romantically linking her with Mission: Impossible — Fallout co-star Tom Cruise. Speculation surrounding their rumored romance began in May 2017 after the two were spotted kissing while filming a scene for the action movie.  ""Even though the crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, 'The next wife falls at his feet,'"" Kirby began during an interview with the August 2018 issue of Marie Claire UK. At the time, she had already been in her current relationship with actor Callum Turner for nearly two years.  The Netflix star added, ""The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn't think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, 'Are you OK?' I don't think they believe anything they read now because you just can't. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.""  While there are a number of real-life couples who did actually meet on set, Kirby, 30, and Cruise, 56, clearly are not one of them. However, the tabloid fodder gave the actress a crash course in how to balance her newfound fame with keeping her personal life private.  ""It's a weird feeling. I definitely don't feel it yet. I've been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,"" Kirby continued. ""[Turner's] just completely wonderful and he's my best friend, so that's … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not. If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don't, then it's not.""  Kirby isn't the only celeb to recently dismiss relationship rumors. As Nicki Swift previously reported, Nikki Bella posted a video on YouTube over the weekend to reveal that she and former fiancé John Cena are not actually back together after announcing their split in mid-April. ""Right now, we're just friends,"" the WWE star told her fans amid rumors of the former couple's rekindled romance. ""We're working on each other and trying to work on us, and we talk every day."""	0
Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum‘s sudden split after nearly nine years of marriage came as a shock to fans, but there were signs the couple were drifting apart over the last few months.  The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE, saying, “We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple.” They added, “There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In early March, Dewan, 37, walked the red carpet at the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after party without Tatum. When asked where the actor was, she told Entertainment Tonight he was home with their 4-year-old daughter Everly.  “He is so happy to have a night off, yes,” she said. Not long after, Tatum, also 37, was spotted dining with a group of friends at Craig’s restaurant without Dewan Tatum.  RELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan ‘Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate’ After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage  But the actress’s Oscars date night with BFF Emmanuelle Chriqui also wasn’t the only recent solo outing as of late.  Days after the Oscars, Dewan spent the day practicing her magic with Everly at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Los Angeles.  The couple — who often gushed about each other on social media — were also uncharacteristically mum over the last few months on their accounts.  However, as buzz of a split grew louder, they put on a united front and attended the Kids’ Choice Awards together with their daughter and also shared cute snaps of a recent pool and face painting day in March.  In February, Dewan opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a “perfect life,” saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.  “When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.”  Dewan said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn’t get along.  “But I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,” she continued. “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.”  Musing on the institution of marriage, Dewan said, “I don’t think there should be any expectation, any sort of ‘You’re bonded to me for the rest of your life,’ thick and thin. I think that’s an older generational thought.”  And while the former couple was known for posting countless photos together on social media, Tatum last posted about Dewan in December. He celebrated the actress’ birthday with a heartfelt message.  “This creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,” he wrote. “By doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.”  The two first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up, and began dating shortly after. They tied the knot in 2009.	0

In 2017, she received acclaim for her portrayal of legendary Hollywood actress Joan Crawford in the television series Feud, for which she received her eighth Emmy, sixteenth Golden Globe and sixth Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.  In addition to acting, Lange is a photographer with three published works.[7] She has also been a foster parent[8] and currently holds a Goodwill Ambassador position for UNICEF, specializing in HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Russia.[9][10]  Early life and education [ edit ]  Lange was born in Cloquet, Minnesota, on April 20, 1949. Her father, Albert John Lange (1913–1989), was a teacher and traveling salesman, and her mother, Dorothy Florence (née Sahlman; 1913–1998), was a housewife. Third of four children, she has two older sisters Jane, Ann and a younger brother named George.[11] Her paternal ancestry originates in Germany and the Netherlands, while her maternal ancestry originates in Finland.[12][13][14] Due to the nature of her father's professions, her family moved over a dozen times to various towns and cities in Minnesota before settling back down in her hometown, where she graduated from Cloquet High School.[15]  In 1967, she received a scholarship to study art and photography at the University of Minnesota, where she met and began dating Spanish photographer Paco Grande.[8] After the two married in 1971, Lange left college to pursue a more bohemian lifestyle, traveling in the United States and Mexico in a minivan with Grande.[8][15] The couple then moved to Paris, where they drifted apart. While in Paris, Lange studied mime theatre under the supervision of Étienne Decroux, and joined the Opéra-Comique as a dancer.[8]  Career [ edit ]  1970s [ edit ]  While sharing an apartment with Jerry Hall and Grace Jones, she was discovered by fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez[16] and subsequently became a model for the Wilhelmina modelling agency. In 1973, she returned to the States and began work in New York City as a waitress at the Lion's Head Tavern in Greenwich Village.[8] While modelling, Lange was discovered by Hollywood producer Dino De Laurentiis, who was looking to cast his next leading lady, an ingenue for his remake of the 1933 King Kong. Lange made her film debut in the 1976 King Kong, beating actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn for the role of damsel-in-distress.[citation needed] Despite being a box-office success – it became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 – and receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the film and her performance were widely panned.[17] However, renowned film critic Pauline Kael praised her, noting, ""The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange's fast yet dreamy comic style. [She] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in My Man Godfrey, [and] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they're in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye and you like her, the way people liked Lombard.""[18] Lange went on to win the 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She would remain a favorite of Kael's, who would later comment, ""She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too.""[19]  At the close of the decade, Bob Fosse, whom Lange had befriended and with whom she had carried on a casual romantic affair, cast Lange as the Angel of Death, a part that he had written specifically for her in his semiautobiographical film, All That Jazz (1979). She had also been considered for the role of Wendy Torrance in The Shining before that role ultimately went to Shelley Duvall.  1980s [ edit ]  Lange began the new decade in the light romp How to Beat the High Cost of Living (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it received mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which he was working with Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for Goin' South (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981).[20] Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.  While editing The Postman Always Rings Twice, Graeme Clifford realized he had found the leading lady for his next film – his first as a director; a biographical film of actress Frances Farmer, whose disillusionment with Hollywood and chaotic family background led her down a tragic path.[21] Filming Frances (1982), which co-starred Kim Stanley and Sam Shepard, was a grueling experience for Lange, who pored over the screenplay scene by scene, making deep and often taxing connections between her life and Farmer's to tap into the well of emotions the role required.[21] By the end of the shoot, she was physically and mentally spent.[21] Due to this, she decided to take her co-star Stanley's advice to star in ""something light"", which led her to accept a supporting role opposite Dustin Hoffman in Sydney Pollack's Tootsie (1982).  In 1982, Lange became the first performer in 40 years to receive two Academy Award nominations in the same year,[5] scoring a nomination for her work in Frances and eventually winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in Tootsie, which not only became the second-highest-grossing film of 1982, following Steven Spielberg's E.T., but which also scored an additional nine Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture. Her performance in the film also earned her a Golden Globe, along with awards from the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics, and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Lange also won Best Actress at the Moscow International Film Festival for her performance in Frances.[5]  Lange next produced and starred, again opposite Shepard, in 1984's Country, a topical film depicting a family during the farm crisis. Her performance earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. That same year, she made her television debut as Maggie the Cat, starring opposite Tommy Lee Jones in a CBS Playhouse production of Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. The following year, she testified before the United States Congress on behalf of the Democratic House Task Force on Agriculture, alongside Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, whom she later neighbored and befriended.[22]  At the close of 1985, she portrayed legendary country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz's biopic, Sweet Dreams, opposite Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, and John Goodman. She was nominated a fourth time for an Oscar and came in second place for both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress.[23][24] In several interviews, Meryl Streep has stated that she ""begged"" Reisz, who directed her in 1981's The French Lieutenant's Woman, for the role of Cline, but that his first choice had always been Lange. Streep has also been quite vocal and adamant in her praise for Lange's performance,[25][26][27][28] calling her ""beyond wonderful"" in the film and stating, ""I couldn't imagine doing it as well or even coming close to what Jessica did because she was so amazing in it.""[25] In 2018, Streep further commented, ""Jessica did it better than any human being could possibly have done it.""[29] Streep has also admitted, ""Every job I've ever taken, about three weeks before I begin, I call up my agent and say, 'I don't think I can do this. I don't think I'm right for it. They should call up Jessica Lange.'""[30]  Lange's films throughout the mid- to late 1980s, which included Crimes of the Heart (1986), Far North (1988), and Everybody's All-American (1989), were mostly low profile and underperformed at the box office, though she was often singled out and praised for her work.[citation needed] In 1989, she starred in Costa-Gavras' Music Box Lange played a Hungarian lawyer defending her father of Nazi war crimes. Her performance earned her a fifth Academy Award nomination and a sixth Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.  1990s [ edit ]  Lange continued making films throughout the 1990s, periodically taking time off to raise her children and also choosing theater- and television-based projects. She began the decade in Paul Brickman's warmly received Men Don't Leave (1990), for which she earned positive reviews and came in third place for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress.[31] She was then approached by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who had both auditioned her for the role of Jake LaMotta's wife in Raging Bull (1981), to star in a remake of Cape Fear (1991). The film became the 12th-highest-grossing film of the year. In 1992, Lange once again starred opposite Robert De Niro in Irwin Winkler's Night and the City and also starred in a television adaptation of Willa Cather's O Pioneers!, receiving her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Her Broadway debut, which was met by mixed reviews, also occurred that same year when she portrayed Blanche DuBois in a production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, opposite Alec Baldwin.[citation needed]  In 1994, Lange was lauded for her performance as a manic depressive army wife in the 1960s in Tony Richardson's final film, Blue Sky. In 1995, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress, along with the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the Utah Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, and the Sant Jordi Award for Best Actress. She also came in second place for the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress.  In 1995, she followed her victory with further critically lauded performances in Losing Isaiah, opposite Halle Berry, and Rob Roy, with Liam Neeson. That same year, Lange reprised her role as Blanche DuBois in a CBS television adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire, opposite Alec Baldwin, Diane Lane, and John Goodman. She received glowing reviews for her performance, which earned her fourth Golden Globe Award and her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.  In 1996, Lange made her London stage debut in another performance as Blanche DuBois, which received rave reviews. The following year, she starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, A Thousand Acres. Lange received her ninth Golden Globe Award nomination and won the Venice Film Festival's Schermi d'Amore award for her performance in the film. In 1998, she starred opposite Elisabeth Shue in a film adaptation of Balzac's Cousin Bette, for which she received strong reviews. That same year, Lange also starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in the somewhat cult classic, Hush, which generally received negative reviews. Roger Ebert, however, praised Lange's performance, commenting, ""The film's most intriguing element is the performance by Jessica Lange, who by not going over the top provides Martha with a little pathos to leaven the psychopathology.""[32]  Lange received strong reviews for her performance in Titus, Julie Taymor's 1999 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming. Film critic for Entertainment Weekly, Lisa Schwarzbaum, included Lange in a ""for your consideration"" article directed at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She commented, ""Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words 'Academy Awards' should never be a surprise. But everything about her daring performance in Titus as Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, is an astonishment. Donning breastplates, vowing vengeance, tearing into Shakespeare for the first time as if nothing could be more fun, Lange steals the show — and when the star of the show is Anthony Hopkins, that's grand theft.""[33]  2000s [ edit ]  Lange (2009)  Lange began the new millennium with a London stage production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, playing the part of the ""morphine""-addicted Mary Tyrone, for which she became the first American actress to receive an Olivier Award nomination.[citation needed]  She appeared mostly in supporting roles thereafter, most notably opposite Christina Ricci in the 2001 adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's best-selling memoir on depression, Prozac Nation. In 2003, Lange starred opposite Tom Wilkinson in HBO's Normal, a film about a man who reveals to his wife his decision to have a sex change, for which she received nominations for the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. She followed this with performances in the Bob Dylan vehicle, Masked and Anonymous (2003), Tim Burton's Big Fish (2003), Jim Jarmusch's Broken Flowers (2005) and Wim Wenders' Don't Come Knocking (2005), before starring in a Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie for which she received generally mixed reviews.[citation needed] She later starred with Tammy Blanchard in a remake of Sybil in 2007.  In 2009, Lange co-starred as Big Edie, opposite Drew Barrymore, in HBO's Grey Gardens, directed by Michael Sucsy and based on the 1975 documentary of the same name. The film was a huge success, garnering 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and winning five. Lange won her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie after two previous nominations in the same category. She also received her eleventh Golden Globe Award nomination and second Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance, losing both awards to Barrymore.  2010s [ edit ]  In 2011, Lange joined the cast of FX's horror anthology series American Horror Story. Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk originally wrote her part as a supporting character, but after Lange acquired the role, they expanded it considerably. Murphy, a long-time admirer of Lange, stated that he chose her because he wanted to expose her work to a new generation of viewers.[34] He also singled out her performance as Blanche DuBois on Broadway in 1992, which he saw twice, as his favorite performance, citing it as another motivating factor in hiring Lange.[35] The show was a huge success not only for the network and creators, but also for Lange, who experienced a resurgence in her popularity, receiving rave reviews and several awards for her controversial role. She was chosen by TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, and MTV for giving one of the ""best performances of 2011"".[36][37][38] In addition, she won a second Primetime Emmy Award, a fifth Golden Globe Award, and her first Screen Actors Guild Award, after two previous nominations. She was also awarded a Special Achievement Satellite Award for Outstanding Performance in a Television Series by the International Press Academy and the Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association (GALECA). She was further nominated for the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, Critics' Choice Television Award, and Saturn Award.  In 2012, she had a supporting role in her Grey Gardens director Michael Suscy's box-office hit The Vow, opposite Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams, but also returned to star as the lead in the second season of American Horror Story, titled American Horror Story: Asylum. Once again, she was chosen by TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly for giving one of the ""best performances of 2012"".[39][40] She won a second Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the GALECA, and received a fifth Emmy nomination, a thirteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a second Saturn Award nomination, and a second Critics' Choice Television Award nomination.  In 2013, the third season of American Horror Story, American Horror Story: Coven, garnered the series its highest ratings to that point, and has held the record for garnering the series its highest on-average ratings.[41] Lange was joined by fellow film actors Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. For her work on the show, Lange earned a third Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries,[42] a third Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year[43] and her first Critic's Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries.[44] She also received her fourteenth Golden Globe nomination, her fifth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination and her fifth Satellite Award nomination for her performance on the series. In addition, Lange replaced Glenn Close in a film adaptation of Émile Zola's Thérèse Raquin, directed by Charlie Stratton and titled In Secret, co-starring Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Felton, Oscar Isaac, and Matt Lucas for which she received rave reviews.[45]  Lange began 2014 by being honored with a nomination for a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it.[46] Lange was also recognized by Elle Magazine with the L'Oreal de Paris Legend Award[47] presented to her by her friend Shirley MacLaine during The Women in Hollywood Awards, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing.[48] She was next honored with and became the first female recipient of the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film, presented to her by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.[49]  Later in the year, Marc Jacobs chose Lange to be the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. In addition, Lange would be featured in the brand's summer and fall print ad campaign photographed by David Sims, and would also star in a short campaign film directed by Jacobs.[50] Previously, Jacobs dressed and interviewed Lange for Love magazine's fifth-anniversary issue, and had her provide a spoken-word version of ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" as the soundtrack for his autumn/winter 2014 show.[50][51] She next starred opposite Mark Wahlberg in the remake of the 1970s action-thriller, The Gambler, receiving rave reviews for her work. She also led the fourth season of American Horror Story, titled American Horror Story: Freak Show. The series, once again, topped its and the network's highest ratings, breaking all ratings records for both.[52] Though self-admittedly not a singer, Lange's covers of David Bowie's ""Life on Mars"" and Lana Del Rey's ""Gods and Monsters"" for the show were both hugely popular, receiving heavy circulation on YouTube and charting in the top 50 on the iTunes music charts.[53] For her work on the show, Lange received her seventh Primetime Emmy Award nomination, her fifteenth Golden Globe nomination, and her fourth Critics' Choice Television Award nomination. In 2015, Lange announced that she would not return for the series' fifth season.[54] She followed her final season on American Horror Story with role opposite Shirley MacLaine and Demi Moore in the road-trip comedy, Wild Oats, which wrapped production at the end of 2014.

The show was a critical and box-office hit, becoming the most Tony-nominated play of the season. For her performance, Lange garnered her first Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play nomination and win, an Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Lead Actress after one previous nomination, a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play, and a BroadwayWorld.com Award for Best Leading Actress in a Play. She was also nominated for a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance, a Time Out New York Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play, and a Broadway.com Audience Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a Play.[6]  On November 12, 2016, Lange was honored at the Camerimage Film Festival, where she was awarded the Krzysztof Kieślowski Award for Acting.[57]  Lange next starred in FX's anthology series, Feud, also serving as producer alongside Susan Sarandon, who also co-starred, and executive producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. The first season revolved around the infamous rivalry between Hollywood legends Bette Davis (Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Lange), which came to a head during the making of the classic film, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. Alfred Molina, Stanley Tucci, Judy Davis and Catherine Zeta-Jones co-starred. Production began in the fall of 2016 and it was released on March 5, 2017.[58] The series was a critical and ratings hit, garnering Lange her eighth Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, her sixteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, her sixth SAG Award nomination, her fourth Critics Choice Award nomination and her second TCA Award nomination for Individual Achievement in Drama.

Lange is also lined up to star opposite Naomi Watts in Gia Coppola's second film, The Lonely Doll, adapted from Jean Nathan's memoir, The Search for Dare Wright: The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll, which chronicled the life of Dare Wright and her tempestuous relationship with her mother, Edith Stevenson Wright.[60]  Personal life [ edit ]  Lange was married to photographer Francisco ""Paco"" Grande from 1970 to 1981. Though they separated not long after moving to Europe during the mid-1970s, they did not divorce until the early 1980s, after which Lange paid him an undisclosed sum in alimony.[61][62] From 1976 to 1982, she was partnered with renowned Russian ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she had her first child, Aleksandra Lange ""Shura"" Baryshnikov (born 1981).[63] During that time, she was also sporadically linked with Bob Fosse, with whom she remained friends until his death.  In 1982, she met and entered into a relationship with playwright Sam Shepard. They had two children: daughter Hannah Jane Shepard (born 1986) and son Samuel Walker Shepard (born 1987). They lived together in Virginia, New Mexico, Minnesota, and eventually New York City, before separating in 2009.[64][65][66]  Though she does not follow any set religion, she periodically practices Buddhism.[67] She once admitted, ""It's been a discipline that makes sense more than anything because it's like a science. I've never been a religious person. I've always looked for some kind of spiritual meaning. I didn't grow up going to church. My mother's family were atheists and my father's side was confused.""[67] She is also a vegetarian.[68]  Lange has also revealed that she suffers from severe bouts of depression,[15][69] once admitting, ""I have never been a believer in psychoanalysis or therapy or anything like that. I've never done that.""[69] She confessed, ""Though my dark side is dormant right now, it continues to play a big role in whatever capacity I have to be creative. That's the well I'm able to tap into, where all the anguish, rage and sadness are stored.""[15]  Photography [ edit ]  In 2008, Lange published her own collection of black-and-white pictures entitled 50 Photographs (powerHouse Books) with a special introduction by Patti Smith.[70] An exhibition of her work, along with a series of her films, was presented at the oldest international museum of photography and film, the George Eastman House, after which Lange was presented with the first George Eastman House Honors Award in 2009.[71] In 2010, she published a second collection of photographs, In Mexico.[72] Most recently, she released a children's picture book called It's About a Little Bird (2013), while for the first time in Russia, she exhibited in Moscow's Multimedia Art Museum in 2014.[73]  Humanitarian work and political views [ edit ]  Lange is a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), specializing in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in spreading awareness of the disease in Russia.[74][75]  She was also a public critic of former U.S. President George W.

This isn’t the first time she has taken to Twitter to suggest she will be dropping music in the near future. Eagle-eyed Barbz noticed on Sunday that the Anaconda singer tweeted the number four, before quickly deleting it.  She repeated this process on Monday, but with the number three, which sparked a frenzy of speculation that she was counting down to a potential release.  Her mysterious tweets come nearly five months since the Superbass singer was last active on social media save for a few promotional ads.  In these last few months, she appears to have been taking her time to create new music. Just last year, Minaj told Dazed magazine her next album would be “a billion times more epic than anything ‘Anaconda’ could have delivered.”  Whatever Nicki is cooking, we can’t wait to see. We’re counting down to the big release as well.  Source: E! News	0
"(CNN) Protesters rushed the stage after swimmer Ryan Lochte's first performance on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" interrupting the live show Monday evening. The incident occurred as Lochte was receiving one of the judge's critique of his dance routine.  ""Two individuals stormed the dance floor tonight and were immediately subdued and escorted out of the building,"" a spokesperson for the company that produces ""Dancing with the Stars,"" BBC Worldwide Productions, told CNN.  Lochte joined Season 23 of ""Dancing With The Stars"" after a spate of negative publicity he received for admitting he ""over-exaggerated"" claims that he and fellow swimmers were robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro  Although the show was live, the actual incident was not shown on camera by ABC.  At least one audience member was able to record the moment security guards tackled Soroudi and Sotoodeh and posted video to social media.

""Dancing with the Stars"" host Tom Bergeron addressed the interruption after the commercial break.  ""We had to go to break because we had a little incident,"" he said, although he didn't clarify any further. Bergeron thanked the security team on the show.  He also asked Lochte how he was doing after the interruption.  ""I'm a little hurt""  ""So many feelings are going through my head right now,"" said the Olympic swimmer. ""I'm a little hurt.""  After the show, Lochte told CNN that he was saddened by what happened.  ""You know, at that moment, I was really heartbroken,"" he said. ""My heart just sunk. It felt like somebody just ripped it apart.""  But Lochte added he ""had to brush it off.""  ""Completely shocked"" but ""beyond"" proud of him  ""I had to realize that I came out here in front of millions. I did something that I did not know how to do -- I don't know how to dance,"" he said. ""And I gave it my all and I'm glad I did it and I'm glad I'm here.""  His dancing partner, Burke, said she was ""completely shocked"" but ""beyond"" proud of him.  CNN crews captured two suspected protesters outside of the event being led away in handcuffs.

Professional dancer Witney Carson, who this year is paired with Robert Van Winkle, known best as Vanilla Ice, said she'd never seen anything like the incident during her time on the show.  ""I think it was just saddening and disheartening more than anything because this is such a positive show and we're all about putting people in a positive light,"" she said.

They've been together since 2015.  Are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton married? Ever since Gwen Stefani’s split from Tony Kanal in the 90s, we’ve always wanted her to find someone who could love her and have a healthy relationship. While we thought that was the case with Gavin Rossdale, he ended up breaking her heart and cheating on her after 14 years of marriage and three beautiful children later.  But in 2015, Stefani met Blake Shelton while filming The Voice, and the two have been dating ever since. He’s getting along well with her children and seems to treat her well.  A post shared by ExtraTV (@extratv) on Jul 30, 2018 at 9:00am PDT  Even though they’ve both said they aren’t rushing into marriage (since they each divorced their spouses not too long ago), are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton secretly married?  According to sources, the couple has been trying to conceive a child of their own. “Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold. Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being. Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys. Blake has always wanted children. And he’s great with Gwen’s kids, which prompted them wanting their own,” an insider said.  A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jun 28, 2018 at 4:35pm PDT  It looks like they are putting their plans to have children on hold — so does that mean they want to get married beforehand? Because Stefani is so traditional, getting pregnant without being married is unlikely. If that’s the case, did they have a quickie wedding to move things along?  Back in April, she confirmed to Ellen Degeneres she is not married.  Degeneres asked her questions about Shelton, to which Stefani replied, “It's weird because I get nervous when you talk to me about him. I don't know why, but for some reason, the cameras are rolling and I shouldn't say something. So if I say, 'We are [getting married],' then we are, and if I say, 'No, we're not,' then that would be sad, too.”  The good news, however, is that her children are taken with him. “We love him,” Stefani commented. “Everybody loves him. He's lovable. I think about [marriage] all the time.”  Even Shelton himself thinks about marrying Stefani. In an interview with CMT’s Cody Alan, Shelton admitted, “I think about it. I don’t think it’s anytime soon or anything. The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you’d be getting to that.”  As for a secret marriage, you can put the rumors to rest. This couple is taking things slow, but we may see Stefani walking down the aisle again in the near future.

Leonardo DiCaprio will star in and produce an adaptation of Stephan Talty’s book “The Black Hand” for Paramount Pictures.  The true story about the origins of the mafia in America follows Joe Petrosino — nicknamed the “Italian Sherlock Holmes” — an NYPD cop who goes after the ruthless gang in the early 190os. The thugs (with the calling card black hand) migrated from Italy to America, and kidnapped people to extort money from their families. They were loathed by law-abiding Italian families who were frightened, but nevertheless helped Petrosino behind the scenes.  Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Jeremy Bell of The Gotham Group will produce. DiCaprio’s producing partner, Jennifer Davisson, will also produce with Gotham, as well as Nathaniel Posey on behalf of his Appian Way Productions.  Talty is the New York Times-bestselling author of six nonfiction books focused on history and individual achievement. As a ghostwriter, Talty’s work includes “A Captain’s Duty,” which was the basis for the 2013 Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks-starrer “Captain Phillips.”  DiCaprio recently starred in “Before the Flood,” the 2016 documentary about climate change directed by Fisher Stevens. He will next play Sam Phillips, a pioneer in the music industry during the 1950s who helped launch the careers of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis.  Paramount has been busy acquiring material for DiCaprio following his new first-look deal, which he signed in 2015. Appain Way is developing a reboot of the “Captain Planet” series with Glen Powell, among its many projects.  DiCaprio is repped by LBI Entertainment. The news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.	1

"Ben Margot/Associated Press  Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night.  The league announced on Friday, via Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Thompson has been fined $25,000, while his flagrant-2 foul has been downgraded to a flagrant-1.  Thompson was ejected with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime of Golden State's 124-114 victory after the referee deemed he threw an elbow at Warriors guard Shaun Livingston. He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.  Instead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.  When asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):  That confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:  Thompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9"", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.  Although he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.  The on-court altercation could have led to the suspension of multiple Cavaliers. Like Thompson, Kevin Love also avoided a ban for his Game 1 actions. Love was not checked into the game at the time of the skirmish, but he found himself on the court at the time of the pushing and shoving, though he quickly made his way back to the sideline."	1
Most of us know about Angelina Jolie’s high-profile relationship with heartthrob ex-husband Brad Pitt. Unfortunately, after years of serving as Hollywood’s golden couple, Brangelina’s reign has come to an end. With so much attention being paid to Angie’s most recent beau, why not reflect on some of her past relationships? Some of which are likely to surprise you!  Jonny Lee Miller  Prior to Pitt, Angelina had actually been married twice. The first was to fellow actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met on the set of the 1996 film Hackers. The loved-up pair got hitched six months after shooting ended and ultimately divorced three years later, though they remain friends to this day.  Billy Bob Thornton  Those who recall it may associate Angelina and Billy Bob Thornton’s relationship with her darker, wild-child days. The eccentric couple got married in Vegas after two months of courtship, during which they became famous for their frequent PDA, 20-year age difference, and wearing vials of each other’s blood. Their marriage came to an end in 2003.  Val Kilmer  After starring alongside one another in the film Alexander Val Kilmer, rumors began swirling that Angelina had begun a romance with . The press was quick to point out that Kilmer, age 44 to her 29, was the second in a series of significantly older boyfriends in Angie’s life. Ultimately, the fling was kept private and brief.  Nicolas Cage  Considering the immense star power of both involved, you would think we would hear more about the rumored relationship between Angelina Jolie and Nicolas Cage. However, their short 2003 fling was kept so quiet that only a few sightings of them being romantic at parties were ever reported in the media.  Jenny Shimizu  For decades, Angelina Jolie has been open about her attraction to both men and women. However, only one woman has ever been known to steal the starlet’s heart: model and actress Jenny Shimizu. The pair met on the set of Foxfire, and according to Jolie, it was love at first sight.	1
The current editor in chief of Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, has a net worth of $35 million. In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.	1
"Flip or Flop is a television series airing on HGTV hosted by real estate agents and real-life husband and wife Tarek and Christina El Moussa,[1] and beginning with season 7, episode 6, the two continue working together although divorced. The show is the original show in the Flip or Flop franchise.  Premise [ edit ]  The El Moussas were both real estate agents prior to the crash in 2008, and later they began flipping homes, mostly in Orange County, California.  In 2011, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape was sent to HGTV, and they were interested in talking to the couple. In 2012, HGTV signed the couple to a regular weekly program that shows the process of buying distressed property and renovating it.[2]  Christina's expertise is primarily in design, and she works with Tarek to find and renovate homes. She handles the designs of the new spaces and keeps everything on schedule. The show follows them as they buy homes, typically bank-owned, short sales or foreclosures, to renovate and resell.[3]  Hosts [ edit ]  Personal life [ edit ]  Tarek El Moussa grew up in Buena Park, California and Christina Meursinge Haack grew up in Anaheim Hills. Tarek, who earned his real estate license at age 21, met Christina while working in the real estate industry.[4] The couple were selling real estate in the Southern California area[5] when the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash; they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment.[6]  The couple married in 2009 and have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.[7]  In 2013, a registered nurse and viewer, Ryan Reade, contacted the network after seeing a lump on Tarek's neck during a Flip or Flop marathon. Tarek had previously had the lump examined, and he said there was no issue. After Reade contacted producers, Tarek had the lump checked again; doctors discovered that he had stage 2 thyroid cancer.[8] The El Moussas thanked Reade in a video that can be seen on HGTV.com.[9]  In May 2016, the couple had secretly split due to ""challenges"" in their marriage.[10] In January 2017, Tarek officially filed for divorce from Christina.[11]  Real estate career [ edit ]  Tarek and Christina run a real-estate agency, The El Moussa Group, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country. Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[12]  Series overview [ edit ]  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 13 April 16, 2013 ( ) May 28, 2013 ( 2013-05-28 ) 2 14 April 8, 2014 ( ) July 8, 2014 ( 2014-07-08 ) 3 15 October 7, 2014 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 15 December 3, 2015 ( ) March 24, 2016 ( 2016-03-24 ) 5 15 June 9, 2016 ( ) September 22, 2016 ( 2016-09-22 ) 6 15 December 1, 2016 ( ) March 30, 2017 ( 2017-03-30 ) 7 8 June 15, 2017 ( ) July 20, 2017 ( 2017-07-20 ) 8 TBA May 31, 2018 ( ) TBA  References [ edit ]"	1
Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have blended their families seamlessly since they began dating in February, and over the Christmas holiday the power couple headed to Miami for a festive celebration.  The actress and singer, 48, shared a photo of herself posing with family and holding tight onto her 9-year-old daughter Emme on Christmas. Rodriguez, wearing pajamas along with the rest of the clan — including Lopez’s mom Guadalupe Rodríguez and sister Lynda — is cuddled up next to his girlfriend with Emme’s twin brother Max sandwiched in between.  “Hope everyone had a peaceful Christmas full of joy and laughter, surrounded by all your loved ones… sending everyone lots of love and good wishes for this holiday season!!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS,” wrote Lopez, who co-parents her twins with ex-husband Marc Anthony.  Lynda Lopez/Instagram  Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez and Family Jennifer Lopez/Instagram  The Shades of Blue star also gave fans a peek at their holiday feast decor in a video she posted showing A-Rod — who’s dad to Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9 (with ex Cynthia Scurtis) lounging in the pool.  “So this is what Christmas Eve in Miami’s like, huh?” she asks the retired baseball star in the video.  “Hot!” replies the athlete-turned entrepreneur, 42, as Lopez pans around the home’s yard to show off the sunny weather.  Rodriguez also shared his own festive photos on Instagram, posting a cute photo (taken by Lynda) of the couple lounging next to their Christmas tree.  He also showed off a selfie of Lopez — who appears to be makeup-free — and joked about being “blocked” in the photo.  “So much for my attempted photobomb,” he captioned the photo, adding the hashtags #HiMyName IsAlex and #TrustMeIAmBackThere.  Earlier this month, sources close to the couple told PEOPLE exclusively the duo are planning a long-term future together.  “All the kids want Jennifer and Alex to get married,” a Lopez source told PEOPLE exclusively. “There are definitely talks about getting married, but Jennifer is old-school and will wait for the engagement ring before she entertains any wedding talk.”	1
Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”Article continues below Get a weekly round-up of the most essential Elon Musk news sent to your inbox. Sign up for our newsletter: sign upAs Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.	1
"CLOSE Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan magazine from the checkout aisle after concerns were raised about the content. Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more. Buzz60  Cosmopolitan (Photo: Cosmopolitan)  Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan to a less uptown locale.  The retail giant will remove the women's fashion magazine from checkout lines at 5,000 stores across the country.  In a statement shared with USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson Meggan Kring said: “As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes. Walmart will continue to offer Cosmopolitan to customers that wish to purchase the magazine, but it will no longer be located in the checkout aisles. While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard.”  The news was shared Tuesday via a press release from National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an organization that says it helped instigate the policy change.  ""You can go through and buy your groceries with your family knowing you don't have to be exposed to this graphic and often degrading and offensive material,"" NCOSE Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Haley Halverson said in a Facebook live session Tuesday. ""Instead, all of these magazines will be moved, in isolation, to the magazine racks.""  A Cosmopolitan spokesperson told the Associated Press Wednesday that the magazine is ""proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world.""  Cosmo began running frank content about sex under the direction of editor Helen Gurley Brown in 1965. Brown transformed the once family-oriented magazine into a publication for single women that — along with topics on relationships, beauty, fashion and health — still publishes advice and discussions on sex.  The NCOSE, which changed its name from Morality in Media in 2015, has been working to cover or remove Cosmo from store shelves for years, deeming it porn. In 2015, the group was behind a successful push to place the magazine behind blinders in stores owned by Rite Aid and Delhaize America (which owns Hannaford Stores and Food Lion).  The organization has also been a strong Playboy opposer. Patrick Trueman, president of NCOSE, called Hugh Hefner ""a pioneer in the sexual objectification and use of women"" following his death in September, saying the Playboy founder left behind ""a legacy of sexual exploitation and public health harms.""  The Walton family, heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton, have traditionally donated more to Republicans, and have had a conservative reputation, though the company dropped out of conservative advocacy group American Legislative Council in 2012.  Walmart's decision comes amid the Me Too movement and a national reckoning on sexual harassment, according to Halverson.  ""This is one less drop of hyper-sexualized media that is going to be bombarding people in their everyday lives, which does make a difference, especially in this Me Too culture that we're living in, where we really want a culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood,"" Halverson said.  The Me Too movement, however, has focused on sexual harassment and assault rather than pornography. It gained momentum in October as bombshell reports from The New York Times and The New Yorkerdetailed decades of alleged sexual harassment and assault by producer Harvey Weinstein. Allegations against dozens of men in positions of power emerged in following weeks, and celebrities and non-celebrities alike flooded social media platforms with the hashtag #MeToo with their own stories of harassment, highlighting the depth of the problem.  USA TODAY's exclusive industry-wide survey revealed 94% of women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault over the course of their careers in the entertainment industry.  In a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday, Halverson says NCOSE hopes other major retailers follow Walmart's example.  ""We are not expressly calling for any boycotts, but we are asking Target and Walgreens to follow Walmart's example and also remove Cosmo from their checkout aisles,"" she wrote.  The Cosmo ban has caused debate on social media, with some praising Walmart's decision and others saying the company missed the point of the Me Too movement.

After three years of ups and downs, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon are finally officially together — and sharing all the details of their emotional love story.  The giddy couple recently sat down together to film a tear-filled episode of Iaconetti’s show The Story of Us (shared exclusively with PEOPLE) to open up about their journey, which began three summers ago on Bachelor in Paradise.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Bachelor Nation hasn’t seen so many of the important details that make up our story. I thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of The Story of Us,” Iaconetti, 30, tells PEOPLE exclusively.  Adds Haibon, 29: “Our close friends have watched our relationship evolve and understand how we’ve gotten to this point. But people who haven’t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us ‘Wait, how did this happen?’ With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying ‘I’m an idiot.'”  Love at First Sight  While all Paradise fans know Iaconetti has been enamored with her boyfriend since she first laid eyes on him in 2015, what they might not know is that Haibon also immediately felt a deep connection to her pretty early on.  Admitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently “staring” at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon — who thought she was “really hot” — only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico.  “I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along … how the conversation just flowed,” he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch‘s Kinetic Content). “It never felt dull … or awkward.”  Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti  It was “truly love at first sight” for Iaconetti, however, who wasn’t able to fully be herself during the experience. “My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,” explains Iaconetti. “I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.”  Though Haibon “dumped” Iaconetti on the show, “I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,” he says. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.”  Flirty Friendship  After their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship — but also became the definition of “it’s complicated.”  During a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. “I was in love,” he says. “That was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.”  Adds Iaconetti: “I knew that he was looking at me!”  Though they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were “flirty” with each other, the timing just wasn’t right.

The duo met up in Boston at one point and “we made out real hard,” says Iaconetti. But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse.  After going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti’s home. “You, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,” she recalls. “This is when I knew something was wrong. And I don’t know what was wrong still.”  Looking back now, Haibon says he just wasn’t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. “Of course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that’s so unfair for me to be halfway in,” he says.  Paradise Part 2  With their mutual friends urging Iaconetti to move on from Haibon, the duo agreed to see other people for their second go on Paradise in 2016.  But Iaconetti “came in like a roller coaster,” recalls Haibon. “I’ll never forget that. It was really difficult … I was trying to tell you we weren’t gonna be together because I wanted you to move on [and] be happy.”  The drama continued after Mexico, and “we had so many arguments that summer when it was airing,” says Iaconetti. Those many fights helped them build a stronger bond, however, and “that kicked off a solid year of just friendship.”  Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti  Eventually, however, Haibon went into a “dark hole” and became “really withdrawn [and] almost resentful and angry,” says a tearful Iaconetti, who even had a “daybed” for Haibon when he would visit her in L.A.  Explains Haibon: “I think sometimes you imagine like you’re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I’m like going after this other girl and we’re going on dates, and yet it’s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date … there’s no going back. Even if I had a two percent doubt about our relationship, then I probably shouldn’t do it because I don’t want to risk losing you as a friend.”  Jared Professes His Love  Haibon eventually signed up to do Bachelor in Paradise Australia while Iaconetti gave love another shot on Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt.  “I remember I was on a date with a girl in Paradise … and I was just sitting there and thinking, ‘God, I wish Ashley were here,'” recalls Haibon. “I just wanna hang out with Ashley.”  When he returned from Australia, the duo exchanged a few flirty texts, but then Iaconetti jetted off to Winter Games in late 2017.  “I remember I heard rumors that you might have met somebody, and I was sad,” says Haibon. “Sometimes I need a kick in the ass. That was a big kick in the ass.”  Over the holidays, the duo exchanged awkward pleasantries before heading to a formerly planned vacation to St. Lucia with her sister Lauren and Bachelor alums Tanner Tolbert and Jade Roper in January.  RELATED: The Bachelor’s Ashley Iaconetti on Kevin Wendt Split: He ‘Just Wasn’t My Forever Guy’  “Going into St. Lucia, I did a lot of self-reflection … trying to figure out what I want, what I should do, if I should do anything,” he says about weighing whether or not to tell Iaconetti about his feelings for her. “It’s so unfair for me to say anything. Ashley goes on a show, finds another guy and now I’m gonna say something? What kind of assh— does that?”  After opening up to their “fairy godfather” Tolbert, however, Haibon decided to come clean to Iaconetti. “Tanner loves the theatrics of everything,” says Haibon. “But he said something that really resonated with me. Tanner said ‘It’s more unfair to Ashley if you don’t say anything because you need to give her the opportunity to let her know how you feel and let her make up her own mind.’ I was like ‘Okay!'”  Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti  The morning before the group flew back to the States, Haibon finally opened up to Iaconetti about his feelings for her. “I left that conversation with him not just admitting that he was jealous but also he had feelings, and you kind of alluded to wanting to be with me,” says Iaconetti.  “I remember you said ‘I’m gonna keep dating [Kevin],'” says Haibon. “I knew that in the coming months, I would have to really show Ashley that I was very serious about this.”  He also took a page right out of a romantic comedy and planted a kiss on Iaconetti just as she was about to board her flight. “I remember thinking ‘I should really kiss her.’ I was scared to do it. Tanner was like ‘You should go kiss her,’ and I was like ‘Yup!'”  But even after sharing a romantic smooch at the airport, Iaconetti wanted to give her relationship with Wendt a fair shot. “I thought ‘Okay, well that’s everything I’ve ever wanted, but I’m definitely gonna continue dating this other guy,'” she says. “I do like him. He’s pursued me … he’s been all in the entire time and I deserve to pursue somebody else and for somebody else to pursue me after all this time.”  As Winter Games was airing, however, Iaconetti knew her relationship with Wendt was over. “I just knew in my heart at that point that it wasn’t right with Kevin. I ended the relationship because it had run its course, and then Jared was still there,” she says, adding that she didn’t cheat on her ex.  Their Fairy-Tale Ending  After Iaconetti and Wendt split in March, Haibon went all out to win over Iaconetti and poured his heart into an emotional love letter that took three days to write. “I was scream-crying basically alone in my apartment reading that just sobbing and sobbing,” says Iaconetti.  Since then, the couple have been going strong — and Haibon continues to woo his girlfriend.  Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Kinetic Content  “He’s written me other letters and filled my apartment with flowers. He tells me every day that he’s the luckiest man alive,” she says.  Adds Haibon: “I’m living proof that you should listen to your gut, and that it’s not too late. The person I wanted to be with most was right in front of my eyes.”  The Story of Us: Ashley I & Jared was executive produced by Chris Coelen, Paria Sadighi, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon.	0
They have been teasing a hotly-anticipated reunion since the beginning of the year.  However it seems the Spice Girls may have dashed the fans hopes of a reunion yet again due to claims that Victoria Beckham has allegedly refused to tour.  The iconic pop band's reunion tour is believed to have been called off following rifts between Posh and Melanie C, Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton, reports the Sun.  It's all off! The Spice Girls may have dashed the fans hopes of a reunion yet again due to claims that Victoria Beckham has allegedly refused to tour  While Victoria has always insisted that she would never tour with the band again, the girls thought their original manager Simon Fuller would convince her, an insider told the website.  The women were set to make £30million each following the tour which was due to begin in late September after manager Simon masterminded the comeback.  MailOnline has contacted a representative for Victoria for comment.  The insider claimed that the band was in 'disarray' following 'heated debates between the girls and Victoria'.  Refusal: While Victoria has always insisted that she would never tour with the band again, the girls thought their original manager Simon Fuller would convince her, an insider told the website  The source said: 'Simon was brought in to convince her to take the offer but now he's failed they feel he's used them to put his name back on the map.'  It is claimed that the other girls approached Victoria last week and gave her an ultimatum between them and Simon.  However it is believed that she chose their manager, who managed to turn her brand into an empire.  Back in the day: The iconic pop band's reunion tour is believed to have been called off following rifts between Posh and Melanie C, Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton, reports the Sun  The cause of this latest chapter in the reunion saga is apparently to do with money, with a source stating that Mel B and Mel C are wanting to 'cash in'.  Despite her solo success Mel B's recent account history shows that her company Red Girl Records is £808,568 in debt with her Red Girl Touring Ltd suffering losses of £77,956 last year.  Her financial situation was laid bare in the courts last year as it was revealed her multi-million fortune had been wiped out due to her 'extravagant' lifestyle.  And in another shocking twist to the Mel B and Stephen Belafonte divorce battle, it was claimed the Spice Girls star has just £961 left in one of her company accounts.  Lucrative: The women were set to make £30million each following the tour which was due to begin in late September after manager Simon masterminded the comeback  Accounts filed for Victoria's luxury label, which sells high-end dresses and accessories, saw losses almost double to £8.5 million last year - up from £4.3million in 2015.  Meanwhile husband David's company DB Ventures, which handles the former footballer's endorsement deals, reported a profit of £24.9million after tax in 2016. This is the equivalent to roughly £2million a month.  Sales at VBL remained stable over the year however losses grew on the back of increased investment in the fashion brand's design, marketing and sales.  Earlier this year the former pop star's fashion business was valued at £100million following a major cash injection from former Goldman Sachs banker David Belhassen, the man behind French-inspired bakery chain Paul.  Decision time! It is claimed that the other girls approached Victoria last week and gave her an ultimatum between them and Simon  The Beckham's have recently been forced to shoot down rumours of an impending divorce.  After rumors of an impending split began racing around social media on Friday, Jo Milloy, a spokesman for Spice Girl-turned-designer Victoria, told the Daily Mail that the gossip was ‘absolute nonsense’.  Meanwhile former England football captain’s spokesman, Simon Oliveira, likewise dubbed the claims ‘embarrassing and laughable’.  Elsewhere, a spokesman for the couple was quoted as saying: ‘There is no statement due, no divorce, and a lot of Chinese whispers and fake social media news. This is all very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time.’ The rumours were ‘a crock of s***’, he said.	1
Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.	1

"Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter.  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  The president and first lady attended a state dinner at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England, on Thursday, and Melania Trump's formal dress left her looking like a picture-perfect princess — but not the British royal variety.  Trump's floor-length, pleated J.Mendel cape gown was giving off pure Disney princess vibes.  Melania Trump wore a pale yellow J.Mendel cape gown for her visit to Blenheim Palace. AFP /Getty Images  According to fashion-loving first-family watchers on social media, the candlelight-yellow silk chiffon design would have looked just as fitting in a fictional castle as it did in that 18th century palace, since it seemed to channel Belle from ""Beauty and the Beast.""  Emma Watson wowed in yellow gown as Belle in 2017's ""Beauty and The Beast."" Disney  But the elegant gown wasn't intended to honor Belle. Instead it was a nod to Queen Elizabeth II.  Though the monarch didn't attend the dinner, according to WWD, Trump's stylist, Herve Pierre, said the pale yellow shade was selected to ""pay homage"" to the queen, as it's known to be a favorite of hers.  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump leave the U.S. ambassador's residence, Winfield House, on their way to Blenheim Palace for dinner with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and business leaders, in London, July 12, 2018. Reuters  The design is part of J. Mendel's 2018 spring collection, but only the first lady gets this version. For the public, it's only available in emerald (or it was, until it sold out).  On Friday, Trump will come face-to-face with the queen at for tea at Windsor Castle, and while fashion fans will have to wait to see what she wears for that occasion, she already showed off another sold-out dress Friday morning.

Tavis Smiley speaks at a conference in New York in 2014. (Mark Lennihan/AP)  Talk-show host Tavis Smiley sued PBS on Tuesday, alleging that the network breached its contract and damaged his production company when it fired him in December over sexual-harassment allegations.  Smiley has been outspoken in his denials of PBS’s accusations. And so far, he appears to be the first of the many prominent media figures accused of sexual misconduct to take his counterclaim to court.  The public television network, based in Arlington, Va., dropped Smiley’s late-night interview program, “Tavis Smiley,” in December over what it said were “multiple, credible allegations” of workplace misconduct by the host. It did not spell out the accusations, but news reports said Smiley allegedly had sexual relationships with employees of his company, TS Media, and that some feared their jobs were in jeopardy if they refused.  Smiley has repeatedly said PBS never presented him with the names of his accusers, specific allegations, or details of an investigation into his workplace relationships that led up to his dismissal. He has vigorously defended himself in media interviews, and even staged a five-city tour last month in which he led panel discussions about workplace harassment.  “I’ve spent the bulk of my career in public media, so filing a lawsuit against PBS was the last thing I wanted to do,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “But litigation seems to be the only way to get at the truth.”  In a statement, Jennifer Rankin Byrne, PBS’s vice president for corporate communications, called the lawsuit “meritless” and an attempt by Smiley “to distract the public from his pattern of sexual misconduct in the workplace.”  PBS, she wrote, took action against Smiley after a complaint prompted the network to hire an independent law firm to conduct an investigation, which included a “lengthy interview with Mr. Smiley.” The investigation “revealed that he had multiple sexual encounters with subordinates over many years and yielded credible allegations of additional misconduct inconsistent with the values and standards of PBS.”  PBS had distributed “Tavis Smiley” for 14 years. It signed a new contract with Smiley’s Los Angeles-based production company in November, coincidentally just as the “Me Too” movement against workplace harassment was beginning to crest.  Smiley has acknowledged that he had romantic relationships with colleagues over his 30-year career as a speaker, TV host and author, but that these were always consensual. In his suit, filed in D.C.’s Superior Court, he claims that PBS used “trumped up” accusations to drop distribution of his program after years of infighting over the program’s funding, promotion and content.  His suit also asserts that some of the “tension” between PBS and Smiley, who is African American, was racial in nature.  PBS “has presented complaints and hassled Mr. Smiley when he had African American guests who espoused controversial positions, and effectively tried to stop any such guests from appearing,” his complaint says. “By contrast, PBS never raised editorial issues or hassled Mr. Smiley when he had white guests who espoused equally controversial positions (if not even more controversial).”  The suit didn’t specify a request for damages but said his company has lost “multiple millions of dollars” as result of his termination, and has laid off about 20 employees.  Smiley was one of several public-broadcasting figures who’ve been forced out by harassment complaints. Others include talk host Charlie Rose, NPR news chief Michael Oreskes and “Prairie Home Companion” creator Garrison Keillor.	0

Megastar Beyoncé is privately trapped in a nightmare marriage!  The 35-year-old singer and hip-hop mogul husband Jay-Z have secretly split twice and were “literally signatures away from a divorce” together, sources told The National ENQUIRER.  Now, with any ugly love child scandal and endless cheating allegations surrounding Jay-Z, a billion-dollar split appears more likely, insiders said.  Beyoncé put the spotlight on her eight-year troubled marriage in a promotional clip for her blockbuster 2016 album, “Lemonade.” Swinging a baseball bat, Beyoncé called out her tycoon husband for multiple affairs. The video even ended with Bey flinging her wedding ring to the ground!  Beyonce Gives Birth To Twins With Jay Z  As The ENQUIRER has reported, their marriage has been rocked by a notorious paternity scandal involving a New Jersey man, Rymir Satterthwaite, claiming he is Jay-Z’s love child.  The couple also relocated from the Big Apple to a pricey Beverly Hills spread in a bid to shore up their rocky union.  “Bey and Jay are two flawed people who make everyone believe they’re perfect,” spilled a source. “But they are a bad storm and you’d best believe there aren’t any blue skies hovering over them.”	1

Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)  Rumors of a feud between Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey have existed in Internet lore for years. And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it’s the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.  So here’s how the whole thing went down.  The Beginnings  In the early ‘00s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyoncé “nice” and “a good writer” and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. “I don’t know her,” Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.  If you’ve not seen the GIF, you’ve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.  The Aftermath  It is years later; “I don’t know her” has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey’s mouth since “all I want for Christmas is you.” It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.    “I know from back in the day, I’ve read things that she’s said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,” Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. “Like, we don’t know each other. I think it’s kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I’m not really aware of.”    Then, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the “Lambs.”  Recently? I don’t know. [yawns] I’m sorry, I’m having a “sleep” moment…    Well, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn’t trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody’s kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it — and I’m going to leave you hanging as to what it was.  To recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was “just being honest.” The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn’t really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.  Round Two  Talk of the feud picked up after last year’s Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey’s performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez’s visual response to Carey’s “I don’t know her” GIF.  Which Brings Us to This Week…  Jennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects — Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. — she’s currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.  “First of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it — it was a long performance,“ Lopez said, in what is not not shade. “I watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, ‘Look at her! Look at her!’”  Lopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey’s show didn’t start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.  “Who?” the talk show host joked of Carey. “No, I’m playing because that’s what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.”    “She does say that,” Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. “She’s forgetful I guess.”	1

You’re like, a waste of space in my meter right now.”    “You’re annoying as f— now when we’re together,” she adds. “This is what you do. You’re on your phone the whole time. You’re just not present!”    “We’re only here once,” says Khloé. “When are we ever going to go back to Alcatraz? You know what? Actually, I’m not doing this today. I’m not doing this today, because last time in Costa Rica, I looked crazy because I’m always the one complaining to get you guys to have fun. I’m not going to be crazy, okay? You’ll be the f—ing bitch that you need to be.”    “Good. F— you, you f—ing whore,” Kourtney retorts, adding, “Pregnant wh***!”  This article originally appeared on New Idea.	1

It even happens to Beyonce.  The challenge with high-tech concert production is, like all machinery, sometimes it malfunctions. And Saturday night, at the Warsaw stop of Jay-Z and Beyonce’s “On the Run II” tour, a flying stage that ordinarily enables the singer to hover over the grown got stuck 20 feet in the air, forcing a rather undignified exit.  Stage techs were forced to go old-school to bring Beyonce back down to earth via an ordinary ladder. The band vamped while Beyonce initially appeared reluctant to descend via the ladder — understandable considering her towering heels — but eventually capitulated.  In a fan video (h/t Daily Beast), fans can be heard chanting the singer’s name while one yells in a thick Polish accent, “You can do it!” The fan who posted the video wrote: “Beyoncé’s flying stage got broken at the end of the show in Warsaw and she had to walk down on a ladder. She also gave us a little cute dance!”  The tour kicked off June 6 in Cardiff, UK, and covers 15 cities across the UK and Europe, with the 21-date North American leg beginning July 25 in Cleveland.

"Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress, film producer, and businesswoman. She is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood—as of 2017 , her net worth is estimated at $200 million—and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012. She has also been included on magazine lists of the world's most beautiful women.  The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began her career at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me. Aniston rose to fame portraying Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), for which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards. The character was widely popular while the series aired and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television. Aniston has since played lead roles in numerous comedies and romantic comedies. Her box office hits include Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We're the Millers (2013), each of which grossed over $200 million in worldwide receipts. Her most critically acclaimed roles were in Office Space (1999); The Good Girl (2002), for which she was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award; Friends with Money (2006); and the drama Cake (2014), for which she received nominations for the Golden Globe, Critics' Choice and SAG awards.  Aniston co-founded production company Echo Films in 2008. Divorced from actor Brad Pitt, to whom she was married for five years, she is separated from actor Justin Theroux, who she married in 2015.  Early life  Aniston was born on February 11, 1969 in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks,[1][2] the daughter of Greek-born actor John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow.[1] One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louise Grieco, was an Arbëreshë immigrant.[3][4] Her mother's other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek.[5] Aniston has two half-brothers, John Melick, her older maternal half-brother, and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother.[1] Aniston's godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father's best friends.[1][6]  As a child she moved to New York City.[1] Despite her father's television career she was discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school.[7] Her parents split up when she was nine years old.[8]  Having discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school,[8] Aniston enrolled in Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society.[9] Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.[10] She was in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.[11]  Career  Beginnings (1988–1993)  Aniston first worked in Off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker's Grave,[1] and supported herself with part-time jobs which included working as a telemarketer, waitress, and bike messenger.[1] In 1988, she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem,[12] and moved back to Los Angeles.[13]  She obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990, and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993).[14] A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role,[15] and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.[16]  Aniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series, The Edge and Muddling Through,[17] and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head, and Burke's Law.[18][19]  Friends (1994–2004)  Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for Friends,[20][17] a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producer originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[21] but Courteney Cox was considered more suitable. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down to do Friends.[22] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004.  The program was successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers. Her character was widely popular and was later recognized as one of the greatest female characters in American television.[23][24] The actress received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress.[25] She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness World Book of Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends.[26] Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple were frequently voted as television's favorite couple in polls and magazines.[27]  Following a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She's the One.[28] Aniston's first starring vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), in which she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success,[29] and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.[30] In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection,[31] and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space.[32]  She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America.[33] Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough:  Sfter languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.[34]  Aniston's biggest commercial success to date is the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God himself for one week.[35] With a worldwide box office gross of $484 million,[36][37] the film was the fifth-highest-grossing big screen production of the year.[38] Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly-wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004), opposite Ben Stiller,[39] which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million in its opening weekend;[40] it eventually made $172 million globally.[41]  Continued film success (2005–2013)  In 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller Derailed, and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy Rumor Has It.[42][43] Both films were moderate box office hits.[44][45] Aniston took on the role of a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in the independent drama Friends with Money (2006), which received a limited release.[46]  Her next film was the romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006), alongside Vince Vaughn, in which she starred as one half of a couple having a complicated split when both refuse to move out of the pair's recently purchased home. It received mixed reviews but grossed approximately $39.17 million during its opening weekend and $204 million worldwide.[47] The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the film a negative review, stating, ""It's like watching the 'we were on a break' episode of Friends stretched to feature length, and without the blessed relief of commercial breaks or the promise of Seinfeld around the corner.""[48] CinemaBlend gave the film a positive review stating, ""In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.""[49]  In 2006, Aniston directed the short film Room 10, set in a hospital emergency room and starring Robin Wright and Kris Kristofferson, as part of Glamour's Reel Moments film series.[50] She noted that she was inspired to direct by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also directed a short film that year.[51] In 2007, Aniston guest-starred in an episode of Dirt—playing the rival of Courteney Cox's character[52]—and in an episode of 30 Rock, playing a woman who stalks Jack Donaghy.[53] For the latter she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[54]  The 2005 comedy drama Marley & Me, with Aniston and Owen Wilson as the owners of the titular dog, set a record for the largest Christmas Day box office sales ever with $14.75 million. It earned a total of $51.7 million over the four-day weekend and placed number one at the box office, a position it maintained for two weeks.[55] The total worldwide gross was $242.7 million.[56] Her next film in wide release, the romantic comedy He's Just Not That Into You (2009), in which she starred opposite Ben Affleck, grossed $178.8 million globally[57] and ranked number one at the United States box office for its opening weekend.[58] While it received mixed reviews, Aniston, along with Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly, were praised by critics as stand-outs in the film.[59][60]  Aniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter (Gerard Butler) in the romantic comedy action film The Bounty Hunter (2010). The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that ""the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.""[61] Nevertheless it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide.[62] A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film's opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed ""a dispiriting $8.4 million.""[63] The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.[64]  In 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC's sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist.[65] Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, ""[her role is] is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.""[66][67][68]  In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[69][70][71] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses.[72] Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[73][74]  Aniston appeared in the comedy Wanderlust (2012) with Paul Rudd,[75] with whom she acted in The Object of My Affection and also Friends, as a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them.[76] The script for Wanderlust, bought by Universal Pictures,[77] was produced by Judd Apatow.[78][79] Wanderlust received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.[80] Aniston starred as a struggling stripper who agrees to pose as a wife for a drug deal, with Jason Sudeikis, in We're the Millers (2013). The film received mixed reviews from critics,[81] but was a financial success, grossing $269 million against a budget of $37 million.[82]  Recent roles (2014–present)  Aniston played the role of a stoic socialite who becomes the target of an ill-planned kidnapping plot in Life of Crime (2014), a film adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1978 novel The Switch.[83] The film was released in limited theaters, to positive reviews.[84] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian described her performance as ""endearingly comic""[85] and Eric Kohn of Indie Wire wrote that ""Aniston tops any of her recent performances with a spirited turn that harkens back to her neurotic days on Friends.""[86] She also reprised her role for Horrible Bosses 2 (2014).[87]  In Cake (2014), Aniston starred as an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain.[88] The film received mixed reviews; however, Aniston's performance was highly praised, dubbed by some critics as ""Oscar-worthy.""[89][90][91][92] The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance ""heartbreakingly good"",[93] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix stated, ""It's really on most people's radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn't disappoint."" He further stated, ""Aniston makes you believe in Claire's pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. ... It's a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.""[94] For her portrayal, Aniston was nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[95][96]  Horrible Bosses in 2011.

Wesley Morris of Grantland called her ""one of the great screen comedians. ... Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. ... This isn't just Aniston having the best stuff. It's her having the most fun with her talent. She's funny in every way.""[98] She was ""one of the film's few bright spots"" for Lou Lumenick from The New York Post.[99]  Aniston starred as the recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy Mother's Day (2016), and opposite Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson.[100] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[101] In 2016, she voiced a workaholic and overprotective mother in the animated film Storks, alongside Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer,[102] which was released to mostly positive reviews, while it grossed over $183.4 million with a $70 million budget.[103][104] Her last 2016 film role was that of a frigidly cold head honcho of a company in the comedy Office Christmas Party, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck and opposite Jason Bateman and Kate McKinnon.[105] It made $114.5 million globally.[106]  In The Yellow Birds, a war drama directed by Alexandre Moors, Aniston portrayed the mother of a deceased soldier, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan, Jack Huston, and Toni Collette.[107] While she said she does not ""normally gravitate toward being in war films"", she made an exception because the film was ""written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced"".[108] The film, first presented during the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018.[109] The Los Angeles Times wrote in its review: ""Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances"".[110]  In December 2018, Netflix released the musical comedy Dumplin', with Aniston as executive producer and star—marking her first project for a streaming service.[111] That year her first original Netflix projects were also announced: Murder Mystery, a mystery comedy that reunites her with Adam Sandler,[112] and First Ladies, a film about the first lesbian President of the United States, with Tig Notaro as her wife.[113] Aniston and Reese Witherspoon will star in the morning show drama series Top of the Morning for Apple.

It was just like, sometimes things [happen].""[161]  In 2005, amid reports that their divorce was due to Aniston's refusal to have children with Pitt, Aniston stated to Vanity Fair, ""I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children.

Aniston also revealed that the divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, from whom she was estranged for nearly a decade. They initially became estranged when Nancy talked about her daughter on a television show and wrote From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999).[171][172] Aniston has also stated she was devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whose work helped make her separation from Pitt easier.[51] She said her relationship with Pitt, which she does not regret, was ""seven very intense years together"" and that ""it was a beautiful, complicated relationship"".[173]  Aniston started a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter Justin Theroux in May 2011. The next January they purchased a home in Los Angeles's Bel Air neighborhood for roughly $22 million.[174] They became engaged on August 10, 2012[175] and were married on August 5, 2015 at their estate.[176] They separated at the end of 2017.[177]  In the media  Wealth  Aniston is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.[178][179] She has been on the Forbes Top Earning Actresses for 15 years, every year since 2001—and since that time also on its Celebrity 100 list (based on ""earnings and fame""), topping it in 2003.[180][181] According to Forbes, in October 2007, Aniston was the top-selling celebrity face of the entertainment industry.[182]  The magazine estimated her net worth at $110 million in 2007,[183] $150 million in 2014,[184] and $200 million in 2017.[185] It has listed her earnings as $27 million in 2008,[186] $31 million in 2014,[187] $16.5 million in 2015,[188] $21 million in 2016,[189] and $25.5 million in 2017.[190]  Public image  Aniston has been included in magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women.[191][192][193] In 2005, she became the first GQ Woman of the Year.

Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Nazis,” they incite hatred and violence in those prone to carry out such extremist beliefs. If conservatives are indeed Nazis, progressives have a moral obligation to not only oppose them but physically stop them.However, conservatives are not Nazis. In fact, the right has consistently stood up for the liberties of all, including far-leftists, to express their beliefs in a peaceful and unhindered manner. Such is the opposite of Nazism. In fact, it is those screaming “Nazi!” who are acting as the new Third Reich, shouting ideological chants, forcing out those with whom they disagree, discriminating against certain demographics, attempting to take away our Constitutional rights, and inciting physical violence.Stephanie Wilkinson is getting exactly what she has demanded — a backlash from the political opposition. Turnabout is fair play. While conservatives aren’t going to wield the government as a weapon to force intolerant ideologues like her to serve those they don’t want to serve, as the left does, they’re learning that injecting their political views into their non-political professions might not be the best business decision.	1
Meghan Markle appeared close to tears during a moving Anzac Day dawn service where fiance Prince Harry honoured New Zealand and Australia's war dead.  During the poignant event staged as the sun's rays broke over the London skyline, Ms Markle looked emotional as the hymn Abide With Me was sung by thousands gathered at the New Zealand war memorial.  The US actress, who wore a grey coat and large brimmed hat, passed a cultural milestone when she, and Harry, were given a traditional Maori welcome.  The couple were welcomed by Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana - the London Maori Club - with a traditional hongi, the soft pressing of noses and the sharing of each other's breath.  Ms Markle was making her first appearance at a service marking Anzac Day - April 25 - the anniversary of the start of the First World War Gallipoli landings, and a national day of remembrance for Australia and New Zealand.	0
"Hello and good day! You may have heard rumours, reports, and speculation that 25-year-old Selena Gomez is dating 46-year-old Justin Theroux. Yep, the universal reaction seems to pretty much be:  What's up with Selena and Other Justin™'s relationship? It's not 100 per cent clear, so let's break down what we do know.  Justin Is Friends with Selena's BFF Petra Collins  ...Which could be how they've gotten to know each other. And actually, there were rumours that Petra and Justin dated after his split from Jennifer Aniston. Petra and Justin were recently spotted attending a pre-Met Gala party together, so, like, they're definitely hanging out.  ""Sources"" Say Justin Started Texting Sel After His Split from Jennifer  Apparently, ~sources~ from tabloids—which we're only referencing here in the interest of covering all the bases about how these rumours cropped up in the first place—claim Justin started texting Selena after their respective breakups: ""It was kind of an open secret that Justin was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her.""  Justin and Selena hanging with Paul Rudd in 2015.  Meanwhile, another tabloid got super excited about a rumour that the pair were supporting each other in the aftermath of their respective splits: ""Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups. It's turned into something more than friendship.""  ""Sources"" Say Jennifer Aniston Is Unhappy with the Rumours  Other ~sources~ (again, courtesy of a tabloid, so take this with a grain of salt) claim that Jennifer is ""upset"" over the rumours about Selena and Justin. The ""source"" said, ""To think of him with anyone else, especially someone so young and that Jen has a personal relationship with like Selena, is painful for her. Jen doesn't want to think about it and definitely does not believe it.""  And Finally, Everyone Should Probably Keep in Mind That Selena and Jennifer Are Close Friends"	1
When you get the chance to make a Star Wars film and have been a fan of the saga your whole life, it's hard to pass up an opportunity to appear on screen . The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson might not have appeared in his film in an immediately recognizable capacity, but confirmed on the film's commentary track that he grasps Han Solo's golden dice from the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in a close-up shot.  After clashing with Rey on Ahch-To, Luke Skywalker boards the Falcon in an emotional scene, reflecting on his former ally Han Solo having been killed by Kylo Ren. Upon discovering the dice, Luke takes them from where they hung on the ship and pockets them, ultimately handing them over to his sister Leia in the film's final act.  Actor Mark Hamill filmed a majority of this scene, yet Johnson couldn't help but take advantage of the opportunity to lend his own talents to the film by sporting a glove to clutch the dice in the quick shot.  This is Johnson's second appearance in the Star Wars saga, as he was also a Death Star gunner in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The filmmaker returned the favor to Rogue One director Gareth Edwards, who made an appearance as a Resistance trooper during the battle of Crait .  Johnson managed to sneak in quite a few cameos in The Last Jedi, with some being more obvious than others. Actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Noah Segan, who have appeared in all of Johnson's films, both made brief appearances, with Gordon-Levitt lending just his voice to an alien character while Segan played a Resistance pilot.  Tom Hardy, Take That singer Gary Barlow, and Princes Harry and William all shared a scene together where they played Stormtroopers, yet the scene was reportedly absent from the final cut.  Star Wars fans may have recognized saga staple Warwick Davis' voice during the Canto Bight scene, as the actor voiced one of the aliens in the casino. Even Mark Hamill earned an additional role, providing the vocalizations for the alien who attempts to put coins in BB-8.  You can get The Last Jedi on Digital HD now and on Blu-ray March 27th.  Which cameo in The Last Jedi was your favorite? Let us know in the comments below!  [H/T Film School Rejects]	0
"Demi Lovato is six years stronger.  The Tell Me You Love Me singer teared up on-stage at her New York City show on Friday night, after tourmates DJ Khaled and Kehlani surprised her during her set to wish her a happy six years of sobriety.  ""What you've overcome through trials and tribulations, through dark clouds,"" Khaled told his friend and collaborator. ""You found the sunshine, and now the sun is shining on you forever.""  ""I'm so, so, so, so proud of you, and honored to know you,"" Kehlani added.  After the two exited, Lovato got emotional while addressing her fans, who had begun chanting her name.  ""Kehlani and DJ Khaled, thank you so much,"" the 25-year-old singer said. ""That was so inspirational and so powerful and so meaningful.""  Lovato then, through tears, walked fans through her sobriety journey.  ""Yesterday, six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning, throwing up in the car,"" she recalled. ""I remember thinking, 'This is no longer cute, this is no longer fun. And I'm just like my dad.' So I took a look at my life, and I said, 'Something has to change. Something has to change, I've gotta get sober' -- so I did.""  ""The reason I became so open about my story is I know that there are people here tonight that need to ask for help, and I want you to know that it's OK,"" she continued as the audience cheered.

I feel weak everytime Demi cries 😭😩 https://t.co/8RZlZ4cxyg — zhania (@lovathiccs) March 17, 2018  After her remarks, Lovato went into a gripping rendition of her song, ""Warrior,"" which deals with painful memories from her past. Lovato has penned songs about her troubled family life growing up, with some of the tracks being about her late father, Patrick, who she has at times referred to as ""abusive.""  Watching Lovato work through her personal struggles has hopefully inspired those who look up to her to do the same.  One emotional rock for Lovato has been her mom, Dianna Hart. On Saturday, Lovato posted to Instagram a sweet photo of her hugging her mother, writing: ""I love my momma so much #myhero.""  ""So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible,"" Lovato tweeted on Wednesday, further celebrating her sixth sober birthday.  Just officially turned 6 years sober. So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible. 🙏🏼 — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) March 15, 2018  ET spoke with Lovato just after she reached five years sober last March, and she opened up about keeping clean.  ""What keeps me on this path is there's a drive that I have to stay sober because I know that my life depends on it,"" she reflected. ""If I would have continued down that road, I don't know if I'd be here today.""

"Roger Ailes, Former Fox News CEO, Dies At 77  Enlarge this image toggle caption Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images  Former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has died, the network says, citing a statement from the late executive's family. Ailes resigned from his post leading Fox News last July, amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was 77.  Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996. On Thursday, the network initially announced his death by citing the Drudge Report, which had published a statement from Ailes' wife, Elizabeth.  According to Fox News, that statement reads:  ""I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise — and to give back.""  Remembrances Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Listen · 4:36 4:36  Anchors of the channel's morning show Fox & Friends were noticeably emotional in announcing Ailes' death.  ""Beth, you are in our thoughts and prayers,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""and so is Zachary, their beautiful son. Roger, rest in peace.""  Ailes was famous for his shrewd leadership of Fox, including his focus on airing conservative opinions and hiring anchors and reporters with big personalities. But he left Fox with a tarnished legacy, facing legal actions over allegations of sexual harassment.  Ailes denied accusations that he built a culture at Fox that encouraged harassment, after a lawsuit by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson prompted other women at the network, including high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to step forward with similar claims. He abruptly resigned last July.  In the decades before he created a ratings juggernaut in Fox News, Ailes worked in politics, serving as a media adviser and consultant — most famously for Richard Nixon, whom Ailes helped to win the presidency in 1968. He later worked for other Republican leaders, from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Ailes was a producer of the variety and talk program The Mike Douglas Show when he met Nixon. In the years that followed, as NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Ailes ""kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once.""  The architect of Fox News was also close to President Trump, to whom he gave a weekly slot on Fox & Friends — a show that the president has regularly touted in his tweets from the White House.  Trump ""sort of represents Roger Ailes' legacy of 50 years of using television to advance a style — a populist style of conservative politics,"" journalist and author Gabriel Sherman told NPR's Terry Gross last summer.  Sherman, who wrote a biography of Ailes titled The Loudest Voice In The Room, also spoke to Terry back in 2014, when his book was first published.  Discussing Ailes' impact on politics and culture in the U.S., Sherman said, ""One of Ailes' lasting legacies will be that for millions of Americans, news is now no longer viewed as a way to be informed about the world; it's a way of gathering information that advances your side."""	0
"Yesterday, Kylie Jenner said she'll no longer be sharing pictures of Stormi's face, and the reason is beyond heartbreaking.  An insider told People that Kylie made the decision because of the ""nasty"" comments she was seeing on pictures of her daughter.  “Kylie felt so protective of her baby when she was pregnant. This is why she didn’t share any bump pictures while she was pregnant. After Stormi was born, Kylie was the proudest mom.”  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  “She couldn’t wait to show off Stormi to her fans. She posted pictures, because she was so excited to be a mom. Unfortunately, social media is a crazy place. People have been making nasty comments.""  “Kylie is shocked and doesn’t want her daughter’s pictures to be a part of something negative. She might reconsider in the future, but for now, she won’t post any more photos of Stormi’s face.”  On Sunday, Kylie posted the below photo, which showed only part of Stormi's head, and when a commenter called her out on cropping out her daughter, she said ""yeah I cut my baby out. I’m not sharing photos of my girl right now.""    i spy with my little eye... A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jun 10, 2018 at 11:38am PDT  That's when fans noticed that Kylie had gone back and deleted old photos of Stormi, too.    The decision comes amid (very crazy and somewhat rude) rumors that Kylie's baby isn't actually Travis Scott's. In May, people on Instagram started taking pictures of Stormi's face and placing them next to photos of Kylie's former bodyguard Tim Chung, commenting on how similar the two looked. Tim denied the rumor via a statement on social media.  And Kylie did her part when she posted a photo of her and Travis from the Met Gala with the caption ""Stormi's parents.""

The model looked ecstatic to be chatting with the self-proclaimed Lord, who could be seen on her phone lounging on a chaise outside with sunglasses on.  The duo sparked romance rumors after Disick, 34, was spotted getting close to Richie aboard a yacht in Cannes at the end of May. Richie later took to Twitter to squash the rumors.  “Just so everyone can get their panties out of their asses, Scott and I are just homies,” she tweeted, along with the hashtag #relax.

And the warm welcome is sure to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days.  As they're now expecting a baby, it's exciting to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an impressive royal tour wardrobe along the way.  But what makes Meghan and Harry's appearance at the Invictus Games 2018 so significant is the fact that they first made their public debut as a couple at last year's event. And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year.  On September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries:  Getty Images AFP Contributor  The separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event:  Getty Images Danny Lawson - PA Images  After that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017:  Now, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more unified than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have truly become a unit. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly supporting the causes and organizations that are important to them both.  Having gotten married in May 2018, and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess aren't wasting time when it comes to their love story.	0
I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.	1

"Jennifer Anne Garner (born April 17, 1972)[1] is an American actress. Following a supporting role in Pearl Harbor (2001), Garner gained recognition for her performance as CIA officer Sydney Bristow in the ABC spy-action thriller Alias, which aired from 2001 to 2006. For her work on the series, she won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, and received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations.  While working on Alias, Garner garnered a cameo role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), followed by a praised leading performance in the romantic comedy film 13 Going on 30 (2004). Garner has appeared in supporting as well as lead film roles, including the superhero films Daredevil (2003) and Elektra (2005), the comedy-drama Juno (2007), and the fantasy-comedy The Invention of Lying (2009). In the 2010s, she appeared in the romantic-comedy Valentine's Day (2010), the fantasy comedy-drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012), the biographic drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), the comedy film Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (2014), the drama film Miracles from Heaven (2016), and the romantic comedy-drama film Love, Simon (2018).  Garner works frequently as an activist for early childhood education and is a board member of Save the Children. She is also an advocate for anti-paparazzi campaigns among children of celebrities. Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley from 1998 to 2003, during which they married. Garner married actor Ben Affleck in 2005; they separated in 2015 and divorced in 2018. Garner and Affleck have three children together.  Early life [ edit ]  Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972, in Houston, Texas, but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three. She is the second of three daughters.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide, and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was ""very conservative"" and her mother ""quietly blue.""[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, she and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's ""take on the world"" was ""practically Amish.""[12]  Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get ""straight As"" and instead wanted to perform ""in any kind of production.""[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994 she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]  Acting career [ edit ]  1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias [ edit ]  As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996 she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]  After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to ""provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight""[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]  Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: ""I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that.""[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: ""You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross.""[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought ""an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness"" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.  2002–2011: Transition to film [ edit ]  While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an ""other-worldly"" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure ""she would be the next superstar"".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered ""an aptitude for"" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she ""realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material.""[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.  Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year-old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her ""startling"": ""Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else.""[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an ""utterly beguiling"" performance: ""You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star.""[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: ""Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for.""[57] 13 Going on 30 grossed US$96 million worldwide.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner ""is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability ""to blend charm and gravity""[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her ""natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role.""[63]  After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: ""She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card.""[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never ""been lovelier or more affecting.""[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008 Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as ""captivating"": "" Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess's peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she's a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable.""[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her ""feistiness"" and "" lightness of comic touch"".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]  The Invention of Lying in 2009 Garner at a press conference forin 2009  Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, portraying the childhood friend of a famous photographer and womanizer (McConaughey). While the film received lukewarm reviews, it grossed US$102.2 million worldwide.[72] Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner ""easy to like and sharp with her timing"", he was disappointed to see her as ""the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character.""[73] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as ""less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words ""enter generic female lead"" in [the] screenplay).""[74]  Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner – ""always happy and always pleasant to everyone"" – against type.[75] In the film, she played the love interest of the first human with the ability to lie (Gervais) in a world where people can only tell the truth. Reviews for the movie were mixed and it made US$32.4 million worldwide.[76] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she ""proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on.""[77] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she ""has never been better onscreen [...] Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before.""[78]  In Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), she shared scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[79] The film made US$56.2 million in its U.S. opening weekend,; it eventually grossed US$110.4 million domestically and US$216.4 million worldwide.[80] In 2011, she had a supporting role as a villainous arranged bride in the comedy Arthur, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name, directed by Steve Gordon and co-starring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren.[81][82]  Butter in 2011 Garner at the premiere ofin 2011  Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton, in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green, which followed a magical pre-adolescent boy whose personality and naïveté have profound effects on the people in his town.[83] The film received mixed reviews from critics and made a modest US$56 million worldwide.[84][85] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her ""convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom""[86] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought ""fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity"" to the role.[87] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, in which she played an overly competitive and socially ambitious woman participating in a local butter sculpturing competition in a small Iowa town. Distributed for a limited release in certain parts of the United States only, Butter received mixed reviews and grossed US$105,018.[88][89] Peter Debruge of Variety praised ""the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner's comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30""[90] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the ""best in show"" : ""[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd.""[91] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: ""Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one.""[92] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena,[93] and became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[94]  Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 drama Dallas Buyers Club, portraying the role of a doctor treating AIDS patients in Texas during the mid-1980s.[95][96] The film received significant acclaim and was a box office success.[97] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as ""a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity""[98] and Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: ""Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here.""[99] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: ""It's not a well-shaped role, but I've gotten to the point where I'm happy to see Garner in anything. She's incapable of phoniness.""[100] Also in 2013, Garner became the first celebrity spokesperson of the Italian fashion brand Max Mara.[101]  In 2014, Garner starred opposite Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day, as the fictional salary cap analyst of Cleveland Browns. Critical reception towards the film was mixed and Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle describing her part, remarked: ""It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice.""[102] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, taking on the role of the mother of the titular character. The film grossed US$101 million worldwide.[103] Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: ""Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled.""[104] Her other film role in 2014 was that of an overprotective mother in the dramedy Men, Women & Children, directed by Jason Reitman and co-starring Rosemarie DeWitt, Judy Greer, Dean Norris, and Adam Sandler. The film made a US$2.2 million worldwide,[105] and Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: ""Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it's not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption.""[106] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[107]  In 2015's Danny Collins, a drama inspired by the true story of folk singer Steve Tilston and starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner played the supporting role of the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. The film was released in selected cinemas and was warmly received by critics; Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she ""gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion.""[108] In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven, playing the mother of a young girl who had a near-death experience and was later cured of an incurable disease. The film grossed US$73.9 million worldwide[109] and received generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt it ""makes the most out of an outstanding performance"" from Garner.[110] Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a ""dedicated"" and ""heartfelt"" performance[111] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found ""her subtly wrought work [...] tremendously effective"" in an otherwise ""crassly manipulative"" film.[112] Also in 2016, she starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the critically panned comedy Nine Lives, playing the second wife of a workaholic father who has his mind trapped inside of his daughter's new cat. Garner made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day (2016).  Garner appeared in the drama Wakefield, which premiered at TIFF and was released in May 2017.[113] Also in 2017, she starred in The Tribes of Palos Verdes, and in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions.[114][115] In 2018, she co-starred in Love, Simon, an adaptation of the young adult novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[116] Also that year, Garner voiced the role of Mama Llama for Netflix's original animated preschool series Llama Llama, and starred as the lead in the action-revenge film Peppermint, which was released on September 7.[117] In August 2018, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[118]  Activism [ edit ]  Early childhood education [ edit ]  Garner with a preschooler at a Capitol Hill event in 2013  In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[119][120] Since 2014,[121] Garner has served on the board of trustees for the organization,[122][123][124] advocating for early childhood education.[125] As an ambassador she frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[126]  In 2011, Garner partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[127] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: ""My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone.""[128] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.[123] In 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[129]  Other [ edit ]  In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[130] In 2006, she spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[131] In 2008 she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[132][133] In 2007, Garner said she was ""not a particularly outwardly political person.""[68] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[134] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser in support of Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana.[135] Garner also attended voter registration and phone bank events in support of Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[136]  In 2007, Garner appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[137]  Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. ""There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class.

"Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards  Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13 honors, surpassing Adele's mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night, delivering a fiery performance in the middle of the famous Bellagio fountain and, maybe, getting himself a date after hitting on co-host Vanessa Hudgens during his acceptance speech for winning Top Billboard 200 Album for Views.  Watch  ""It's crazy that we're all here on earth for a limited amount of time, and we gotta show love while we're here,"" he said on stage midway through the telecast, before getting straight to the point: ""Vanessa Hudgens, you look incredible tonight."" (Hudgens acknowledged that shortly afterward by asking if she was on the invite list for Drake's afterparty.)  By then, Drake had already racked up 12 BBMAs -- 10 in the pre-telecast categories, and one earlier in the show for Top Male Artist -- on his way to a record-breaking 13 victories, which he achieved with the evening's final honor, Top Artist, to overtake Adele's previous record of 12 in 2012. It's an impressive number for an artist who utterly dominated 2016, shattering streaming records over and over again with the success of his album Views and its monster single ""One Dance"" featuring WizKid and Kyla.  ""Life is like toilet paper,"" he said while accepting his final award. ""Either you're on a roll, or taking sh-t from assholes.""  Cher was presented with the prestigious Icon Award and rolled back the years with a high-powered performance of her iconic songs ""Believe"" and ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" -- sporting, fittingly, completely different looks for each performance -- a day after her 71st birthday. ""I've wanted to do what I do since I was four years old, and I've been doing it for 53 years,"" she said with a humble air during her acceptance speech. ""I think luck has so much to do with with my success... I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in.""  Drake also won Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Billboard 200 Artist and Top Rap Artist, and took home awards for song sales, song streams and several rap and R&B categories on his way to lucky 13. Beyoncé earned Top Female Artist, Zayn was awarded Top New Artist and Blake Shelton (Country), Beyoncé (R&B), Twenty One Pilots (Rock), Juan Gabriel (Latin), The Chainsmokers (Dance/Electronic) and Lauren Daigle (Christian) and Kirk Franklin (Gospel) won top artist honors in their respective genres. Twenty One Pilots and Beyoncé were also big winners on the night, with five BBMAs apiece, while The Chainsmokers earned four.  The show spent most of its three hours, fittingly, on performances and awards rather than hosting gimmicks, with 15 performances that ran the gamut of genres from hip-hop to pop to dance to rock to country. Nicki Minaj opened the show with a star-studded medley that included her Remy Ma diss track ""No Frauds,"" which she performed with Lil Wayne, David Guetta's ""Light My Body Up,"" Jason Derulo's ""Swalla"" and her own ""Regret In Your Tears,"" bringing out each superstar in turn. Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus both delivered the live debuts of their new singles -- Cabello's first solo songs since leaving Fifth Harmony, an emotional-yet-brief ""I Have Questions"" and a heated-up ""Crying In the Club,"" and Cyrus' country-tinged comeback release ""Malibu"" -- while Lorde (""Green Light,"" performed as if at a goofy and awkward karaoke night), Sam Hunt (""Body Like a Back Road"") and John Legend (""Surefire""), who was then joined by Florida Georgia Line for a surprise joint rendition of FGL's ""H.O.L.Y.,"" all chipped in with memorable performances.  Hudgens was a natural in her first year as co-host alongside veteran BBMAs host Ludacris, and their monologue would have had her in the headlines regardless of Drake's unabashed flirting. In hyping the performances to come, Hudgens showed off both her pipes and rapping skills with a cappella versions of Celine Dion's ""Power of Love"" and Nicki Minaj's verse from ""Monster,"" impressing both Luda and the crowd in the process.  Speaking of Dion, the diva performed her iconic song ""My Heart Will Go On"" 20 years after its initial prominence as the main song from the blockbuster Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet film Titanic, navigating the challenging track effortlessly and earning an extended standing ovation. (Read Billboard's oral history of the song right here.) It was easily one of the standout moments of the night, and impressive in its emotion and vocal dexterity.  Diddy also took the stage to pay tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. on what would have been the rapper's 45th birthday and debuted the trailer for his upcoming Bad Boy Records documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop. ""It all started with the Notorious B.I.G.,"" Diddy said, referencing Bad Boy's creation and the 500 million albums it sold over the past 20-plus years. ""Big sold over 25 million records worldwide; his Ready to Die album, his Life After Death album, classics... Biggie was the best rapper I ever had the chance to work with. Watching him and seeing him work is something that words can't explain.""  Bruno Mars, whose recent awards show performances have leaned more towards glitzy funk showstoppers like ""24K Magic"" and his excellent tribute to Prince alongside The Time during the Grammys earlier this year, took a different route for this one, getting passionate with his latest single ""Versace On the Floor"" as the show wound towards its conclusion.  But there was only one way it would end: with Drake complete his record-breaking evening with the top award to go with his new place in BBMA history. His huge night catapulted him into the top 10 of artists who have won the most Billboard Music Awards over the years, though he still has a way to go to catch Taylor Swift at 21. But with the March release of his playlist-album More Life already shattering records he'd set last year with Views, it's hard to imagine he won't be gracing BBMA stages for years to come."	0
Taylor Swift, photographed Nov. 2017. Billy & Hells for TIME  Before the Harvey Weinstein allegations broke, and before #MeToo swept the Internet, Taylor Swift testified in court on Aug. 10 about being assaulted in a room full of people. Swift, who TIME recognized as one of the Silence Breakers who inspired women to speak out about harassment in this year’s Person of the Year issue, granted TIME her first interview since the trial.  In 2013, the singer-songwriter took a photo with a Colorado radio DJ after an interview. During that photo, Swift says, DJ David Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end. Swift privately reported the incident to the station at which Mueller worked, and he was fired. Mueller then sued Swift for defamation; she countersued for a symbolic $1—and won.  Swift refused to be bullied on the stand. Her straightforward testimony was lauded by many for its fierceness. When asked why the pictures taken during the assault didn’t show the front of her skirt wrinkled as evidence of any wrongdoing, she said simply, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” When asked if she felt guilty about Mueller losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”  Like many of the women interviewed for the 2017 Person of the Year issue, Swift would not accept blame for the abuse she experienced. Her clear-eyed testimony marked one of several major milestones in the conversation around sexual harassment this year. Swift responded to questions about her experience from TIME in writing.  Why was it important for you to come forward about what happened to you?  In 2013, I met a DJ from a prominent country radio station in one of my pre-show meet and greets. When we were posing for the photo, he stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek. I squirmed and lurched sideways to get away from him, but he wouldn’t let go. At the time, I was headlining a major arena tour and there were a number of people in the room that saw this plus a photo of it happening. I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance. It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know. The radio station conducted its own investigation and fired him. Two years later, he sued me.  How did you feel when you testified?  When I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man’s attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over inane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying. My mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn’t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn’t hold back on my mom—why should I be polite? I’m told it was the most amount of times the word “ass” has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.  Watch: Why the Silence Breakers Are the 2017 Person of the Year  How have people responded to your story?  People have been largely very supportive of my story since the trial began in August, but before that, I spent two years reading headlines referring to it as “The Taylor Swift Butt Grab Case” with internet trolls making a joke about what happened to me. The details were all skewed, as they often are. Most people thought I was suing him. There was an audible gasp in the courtroom when I was named as the defendant. Once it hit the news that I was in Denver dealing with this, there was an outpouring of support on social media and I have never appreciated it more. I spoke to Kesha on the phone and it really helped to talk to someone who had been through the demoralizing court process.  After this experience, what advice would you give to your fans?  I would tell people who find themselves in this situation that there is a great deal of blame placed on the victims in cases of sexual harassment and assault. You could be blamed for the fact that it happened, for reporting it and blamed for how you reacted. You might be made to feel like you’re overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you. You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.  Is this a watershed moment for the way we think about sexual assault and harassment in culture?  I think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn’t be tolerated. Going to court to confront this type of behavior is a lonely and draining experience, even when you win, even when you have the financial ability to defend yourself. Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances. When the jury found in my favor, the man who sexually assaulted me was court-ordered to give me a symbolic $1. To this day he has not paid me that dollar, and I think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself.  This interview has been edited and condensed.	1
"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also"	1
"Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted networkUPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic ""clear recovery,"" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.Kurtz quickly said, ""This is not the graphic we're looking for – hold off.

"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have ended their relationship once again, at least temporarily.  Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.  On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.  Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup  In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.  So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?  Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey  During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.  Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.  A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'  However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.  'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.  So apparently Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are on a break and all I can picture Justin singing ""What Do You Mean?"" — Maddie (@maddie_harper99) March 14, 2018  Selena Gomez's family  It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.  The source said: 'Justin's family loves Selena, but Selena's family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don't trust Justin.  'Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed...but her family just isn't budging right now.'  E! shared a similar report, claiming 'family pressure' and other issues led to their breakup.  'She's on a break with Justin partly because of family pressure but also because of some issues surrounding his birthday,' a source said.  'She wanted to have a quiet birthday celebration with Justin and he wanted to go big and involve all of his church friends. They had a disagreement that didn't end well.'  jelena is fine. they hate the media and are doing everything they can to avoid it. and there’s nothing wrong with that because they have nothing to prove to anyone. stop being so negative and good night �� — . (@biebsftlife) March 15, 2018  Justin Bieber's attitude  Amid rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber called it quits, Us reported that Justin's attitude may have been a contributing factor in the demise of their rekindled romance.  '[He] doesn't care about anyone but himself,' a source said.  'The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn't need him.'  Infidelity  A rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena. Some seem to believe the once-troubled singer had something going on with Petra Collins, whom Selena recently unfollowed on Instagram.  That rumor hasn't been substantiated, however. Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.  They didn't break up  While many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they're still going strong.  Entertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.  A source said: 'Selena is very delicate; her ""comeback"" to the spotlight has been tough — especially with the interest in her personal life with Justin and her mother.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber spotted leaving the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California together despite breakup rumors. pic.twitter.com/Ey7aHofjbT — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) March 8, 2018  'She is taking time to herself. This is not the first time she has done this.'  The insider added: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too. She needs to figure out how to live the life she wants in the spotlight — if that's even possible.'  This theory appears to be popular among fans of both Justin and Selena, who believe they're still together but are in hiding. Some tweeters seem to think the couple simply don't like the media circus surrounding their relationship, so they're laying low.  This theory does seemingly hold up, as both Justin and Selena have complained about paparazzi attention in the past.  Will Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber get back together?  A recent report from People magazine suggests that reconciliation is imminent for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. Their sources say fans should expect to see that sooner, rather than later.  'They've been having disagreements, but it wouldn't be surprising if they're back together in a week,' the Jelena insider said.  Similarly, E! reported that this is 'likely not the end' for Selena and Justin.  Selena Gomez will be 75 years old and still on again/off again with Justin Bieber. I hope they don't procreate. — CJ (@TheTweetsOfCJ) March 15, 2018  A source said: '[Selena] wanted some time to clear her head and get away before figuring out what's coming next.'  Another added: 'They will absolutely get back together and they are not over, but they both need some time away from each other.'  Justin Bieber-Selena Gomez relationship history  Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have a long, somewhat-sordid history that dates back to about 2010.  The pair, who met in 2009, were spotted out together sharing a meal at a Philadelphia IHOP in 2010, which prompted rumors about the status of their relationship.  At the time, Selena told Us: 'It was just pancakes!'  So basically jelena is still dating but just hangs out in completely private places. They’re not broken up y’all need to relax. — chloe (@biebcum) March 14, 2018  Not long after that sighting, Selena and Justin were seen looking couple-like at a concert in Miami, however, Justin told MTV he was 'just having fun being a teenager'.  In January 2011, things between Justin and Selena heated up and they were seen locking lips during a vacation in St. Lucia.  The following month they were photographed together during Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party in Hollywood, California. They held hands at the event, essentially confirming that they were a couple.  They looks so sad. It is obvious that Jelena broke up pic.twitter.com/cV9RuvoI4Z — Ann (@Guccifloralhs) March 15, 2018  In September 2011, Justin rented out the Staples Center for just himself and Selena. The pair enjoyed a private screening of Titanic. Afterward, Justin tweeted: 'Romance isn't dead.'  For Valentine's Day in 2012, Justin gifted Selena with a ring bearing a diamond encrusted J, which she proudly showed off on Twitter.  In April of that same year, the couple was caught on kiss cam while enjoying a Lakers game together. They pair obliged, but Selena later told Ryan Seacrest it was 'the most humiliating thing'.  Their love story came to a screeching halt in November 2012. The pair reportedly decided to take some time apart due to 'busy schedules'.  Rumors began swirling about them again in April 2013, when Justin shared a photo of himself shirtless in bed being snuggled by Selena.  The following month they were seen sharing a kiss, while Selena's gal pal Taylor Swift looked on in disgust.  Social media remained rife with speculation about the pair, who were later spotted by TMZ taking a Segway cruise around Calabasas, California, together.  Selena and Justin both dated other people while broken up, but eventually found their way back to one another."	1
ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1
Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Getty  According to the publication bombshell report, both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins as part of 'one big, happy family.'  An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.  Related: Confirmed: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - 'Yes, it's twins!'

In Touch reveals Kate 'has penned a pregnancy food list for Meghan that's full of nutritious things to eat and is advising her on how to balance motherhood with life as a royal,' says the source.  Fitness enthusiast Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, is returning the favour by teaching Kate pregnancy yoga.  The publication adds that the two pregnant women are happily letting their husbands dote on them.  'William is doing his best to help Kate relax by being a hands-on father to George, Louis and Charlotte,' says the source.  'He brings Kate tea and cookies in bed,' including lavender biscuits which are known to help with nausea.  Getty  Kate, adds the source, is 'convinced she's having another girl because she's having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.'  Meghan is hoping for one of each - a boy and a girl - the insider tells In Touch.  'This is a dream come true for both couples.'  The royal family is yet to respond to In Touch's report.  The latest edition of New Idea Royals explores what REALLY happened at Prince Louis' royal christening.	1

Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Chuck stars Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski are reuniting for an episode of the Disney Channel's Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series is a spinoff of the 2010 animated film, Tangled, starring Levi and Mandy Moore.  Action comedy series Chuck aired on NBC from 2007 to 2012. The series starred Levi as Chuck Bartowski, a nerd who has all of the government's secrets downloaded into his brain. Assigned to protect Chuck is the beautiful but deadly CIA agent Sarah Walker (Strahovksi). Chuck and Sarah have to work together to foil terrorist plots, defeat enemy spies, and diffuse bombs. Though the two adopt a fake relationship as part of their cover, the pair eventually become a couple in season 3 and marry in the season 4 finale. Due to low ratings, the show faced threats of cancellation with each season, but with the help of a devoted fan base, the series was able to last for five seasons.  As reported by E! Online, The two leads of Chuck will reunite on TV for the first time in six years for the season 2 premiere of Disney's animated series, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series features Levi in the lead role of Eugene/Flynn Rider, the character he voiced in the Tangled movie. Strahovski will guest star in the season 2 premiere as Eugene's ex-fiancée, Stalyan. Like their Chuck characters, Eugene and Stalyan have a deep romantic history and were once a great team. In a clip for E! Online, Levi and Strahovksi discuss their characters and talk about working together again - see the clip on E! Online's site.  Disney's computer-animated musical adventure film, Tangled was a love story between Levi's character, Flynn Rider, and Moore's Rapunzel. Nominated for several awards, Tangled was considered a critical and commercial success. In 2017, the story was brought back in the form of a TV movie on the Disney Channel, Tangled Ever After, which evolved into Tangled: The Series, with the two lead roles reprised by Levi and Moore. After its first season, the show was retitled Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure.  Even though Chuck's series finale was able to wrap up loose ends and give the characters a proper send-off, Levi has been working on reviving the series as a film. Whether this happens or not, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure will finally reunite Levi and Strahovksi, which could be fun for fans of Chuck.  Season 2 of Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure premieres Sunday at 7:45 PM ET on the Disney Channel.  Source: E! Online  NOS4A2 First Look Photo: Zachary Quinto Is A Soul-Sucking Monster	0
Actor tells Stephen Colbert on The Late Show he ‘couldn’t be happier’ to resume 007 role despite previous comments  He once said he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007. But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.  Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won’t he play the character for a fifth time.  “I have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I’ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig’s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather “slit my wrists” than reprise the role.  “I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.  Say never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more  Neither – should they both happen – will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.  Thanks to Craig’s reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. “I’m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I’ve not even played the role,” he said in 2015. “Enough is enough. I can’t talk about it any more.”  Craig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the “best screen Bond to date”.  Skyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015’s Spectre, which was described by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw as “terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure” cost $245m to make – the most expensive Bond film to date – but was also box office gold, taking in $880m worldwide.  Craig has not been solely negative about the impact playing Bond has had on his life, and said he did not worry about being typecast because the role had “changed my working life in an incredible way”.  dani ✨ (@boldlygaying) DANIEL CRAIG CONFIRMED HES BACK AS BOND FOR 2 MORE MOVIES!!!! pic.twitter.com/IbxevPJLZd  He added: “There are more opportunities. I could do many, many things. But it takes an awful amount of time. If anything, the restriction is that it is incredibly time-consuming. That’s the restriction.”  The producers are also rumoured to be determined to bring back Adele to record the theme tune, after her song written for Skyfall became the first 007 theme to win a Grammy and a Golden Globe award.  The next Bond film, the 25th in the series, is scheduled for release in November 2019.	0

This week, Kanye West has caused controversy across the globe thanks to his erratic and bizarre Tweets - including supporting US President Donald Trump and claims that slavery was a 'choice.'  The 40-year-old rapper called himself the 'future president', bragged about his 'dragon energy' and announced he had fired his management because he 'can't be managed.' Wife Kim Kardashian was quick to jump to his defense, tweeting to her fans it was unfair to label her husband 'mentally ill' because he has always been 'expressive.'  In 2016, Kanye spent time in a psychiatric facility due to a mental breakdown.  Now, Life & Style has explosively claimed today that the rapper's problems are more serious than ever, with insiders claiming they've led to the disintegration of his four year marriage.  'Kim is in talks with lawyers about getting a divorce,' a friend close to Kim told Life & Style. 'Kanye's acting more unpredictable than ever. Things have gotten so bad that Kim and Kanye sleep in separate rooms.'	1
Brad Pitt.  Noted sculptor Brad Pitt is famously single — and apparently fighting off gangs of thirsty women everywhere he goes. So it should come as no surprise that sometimes the baggy-pants aficionado chooses to go incognito with the ladies by using a different name. Or should we say, his real name.  As Wikipedia confirms, Brad Pitt was actually born William Bradley Pitt. And wouldn’t you know, according to “Page Six,” dear ol’ Brad recently introduced himself as William when chatting with a lady at Coffee Commissary in Los Angeles.  Pitt reportedly showed up on his motorcycle, wearing “sunglasses, jeans and a leather jacket” (how cool), and sparked up a conversation with a woman in line who “looked a little like Kate Bosworth, but it wasn’t her.” Per “Page Six”:  When the woman said, “I’m Lydia,” Pitt “put out his hand and said, ‘Hi, I’m William.’ She replied, ‘Oh, you look like a Bradley.’ And he responded, ‘Well, that’s my middle name’ and smiled and winked at her.”  As Lydia exited she said, “‘Nice to meet you, Bradley . . . I mean William.’ He laughed to himself, then got on his bike.”  Sounds a lot like another William we know.	0

Toronto’s very own Drake says he was a victim of a “fake media story” after rumours surfaced online that he told a fan to take off her hijab at one of his concerts. The rapper posted on Instagram that he was talking to four women, one of whom was wearing a winter scarf, and he told her to take it off.  Drake will likely focus his attention to the Grammy Awards this weekend. The Canadian is up for eight awards, including album of the year. ( Arthur Mola / AP fiole photo )  “I make a point every night to end my shows on tones of unity and love, so, to find out that I am being utilized in a fake media story about me disrespecting Muslims is devastating to me,” Drake wrote in the post. “I am well aware of what a hijab is, and I would never make a disrespectful comment like that in my life towards someone who is wearing one.”  Article Continued Below  After videos surfaced of the rapper telling the fan to take off the scarf, some called for a boycott his concerts on social media. Drake wrapped up the post with a call for unity. “I am proud that my closest friends and fans come from all different religions and races,” Drake continued. “Perhaps whoever made up this story should spend more time learning about other cultures and less time trying to divide us.” Now, Drake will likely focus his attention to the Grammy Awards this weekend.

Is Robsten back from the dead? Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson reunited and got ‘Twilight’ fans buzzing, but we’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned if these two exes are getting back together or not.  For one moment, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan was once again a couple and all was right in the world for Twilight fans. Ex-lovers Robert Pattinson, 28, and Kristen Stewart, 32, attended Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party on June 1. However, don’t expect their love to rise from the grave. “There’s no chance of any kind of romantic reconciliation for Rob and Kristen,” a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “That ship has well and truly sailed, and way too much has passed between them to ever reunite in that way. Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.”  While there’s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it’s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it’s “great” that they’ve “finally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will—she was his first real love.” As for Kristen, she “feels a little awkward when she sees Rob,” because she still “carries a lot of guilt” from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that “everything is good between them, and he doesn’t harbor any bad feelings towards her.”  Too bad, Twilight fans. Bella’s not getting back with Edward – or Jacob, for that matter. This should come as no surprises, as the two didn’t really seem to be that enamored with each other at Lily-Rose’s birthday party, as a source from the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles – where the bash was held – EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that they had “very cordial conversations, but it was minimal at best.” Oh, there was no drama – but there was no real chemistry either. Oh well.  Prior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a “low-key meet-up” in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could “maybe start over again …but this time it means forever.” Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer’s books.	1

"The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.  The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.  Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.  Advertisement  ""The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"" Lee said.  Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images  ""As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""  Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.  ""By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"" Lee said.  ""New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""  Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.  ""But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"" Lee said.  Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it."	1

This is the kind of thing you can't make up. When Tyga, Blac Chyna, and Lamar Odom all got the invite to attend the iGO.live launch event at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Wednesday, they all RSVP'd yes. That's right, three KarJenner exes (formerly the loves of Kylie Jenner (and, well, Blac Chyna), Rob Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian, respectively) all showed up to the same event -- and we have the photos to prove it.  Blac Chyna at the event in L.A. on Wednesday, also attended by...  ...Tyga...  ...and Lamar Odom.  In fact, Lamar and Chyna were even photographed together inside the bash, which was also attended by The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Dorit Kemsley, Hailey Baldwin, Pepa (of Salt-n-Papa fame, duh!), Fifth Harmony, and Ashley Benson.  Lamar and Chyna hanging out together inside the party, because this is the world we live in.  Wait, did we forget to mention there was yet another person connected to the KarJenners who partied at the bash? Yes, Scott Disick's maybe one-time fling Bella Thorne was also there.  Hey! Bella Thorne was ALSO there...  OK, wait -- it gets better. Robert Shapiro (who most recently represented Chyna's ex, Rob) was also there(!). YES, ROBERT SHAPIRO. We know he's technically not a Kardashian or Jenner ex, but he is Kardashian adjacent, and having him in the mix makes this guest list substantially more intriguing and weird. Hands down.  ...as was Robert Shapiro because WHY NOT!?!?  Oh, to be a fly on that wall because...	0
Kate Middleton wasn't always a royal — but she did some from a wealthy family. Eddie Mulholland - Pool/Getty Images  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn't always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton's net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here's everything we know about Middleton's net worth:  What is Kate Middleton's net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of two — who is expecting her third royal baby by the end of April— is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton's wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn't have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton's net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William's wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  What do we know about Kate Middleton's money?  Most of Middleton's net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew's. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton's net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn't need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family's royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million— as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.	0
Brooklyn Nine-Nine star says he did not speak out after unnamed ‘high-level’ executive groped his genitals for fear of being ostracised or jailed  Actor and former NFL star Terry Crews has claimed he was the victim of a sexual assault by a “high-level Hollywood executive”, but did not retaliate or speak out over the incident for fear of being ostracised or sent to jail.  Crews, who played for teams including the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers and the Washington Redskins and appears in the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, recounted the incident via a series of tweets.  The 49-year-old said he was prompted to share his story in the wake of the ongoing Harvey Weinstein scandal. “This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME,” he wrote.  Film producer Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by multiple women, including Asia Argento, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. Weinstein denies some of the allegations and says all his relationships were “consensual”.  terrycrews (@terrycrews) This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.)  terrycrews (@terrycrews) I decided not 2 take it further becuz I didn’t want 2b ostracized— par 4 the course when the predator has power n influence. (9/cont.)  Crews described how, at an industry function in 2016, an unnamed male executive groped his genitals in front of his wife and “grinned like a jerk” at the pair’s shocked response.  He said that he was tempted to retaliate, but was worried how the incident would be reported and feared he would go to jail. “‘240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho’ would be the headline the next day,” he wrote.  Crews said the executive later called to apologise, but did not give a reason for his actions. Crews chose not to publicise the incident for fear of being ostracised. “Par [for] the course when the predator has power [and] influence”, he wrote.  The actor said his experience had helped him “understand and empathize with those who have remained silent”. “But Harvey Weinstein is not the only perpetrator,” he added. Crews also expressed hope that, by making his experience public, he would “deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless”.	1
***WARNING: this piece contains spoilers through the most recent season of Game of Thrones***  Given the ceaseless flood of reviews, critiques, commentaries and anguished think-pieces that have emerged in its wake, it feels like Taylor Swift‘s new single “Look What You Made Me Do” has been with us for far longer than a mere five days. Its stunning performance on streaming and video charts and its stunningly-brutal critical reception were perhaps only eclipsed in the pop culture blogosphere this weekend by the season finale of Game of Thrones, an event every bit as anticipated and monoculturally-in tune as a TSwift music video.  With the two overlapping in such a profound way, it got this author thinking; maybe there is more in common between a song of ice and fire and a song interpolating Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” than we once thought. Maybe, just maybe, this happenstance of scheduling has allowed us to see with a clearer eye what Taylor Swift is up to with her latest album cycle: namely, that she has now become the Cersei Lannister of pop music.  Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  And while it may seem unfair to compare Swift to a monarch who murdered hundreds of innocent people by detonating a cache of explosives under a cathedral, the pop star’s current reinvention in support of her upcoming album Reputation carries many of the same personal traits that have allowed Cersei to usurp herself to the Iron Throne of Westeros. And not just because both of them are blonde, caucasian women enjoying more extremes of wealth and privilege than we are capable of imagining.  The lead-up to Taylor unveiling her latest radio-juggernaut was one that played on the now-widespread public opinion of the pop star being a ‘snake.’ While there are numerous plot points in that story (for a detailed overview, head here), the most integral is the moment last year when she was outed as a liar by Kim Kardashian West. The world saw for themselves that the Taylor Swift PR-factory had completely fabricated the notion that Kanye West acted without her knowledge or consent when honoring her with the lyrical compliment that they “might still have sex.” The catastrophic blow to her clean-cut image led Swift to decamp out of the public eye for the better part of a year, only emerging now with “Look What You Made Me Do,” a long-overdue – and some would argue, unnecessary – response.  Cersei found herself in a very similar PR disaster during Game of Thrones‘ fifth season. After cultivating an image of being a woman of high moral character worthy of a seat on the King’s Small Council, she had this narrative irrevocably destroyed by the High Sparrow (the Westerosi-equivalent of the Pope) who promptly had her imprisoned for adultery, treason and conspiracy for murder. Like Taylor, her cover was blown with cold, hard proof, and she was marched naked through the sea of jeering common-folk to atone for her sins. In Taylor’s case this naked march was metaphorical, yet the sentiment remains much the same.  Now, returned to positions of power after well-earned respites to lick their wounds, both women are employing a simple, one-point strategy: enact violent revenge on all those that have wronged them, regardless of any and all other factors. For Cersei, this meant that aforementioned cathedral explosion in order to cast aside her enemies and seize limitless power. For Taylor, it meant “Look What You Made Me Do,” a heavy-handed earworm written in order to cast aside her previous public perceptions and seize limitless pop music power.  The key to the psychology of both of these women at this new stage of their career is that they are performing a balancing act. Taylor and Cersei have demonstrably proven they are at the peak of their powers. They tell us with frequent, repetitive kiss-offs to their enemies, and they show us with their newfound affinity for black clothing and garments with pointed shoulders. But this heightened ‘do not fuck with me’ power lies in us accepting two, at-times conflicting narratives – that they are both victim and merciless badass.  HBO  This is not to say that a victim can never become a badass or vice versa, but in the case of both Taylor and Cersei, their personas now implore us to stand in awe of a mightiness earned not from good works but from being victimized by their detractors. Detractors who, for the record, were not necessarily wrong in their attempts to bring these women down a peg. Would we not have wanted Kim Kardashian to expose Taylor’s innocence for the self-serving marketing ploy it really is? Would we not have wanted the High Sparrow to point out that Cersei shouldn’t be a figurehead of the monarchy after conspiring with her cousin/lover to assassinate the previous king, her ex-husband?  And as Taylor begins to smash records left and right with her latest single and as Cersei continues to scheme her way into screwing over everyone at the cost of the innocent bystanders of her kingdom, it becomes clear to see that their new respective characters are, ultimately, a weak choice. Where before both women were reacting to high-stakes situations in ways that were questionable but grounded by a real-world motivation, they have now been reduced to one-dimensional figureheads of ‘who cares look at how mean I am’ untrustworthiness, bereft of all the rich character development they have built over the past decade.  There are endless ways to get even, but not all of them involve sacrificing every last trace of your character in the name of revenge, let alone a revenge that no one really cares about anymore.

"Oh my! Zedd and Selena Gomez were one of our favorite short-lived romances. They both seemed so sweet and so good for each other! However, there was a dark side.

It's been quite a while since Zedd, 27, and Selena Gomez, 25, dated in 2015, but we still have a special place for the couple in our hearts. Zedd was always so sweet and tender toward Selly, even after they split. However, it turns out that that wasn't ALWAYS the case. As a matter of fact, he told Billboard that there was a time when he was downright ""pissed"" while dating her! Click here for pics of the former duo.  ""Reporters were calling my parents,"" he said, describing how insane the media frenzy was after the public learned of the star-studded relationship. ""People were hacking my friends' phones. I was pissed."" It's not that he was surprised, but it was still freaky to be so bombarded. ""I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,"" he explained. ""She is one of the most talked about people in the world, but I had no idea how much that would change my life.""  Clearly Zedd isn't interested in being involved in that kind of media frenzy again. He refused to tell Billboard whether or not he's dating anyone at the moment. One thing he will talk about is his strong feelings towards Donald Trump. ""No matter how big the scandal is, no matter how insane a [Trump] tweet is, it just keeps going. You feel powerless, and that's terrible to me,"" he ranted. ""Take that to a bigger scale and you end up in North Korea, where people are slaves of their own country!"" He even urged his fellow EDM stars to use their voices, even when it's scary. ""They don't want to lose fans. I understand where they are coming from, but I disagree with that being a good reason not to speak up."""	0

So sweet! Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.  “OK, I know I’m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife’s new show – @thesinnerusa – is amazing,” the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. “It’s like nothing I’ve seen her in before, and she’s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. –JT.”  The actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a “whydunit” rather than a “whodunit,” follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. “I just did it. And I don’t know why,” a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.  Biel opened up about The Sinner, which is based on Petra Hammesfahr‘s 2008 novel of the same name, during a recent appearance on the Today show. “We are not looking for who, we are looking for why,” she said of the plot. “Why did this seemingly normal young woman who has a family and a child and husband, why did she do this horrific act? … We all as human beings have the possibility to snap and we don’t do it. But what makes us cross the line?”  The 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she’d react if her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. “It’s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it’s hard to say yes because it’s such an intense experience,” she said on Today. “It’s a tough business. It’s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.”  The Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.

The wait for Swifties is finally over.  After much, much speculation, Taylor Swift finally announced her sixth studio album, “Reputation,” on Wednesday. The album will be released on Nov. 10, with its first single dropping on Thursday night.  Swift posted the cover art for “Reputation” on her social media accounts.  Multiple sources told Variety that new music was coming this week, although Swift was expected to make the announcement on Friday.  The popstar had kept fans on their toes since last week. Last Friday, the third anniversary of the day she announced her first pop album — “1989” — and unveiled its debut single — “Shake It Off” — she deleted every post on her Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. This past Monday, she shared a cryptic 10-second video of a reptilian tail on social media.  Also significant: the MTV Video Music Awards are this Sunday. It’s been rumored that Swift will also release a video for the new song at the ceremony.  It’s been three years since Swift debuted the mega-selling “1989,” marking the longest break between albums since she debuted her first in 2006. She typically releases a new album every two years. Swift most recently collaborated with Zayn Malik on “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” for the “Fifty Shades Darker” soundtrack this year. She’s kept an unusually low profile over the past few months, posting sporadically on social media and making few public appearances.	0

"Gender Reveal Baseballs 2 Pack, Pink and Blue amazon.com $43.96 Shop Now  Jason Aldean hit a home run with this surprise!  The singer, 41, and wife Brittany Kerr, 30, planned a sweet baseball-themed gender reveal party for his two daughters and their 9-month-old son this weekend.  The couple, who announced the pregnancy last month, wanted to share the news with the kids in a special way. ""Jason and I already know what it is, so this is just for the girls to see their excitement,"" Brittany said in a post Jason shared on Instagram.  In the video, fans get to see Jason's two daughters from his first marriage, Keeley, 15, and Kendyl, 10, both make their prediction about the gender. Both girls got their wish when they took a swing at their respective baseballs and watched as they burst into pink powder.  Though their son Memphis is a little too young to have made his own guess, he did play a starring role in their original announcement, which included a photo of the baby boy in a ""big brother"" onesie.  Jason and Brittany were hoping for another child, but they weren't sure it would be possible after having to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments to conceive Memphis. ""We did IVF with our son, so we had to do that again with this one,"" Jason told People.com.    The country crooner also shared that he and Brittany were hoping to give Memphis another sibling close in age. “After having our son, we knew we wanted to have two kids,” Jason added. “I have my two older daughters already, so after Memphis was born we knew we wanted to have another one pretty quick.""  Congratulations, Aldean family!"	0
If, on Wednesday morning, you had risen early enough and rejoined the torrid, infinite march that is Twitter, you might have first learned of NBC’s termination of its morning-news lodestar, Matt Lauer, through neutral channels. At 6:52 A.M., the Times’s media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, tweeted, “BREAK: NBC Matt Lauer fired, inappropriate workplace behavior . . . story to come.” But, at 7 A.M., the “Today in New York” warmup ended, the friendly corporate bells chimed, and the “Today” show, as it has since 1952, started. The minutes in between were a chasm.  Stills of Lauer—bespectacled and reviewing notes in one, professorially inquisitive in another—crossed the screen as the voice of his co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, announced the breaking news that Lauer’s employment had been terminated overnight, after an employee had come forward on Monday “reporting behavior in violation of our company’s standards.” Guthrie’s voice trembled as the camera captured the tableau—Guthrie and her guest co-anchor, Hoda Kotb, palpably sombre, the Popsicle-orange “Today” show logo floating between them. Guthrie clasped Kotb’s hand. She read the entirety of a statement from the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, which was composed in the corporate “we”: “we” had reason to believe that the employee’s complaint wasn’t an isolated incident; “we were deeply saddened by this turn of events”; “we will face it together as a news organization—and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.” Then Guthrie and Kotb offered their personal expressions of shock and dismay. Lauer had been loved by so many; “we” loved him. “As I’m sure you can imagine, we are devastated,” Guthrie said. “We’re trying to process it and make sense of it, and it’ll take some time for that,” Kotb said. Expressions of disorientation not dissimilar from expressions of mourning continued for the rest of the show. As Rebecca Traister wrote earlier this month, a “powerful white man losing a job is a death.”  We have witnessed a theatre of accountability insidiously refine itself, quite quickly, in the past few months. Louis C.K.’s statement, for example, following the exposé in the Times of his sexual harassment of female comics, was not as passionate as, but was more coherent than, Harvey Weinstein’s ramblings about Jay-Z and the gun lobby. The opportunistic finesse of Kevin Spacey’s coming-out certainly tripped some social alarms, but he nonetheless garnered some sympathy. Power brokers like the Pixar animation baron John Lasseter have even scooped long-labored-over articles by preëmpting them altogether. (Lasseter is taking a six-month leave of absence.) No display was savvier than NBC’s orchestration on Wednesday.  The “Today” show’s artful transposition of grief where there would naturally be scrutiny continued into the 10 A.M. slot, in which the veteran host Kathie Lee Gifford spoke of how much she, too, loved Lauer and how sad she was. It continued on this morning’s program, with Guthrie and Kotb again at the helm. Not since Bill Cosby—or Bill O’Reilly, depending on one’s television diet—has the scourge of sexual assault so acutely infiltrated the righteous perimeter of the American home. (President Trump, also affiliated with NBC and accused of assaulting women, never quite depended on a family-man image.) The influence of a behind-the-scenes figure like Weinstein can feel diffuse, removed from our everyday cultural consumption; Lauer was, and is, synonymous with the family feel of “Today.” Part of this comes from the network’s bloated investment in Lauer—he reportedly earns between twenty million and twenty-five million dollars a year. (In 2014, a source told Page Six that the company chartered helicopter rides for Lauer from his Hamptons compound to its Rockefeller Center studios at his request.) When, in 1996, Lauer wrested the anchor chair from Bryant Gumbel, gossip magazines swooned over his geometric jaw and feathery hair; twenty years later, he was transforming comfortably into a smug but wise paternal figure. His tenure at the “Today” show was the longest in its history. Now instances of Lauer’s public pettiness toward women seem like the exertions of a holistically awful campaign. In 2012, he admonished the actress Anne Hathaway for photographs that the paparazzi had taken of her exiting a car. “Seen a lot of you lately,” he said. And, famously, Lauer was an architect of “Operation Bambi,” a plan that succeeded in getting his former co-anchor Ann Curry fired from the show that same year. (“ ‘Chemistry,’ in television history, generally means the man does not want to work with the woman,” Curry said, according to Brian Stelter’s insider anatomy, “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.”) On her final show, Curry wept and Lauer pretended to soothe her. His interview of Hillary Clinton last year was intrusive and aggressive when compared with his handling of Trump. How a man thinks of women dictates how he works with them.  The stakes with Lauer, as with Charlie Rose, who was fired from both CBS and PBS last week, for sexual harassment, threaten the geniality and social integrity that are the trade of the morning-show apparatus. And so it is no surprise that, to convey something like moral mooring to a vastly female audience, the networks rely on women anchors to break the public fall. An ether of remorse already fogs the perception of Lauer’s ousting, though Lauer waited a day to issue a statement and in it said, “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.” It seems likely that, at least when it comes to the fact of Lauer’s firing, Guthrie had truly been caught off guard. The company, however, wasn’t; reporters at Variety and the Times had spent months investigating claims against Lauer. Guthrie’s vulnerable pose conferred an unearned armament to a company that had employed a reckless man for two decades. The woman anchor’s surprise becomes the network’s surprise; her sorrow, its sorrow. “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they behaved badly?” Guthrie asked, her eyes glassy. For her, and for Gayle King, who asked a similar question when reporting on her co-host Rose’s transgressions last week, on CBS, the question of loyalty may be relevant. (It was Lauer who lobbied for Guthrie’s co-anchorship, in 2012, following the success of “Operation Bambi.”) But neither love nor loyalty nor sadness excuses NBC, the company that passed on its own employee’s reportage of Weinstein’s abuse of women. The Variety report on Lauer, published on Wednesday afternoon, included accounts of harassment from three unnamed women. It showed an emboldened player whose harmful wiles were accommodated by the network around him. The news mediates the news.  One detail from Ramin Setoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister’s reporting in Variety mentions a contraption, apparently common in the offices of executives of his stature, that in this context sounds like something used by a villain from a Bond film. The installation of a button under Lauer’s desk made it possible for him to lock himself, and anyone else who might have been invited into his office, inside, without getting up from his seat. The Times reported that NBC on Wednesday had received at least two more complaints from employees about Lauer’s behavior. One woman told the Times that Lauer locked her in his office in 2001: “She said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her.” She passed out and was taken to a nurse by Lauer’s assistant. Reading the article, I wondered who had seen that commotion, and I thought about the lock, an instrument of security turned into an instrument of violence.	1
Rachel Brosnahan is sharing fond memories of her late aunt, Kate Spade.  On Wednesday, the star of the Amazon series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel paid tribute to the influential designer, née Katherine Noel Brosnahan, who was found dead at 55 from apparent suicide in her N.Y.C. apartment one day prior. Brosnahan shared a video of Kate dancing with her husband Andy Spade (brother of actor David Spade) with a big smile on her face as a mariachi band played in the background.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered,” wrote the 27-year-old actress. “She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent.”  She added, “Hug your loved ones extra tight today.”  After Brosnahan won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a television series, musical or comedy for her work in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in January, Kate told Page Six that the family was “insanely proud.”  “I am beside myself! My daughter and I jumped up and down when she won,” the beloved handbag creator said. “She deserves this recognition, as she’s put her heart and soul into the role. We are insanely proud.”  Kate Spade and Rachel Brosnahan Walter McBride/Getty  Police confirmed Kate was found Tuesday morning in her bedroom at her and Andy’s Park Avenue home in Manhattan. A housekeeper discovered her, according to a police source, and she left a suicide note.  RELATED: Kate Spade’s Groundbreaking Career: A Look Back at the Designer’s Most Major Milestones  “We are all devastated by today’s tragedy,” her family said in a statement to the New York Daily News. “We loved Kate dearly and will miss her terribly.

Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard,” wrote David.  “I still can’t believe it.

Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)  Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online.  In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes.  That changed dramatically the following month.  Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before.  Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.”  “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.”  And viewers did, apparently.    Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst)  Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.”  “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said.  Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.  Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)  [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly]  But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.  “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.”  Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.  [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?]  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported.  The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain.  On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel.  “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.”  [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’]  Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products.  According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.  “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.”  Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)  The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.  [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals]  The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.  1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here’s a look at Ivanka Trump’s early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.  The companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.  Still, despite the boycott, Trump’s line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon’s best-selling list last month, The Post’s Amy B Wang reported. The Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum spray was the top-selling item in the “Perfumes & Fragrances” category.

"(CNN) The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won't -- for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn't seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.  The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall — and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means — and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months — that, ultimately, this isn't a legal fight, it's a public relations one.  Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,"" Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.  ""My version"" vs. ""their version."" What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the ""versions"" will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other ""version"" will be Giuliani's cable TV appearances and President Trump's tweets.  That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion -- particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump's side."	1

She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School—nicknamed ""Celebrity High""—before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour.

Best Director: “Manchester by the Sea”  “I think I knew I had something special when the cast came together. And then I guess that first screening I understood that people related to the film like this. To me it’s one of the greatest performances. Casey [Affleck] really nailed it. Me and Casey just tried to focus on what is happening with that character and what he’s trying to do and what is getting in his way. It sounds kind of simple cause you do that with every character. But this character is dealing with a terrible loss while also trying to figure out to function. And I think Casey is so good at narrowing those waters, and always asked the right questions about the character. I didn’t really need to say that much.

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

"In Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot found the role model she'd always wanted to play.  The DC superhero movie star was presented the second ever #SeeHer Award at the Critics' Choice Awards on Thursday, which honors more accurate portrayals of women in film. Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins presented Gadot with the award, who went on to address Time's Up and the current movement of women speaking out with their stories of sexual harassment and called for more women leading films -- and in the director's chair.  ""Throughout my career, I was asked to describe my dream role, and it was clear to me that I wanted to play a strong and independent woman. A real one,"" the Israeli actress shared. ""When I started acting, there were very few female-led movies and even fewer female directors.""  ""In the past weeks and months, we've been witnessing a movement within our industry and society,"" Gadot continued. ""We will band together to make strides, uniting for equality.""  Gadot follows in the footsteps of Viola Davis, who won the first award at last year's show.  Watch the video below for more of what Gadot has said about the Time's Up initiative.

"She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family.  ""There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,"" said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to ""be masculine"" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a ""tyranny by the minority.""  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the ""new director"" of the Academy's ""minority outreach program.""  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her ""goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.""  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state's 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California's 43rd District.  ""After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" Dash said in her statement. ""I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.""  She added that she knows her ""political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable."""	0

Roseanne ended with more twists than an episode of This Is Us. In the series finale, Roseanne (Roseanne Barr) revealed she had rewritten a lot of her story. Sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) was a lesbian, her daughters were with each other’s spouses and Dan (John Goodman) died after his heart attack. The character dictated her story. Forget about that.  At the 2017 TCA Summer Press Tour, Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, revealed some of those twists are going away.  “I’m not going to talk too specifically about the season,” Dungey said about the finale reveals. “I wouldn’t say that it’s ignoring the events of the finale, but I can say that Dan is definitely alive.”	0
While Jennifer has often talked about how challenging she finds the constant speculation about why she doesn’t have children, she’s always been very frank about wanting a baby.

I did and I do and I will!’  But in 2015 while still married to Justin Theroux, she hinted they were struggling with conception, telling The Hollywood Reporter: ‘Who knows if it’s going to happen? It’s been  While the actress has an uncertain future ahead of her with former flame Brad Pitt, 54, she has said previously she doesn’t ‘have to settle with a man’ to have a kid.

Related: Jen Aniston pregnant with Brad Pitt's baby  New Idea  Jennifer, who is currently filming the Netflix movie Murder Mystery alongside Adam Sandler, has rekindled a relationship with Brad Pitt, but has always indicated she would happily go it alone as a single mum if the opportunity arose.  Back in 2010 she pointed out: ‘Women are realising it more and more, knowing that they don’t have to settle with a man just to have that child.’  A pregnancy couldn’t come at a better time for Jennifer.  As New Idea reported last week, the former Friends star has been increasingly stressed about her career, and after watching the drama of her ex Brad’s divorce and custody battle with Angelina Jolie, has been fearful about her future.  But now, even though there are challenges ahead, Jennifer couldn’t be happier.  ‘Despite being warned that at 49 her chances of falling pregnant were slim, a miracle may happen,’ adds the source.  ‘She’s getting help from a top fertility doctor in Beverly Hills, who she describes as a ‘magician’ and she hopes all her dreams come true.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea, on sale now!	1
"Undertaking a 50-city tour is a daunting task for anyone, especially when you have a toddler.  Peta Murgatroyd and Maks Chmerkovskiy — who are parents to son Shai Aleksander, 16 months on Friday — are currently traveling across the country on their Maks & Val & Peta: Confidential tour, which they’re performing in alongside Chmerkovskiy’s younger brother and fellow Dancing With the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The couple has little Shai along with them for the ride, but performing for crowds nationwide multiple times a week means that certain sacrifices have to be made when it comes to spending time with their little boy.  “It’s very hard,” Murgatroyd, 31, told PEOPLE during a Hilton Honors member experience dance class of balancing the tour with getting enough time with Shai. “I didn’t think it would be easy but I just am obsessed with my son, so I want to spend so much time with him.”  “It’s a lot of responsibility — [making sure] he doesn’t eat anything on the floor,” jokes Chmerkovskiy, 38, adding, “We’ve put together a bit of an infrastructure to support the fact that he is here.

Khloé Kardashian, just welcomed her first child — a baby girl! — amid rampant speculation about Tristan Thompson‘s alleged infidelities.  A source previously told PEOPLE that though Kardashian, 33, was devastated, she would remain focused on motherhood, explaining that the scandal “doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom.”  It’s also not the first time the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star has faced similar rumors. Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom.  A source close to Odom, 38, told PEOPLE recently that “Lamar feels terrible for Khloé. He wasn’t sure if he should reach out and see how she’s doing. He feels for her.”  Kardashian and Odom wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Watch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.  Cheating rumors against Odom first circulated in January 2012, when a tabloid report claimed Odom cheated on Kardashian with a woman he met at a Washington, D.C., strip club. And in July 2013, the pair were confronted rumors claiming Odom had been unfaithful to Kardashian after playing a game for the Dallas Mavericks.  RELATED: Everything We Know About Khloé Kardashian’s Romance with Tristan Thompson (So Far)  JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  “Love is blind … Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I’m this princess. I never speculated cheating … so I didn’t know about cheating … until before the DUI [in 2013],” Kardashian told Howard Stern in January 2016.  “He was so good. So nothing was on his cell phones, [but] he had an assistant. They were all on his assistant’s phone, so he was really crafty,” she recalled as Stern asked the former Kocktails with Khloé host: “Doesn’t that feel awful when the assistant knows, and everyone knows?” To which Kardashian agreed, “Oh, it’s disgusting.”  RELATED GALLERY: Khloé Kardashian & Lamar Odom: A Timeline of Their Relationship  “But all these rumors kept coming out in the weeklies, and as much as I know they’re bull—-, where there’s smoke there’s fire. Something has to be right here,” Kardashian revealed. “It is humiliating on any level, but I found out he was cheating on me the majority of our marriage, I just didn’t know.”  In October 2015, Odom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Near death, he spent four days in a coma, and Kardashian rushed to his side and called off their divorce proceedings temporarily.  Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty; JB Lacroix/WireImage  Months before, in July 2015, both stars had signed divorce papers, but the judgment had not yet been entered in court by the time Odom was hospitalized; thus, they were technically still legally married. As a result, Kardashian was making all of Odom’s medical decisions.  Upon his recovery, Odom completed a 30-day drug rehab program.  Khloé refiled for divorce once Odom recovered from the Nevada incident, and their split was finalized in December 2016.  RELATED: Khloé Kardashian Opens Up About Lamar Odom’s Harrowing Ordeal: I’ll Always Be There for Him  RELATED VIDEO: Khloé Kardashian’s BFF Khadijah Haqq Takes Aim at Tristan Thompson During Cheating Scandal  In July 2017, Odom penned an emotional first-person essay for The Players’ Tribune in which he touched on how his drug addiction and infidelity tore apart his marriage.  “Anybody who’s lived a complicated, drug-infused life like I’ve lived knows the cycle — with women, cheating on my wife, s— like that,” he wrote.  Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  One of his “darkest” moments, he admitted, was when Kardashian caught him doing drugs with another woman. “I was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom. First of all I was in a motel. A motel,” he remembered.  “I’m a millionaire. I’d made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I’m in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn’t take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag,” he wrote.  Odom still thinks highly of Kardashian. Asked in January by BET’s Mancave about Khloé being pregnant, Odom said he’s “happy for her,” adding, “She took care of me, she’ll be a good mother. For real. She’s a great woman.”  Now, a source told PEOPLE that when Kardashian got together with Thompson, her sisters were “really happy to see Khloe so excited about someone again because she hadn’t felt that way about a guy since Lamar. Eventually Tristan won over her family too … he really seemed dedicated to her, so this must be a shock to everyone.”	1
"Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'  Shakira kicks off the North American leg of Her El Dorado World Tour at United Center on Aug. 3, 2018 in Chicago.  Shakira fans waited long enough to see the Colombian superstar touring and back onstage in the United States -- seven years to be exact. And for some fans, like Joel and Karen, it was the first time they got to see Shakira live.  “We drove eight hours from Minnesota just to see her,” said the couple. “We’ve been waiting since the '90s to see Shakira. I want to sing the oldies with her."" ""I’ve been practicing in my shower for the last 20 years,” added Karen.  After a successful run in Europe earlier this summer, Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado Tour at the United Center in Chicago on Friday (Aug. 3). The tour was rescheduled from January after the singer/songwriter had to postpone her international trek due to strained vocal chords.  “It’s so good to see you,” Shakira said after singing her first couple of songs, including “Estoy Aquí,” “She Wolf” and “Si Te Vas.”  “It’s been way too long,"" she continued. ""I’ve been dreaming about this moment. There were times when all of this seemed impossible, but miracles do exist. You made this happen! Thank you for all your support, especially in these last few months.""  Not only did Shakira sing her heart out -- in English and Spanish -- for nearly two hours and delivered classics like “Inevitable,” “Tú” and “Antología” and her most recent hits such as “Me Enamoré” and “Chantaje,” she also danced all night long. Even as mother of two, those hips still don’t lie.  Working the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue, the hypnotizing and infectious hip moves came when the chart-topping artist sang tracks like “Perro Fiel,” “Dare (La La La),” “Waka Waka” and “Loca.”  Of course, the sexy, upbeat tracks called for a change in wardrobe and for those, Shakira appeared onstage with her staple belly dancing wraps covered with beads and coins that really accentuated her hip-swiveling moves.  Two special guests spotted in the crowd were Shakira’s sons: Milan and Sasha. The two almost stole the show when they were ushered to their front row seats where they would see their mamá in all her glory. From the stage and throughout the show, she blew kisses their way.  Another fan favorite moment was when Shakira appeared on the other side of the venue wearing a long, gold dress to sing “Toneladas” and right after, made her way back to the main stage walking in the middle of the crowd and stopping to snap a few selfies and greet fans who threw themselves at her as she passed by.  The grand finale was a succession of hits, including “Rabiosa,” “Hips Don’t Lie,” “La Tortura” and “La Bicicleta.” It reminded us of how vast Shakira's catalog is, and how enduring the hits are, even after a seven-year wait.  “First night in the U.S., incredible,” she wrote on social media immediately after the concert. “Thank you, Chicago.”"	0
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)	0
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Randee Dawn  Carrie Underwood has set her sights on some serious goals. Hockey goals, that is!  That's because the Nashville Predators, for which her husband Mike Fisher is both center and captain, are currently battling it out in the Stanley Cup Finals!  And they're doing quite well; as of Monday night, the team was tied 2-2 in the series against the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Perhaps that has something to do with Underwood, who's been the biggest cheerleader of them all, posting pictures and videos on Instagram where she's decked out in Predators buttons, jersey and a hat.  Let's not forget the special mani-pedi!  She's also been making friends with at least one hockey legend: Wayne Gretzky.  We already know the Underwood/Fisher household is full of Predators fans. These days, the toddler attends games to watch daddy play, was there for his dad's 1,000th game, and Underwood even sang the national anthem before a game in April.  But having a shot at winning the Cup is a whole other level of excitement, which might explain why there was no time to do anything about Fisher's 37th birthday on Monday night.

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom. He and Kate Middleton are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, not the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.	0

"President Donald Trump‘s use of Twitter has long been a controversial component of his presidency, in part because of his frequent use of the “block” button, which the president has unleashed on a number of notable actors, authors and activists who have used Twitter as a platform to criticize him and his administration.  But his critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment — because his Twitter feed is an official government account.  “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,” model and author Chrissy Teigen, whom Trump blocked in July 2017, tweeted Wednesday after the judge’s ruling was announced.  According to The New York Times, seven Twitter users and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sued the president, claiming Trump’s account is part of the government and blocking them violates their First Amendment rights.  Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald agreed with the plaintiffs, noting in her ruling that “the speech in which they seek to engage is protected by the First Amendment.” She also wrote that Trump and White House social media director Dan Scavino “exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account.”  well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WajEXiAQVi — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 23, 2018  Here’s a running list of notable people who have received the “@arealDonaldTrump blocked you” message on Twitter — but should be able to read his tweets again soon:  1. Laura Packard  Packard, a small business owner from Las Vegas who is currently battling stage four Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, was blocked by Trump after tweeting at him about health care and concerns over the repeal of Obamacare. The tweets that seemed to push Trump over the edge are from Sept. 19 of last year, in which she accused him of putting “America last,” and questioned him over the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.  Don't you mean put America last? https://t.co/8tTxFjdYIw — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Your latest TrumpCare bill would mean 32M Americans will lose their health insurance. What about putting them first? https://t.co/wPObZisLQp — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Omg. The President of the United States just personally blocked me. pic.twitter.com/MgLfwufOXC — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 20, 2017  The morning of Sept. 20, she woke up and discovered that Trump had blocked her. Now, she has one request for Trump, she told ThinkProgress — and it isn’t that he’ll lift the block: “I just wish that he would listen.”  But Packard addressed Wednesday’s ruling, helpfully explaining how Trump can unblock users en masse.  Oh hai @realdonaldtrump! If you need to unblock thousands (tens of thousands?) of people in a hurry, perhaps due to court order, you can do it 1 by 1 but it's a lot easier to use https://t.co/HswTF8YZED and then do mass unblocking. — Laura Packard (@lpackard) May 23, 2018  2. Rosie O’Donnell  Trump and O’Donnell have been feuding for years, but it took until July 23, 2017, for him to finally block her on Twitter. It was a tweet that mentioned the instantly infamous unsubstantiated Russian dossier, which alleged that Russian spies had explicit information about Trump, which finally prompted him to block the former talk show host  on ur back ? dear god don – the russians bought their train ticket – u r confused -prostitutes peeed on ur back in moscow @realDonaldTrump — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 23, 2017  Just a few hours after sending the tweet, O’Donnell found herself blocked.  awww @realdonaldtrump – i get it – its too tough to read the truth … poor baby – i understand don – u take care of u – friend #BLOCKED pic.twitter.com/EQxnZarnhE — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 24, 2017  She’s still tweeting about him, though — and has asked others to forward along her messages.  3. Anne Rice  I've been blocked from Trump's twitter site. Hilarious. This after a few responses to his tweets! Wow. I'm amazed! Truly amazed. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  Maybe I'll be personally attacked next. One can always hope. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  And I so relished responding personally to Trump's tweets. Ah well… — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  The president denied the Interview With the Vampire author one of her favorite pastimes — personally responding to Trump’s many tweets. She frequently tweeted about the president, his policy decisions, and yes, his tweets. In fact, it’s almost all she tweets about even now, after she’s been blocked. It was a now-deleted tweet about the Republican health care plan that finally got her banned from his account on June 26.  Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty  The tweet read:  “The Trump-GOP health care plan is a tax cut for the rich. Millions will lose coverage. A complete rip off.”  Now, like O’Donnell, Rice hopes that her messages will still find their way to Trump through her followers.  Already been smeared by the right. Please RT this to Trump. He's blocked me. https://t.co/jvnIKnJDsj — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) August 13, 2017  4. Chrissy Teigen  After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ""lol no one likes you"" was the straw pic.twitter.com/MhZ6bXT1Dp — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 25, 2017  The latest addition to the “blocked by Trump” club, Teigen is an outspoken critic of the president, and has been, in her own words, for “nine years” — long before he ever ran for the White House. What was the insult though, that pushed Trump to hit the block button? According to Teigen, it was her most recent attack, on Sunday:  Lolllllll no one likes you — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 23, 2017  Teigen shared a screenshot of the notification that Trump had blocked her, writing: “After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ‘lol no one likes you’ was the straw.”  Francois Mori/AP  5. Stephen King  Trump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017  He’s an expert on twists and turns, but not even King could have predicted that the president would block him on Twitter. Before the block, in mid-June, King had frequently tweeted criticisms of Trump, but rarely tagged the president’s twitter accounts (@realDonaldTrump or @POTUS). However, there were some pretty tough-worded tweets, so it’s possible they ended up on Trump’s radar.  Donald Trump: A remarkable combination of unhinged and dumb as dirt. Time to start talking impeachment. Really. Enough is enough. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 10, 2017  Trump's tweets in his first hundred days draw a pretty clear portrait: he's an almost textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 4, 2017  With President Forrest Trump, every day is like a rancid box of chocolates. You never know what kind of shit you're going to get next. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 11, 2017  6. Marina Sirtis  I've been blocked by our Prez !! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  The actress and Star Trek: The Next Generation star can pinpoint her blockage to a single tweet. The whole thing happened pretty quickly. First, she tweeted this on May 8:  @realDonaldTrump threatening to go to WAR to deflect from Russiagate!! Willing to let our boys die to save his sorry ass! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  Six minutes later, she tweeted that she had been blocked. Sometimes, these things happen fast.  7. Bess Kalb  OH. MY. EFFING. GOD.  The President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/oB5zTAs7In — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017  A writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The New Yorker, Kelb found herself blocked by the president after a posting a number of tweets about him, as well as regular responses to many of his tweets. She said she was blocked because she “hurt his feelings.” There’s no telling which of Kelb’s tweets was the final straw for Trump, but here are a number of guesses:  Trump is the funniest example of why you should always be nice to the makeup lady. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  The President of the United States of America just picked a twitter fight with Rosie O'Donnell. https://t.co/yYwVbq74Sh — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 11, 2017  Oh boy, honey. I've tried to lay off and let you President like you said you would, but this is a new kind of simplistic nonsense rhetoric. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  8. Andy Signore  INSANITY!! – The @POTUS @realdonaldtrump can't take my tweets criticizing his reign, so they BLOCKED me 😂😂 I have a theory about this (1of8) pic.twitter.com/KcW7JdFpd8 — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 5, 2017  Signore is the mastermind behind the YouTube channel Honest Trailers. What’s surprising is that Signore wasn’t a habitual tweet-at-Trump-er. Instead, he wrote one critical tweet, about Trump misconstruing a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on the terror attack at London Bridge.  I am so damn sick of bully @realDonaldTrump taking words out of context to act out his agenda of fear, corruption & bigotry. #NotMyPresident — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 4, 2017  By the next night, he was blocked.  9. Angelo Carusone  Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now? pic.twitter.com/KBGG3YKfvf — Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) June 15, 2017  Trump’s blocking of Carusone, the president of the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America, left him at a loss.  Carusone said he hadn’t tweeted at Trump in four months by the time the president blocked him on June 15.  “Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now?” Carusone wrote.  10. Holly Figueroa O’Reilly  Who says Trump doesn't read our tweets? 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/SQ8mb06InR — Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 29, 2017  Songwriter O’Reilly, who was also one of the organizers of the #MarchForTruth calling for an independent probe into the Trump administration’s possible ties to the Russian government, found herself blocked by Trump at the end of May. She’s tweeted a number of insults at Trump, including the following:  Did you seriously use your 11-year-old son, Barron Trump, as a political shield? You are the biggest f'ing coward.#TuesdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wswdoBTsM7 — Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) July 25, 2017  O’Reilly, however, isn’t taking Trump’s blockage lightly. She, along with six other blocked-by-Trump Twitter users, as well as the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, have sued Trump, saying that the blocking is “unconstitutional” and seeking to remove it, according to court documents."	1
This meme — the notion that in 2016 actor Denzel Washington publicly supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump — is an example of a false claim that has evolved over time as it has spread across social media and on a variety of unreliable websites. Other iterations of this rumor falsely quoted Washington as saying that when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, “we avoided a war with Russia, and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state.”  This rumor first went viral in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. It resurfaced in February 2018 when Washington was nominated for an Oscar — and appeared yet again in April 2018, after musician Kanye West tweeted a statement of support for Trump, reigniting longstanding discussions about the political loyalties of black American voters.  Insight: Viral rumors often recirculate when new contexts for them emerge.  What can we learn?  Let’s start with an instance of this viral meme that was included in a post on a highly suspect website — USALibertyPress.com — in February 2018:  Note: The link in the previous paragraph is to an archive of the “fake news” website. That avoids linking to the site itself and giving it additional web traffic and ad revenue.  The first step we should take is to do a little lateral reading on the claim itself. So let’s do a quick search:  All the top results for this search are from fact-checking organizations, so we can safely assume that this is a questionable claim. A quick read of the fact checks confirms that the claims in both the headline and the meme on the Liberty Press website are false. PolitiFact traced the headline claim to a well-known “fake news” website, YourNewsWire.com, and Snopes shows that the quote attributed to Washington was actually said by Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, in an interview with the New York Post.  Note: Like pieces of quality journalism, good fact checks and debunking articles are transparent. They don’t ask you to trust them; they show you why you should trust them.  But this still leaves us with questions about the source of the information. The source we started with is USALibertyPress.com, so let’s begin there.  Since the site does not have an “About” section — a red flag in itself — we can try to see who might have established it by searching the WHOIS registry, a database of website registration information.  Tool: WHOIS is a database of website domain registration information that you can search using any number of free portals, such as whois.net and GoDaddy’s WHOIS search portal.  A quick search for “USALibertyPress.com” on GoDaddy’s WHOIS search portal gave us this*:  As the highlighted areas show, this site was registered by someone at an address in Veles, Macedonia — a hub for “fake news” purveyors. A quick search for Veles confirms its infamy:  We now have all we need to confirm that not only is this a false claim, but at least one website pushing it is part of a network of “fake news” sites based in Macedonia.  Finally, you could use Google Street View to see the physical address in Veles that was used to register this site:  There is quite a bit more you could do with this example — see this tweet thread for more ideas — but these three steps (reading laterally for additional information, searching the WHOIS registry for a website’s origin and using Google Street View to check out the location) are important skills that will help you sort fact from fiction in the future.  *UPDATE (Aug. 28, 2018): The domain registration for www.usalibertypress.com was updated on July 28, 2018, and no longer includes information about the registrant in Macedonia. The site itself is now offline.	1
"No. Title Directed by Written by Original air date US viewers  (millions)  1 ""Pilot"" Paul McGuigan Michele Fazekas & Tara Butters October 3, 2017 ( ) 4.17[5]  After getting fired from his Wall Street job and surviving a suicide attempt, Kevin Finn returns to his hometown to live with his twin sister Amy, a widowed mom, and her teenage daughter Reese. While Amy is away at a work assignment, a meteor crashes to earth near her home. Kevin and Reese investigate, and when Kevin touches the meteorite, he is hurtled backward. He begins having strange visions, including a mysterious woman named Yvette that only Kevin can see. Yvette calls herself one of God's messengers, tasked with locating the 36 righteous souls of this generation, of which Kevin is the only one known to be left.  Yvette tells Kevin that not even she knows what happened to the other 35 righteous ones, and that they'll have to let the universe guide them. She explains that Kevin needs to strengthen his soul by performing good deeds. While helping the son of a brewery pub owner find his true path, Kevin reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Kristin and the two sleep together. They ponder getting back together, but both remember how badly Kevin treated Kristin in the past and decide it's not a good idea. Kevin has a vision of an island surrounded by ocean.  3 ""Sweet Little Lies"" Peter Leto Chris Dingess & Davah Avena October 17, 2017 ( ) 3.26[7]  Kevin tries to intervene as a wedding planner for Deb, whose former childhood friend proposed to her when she got cancer. But now that Deb is healthy, she reveals to Kevin that she does not want to get married. Kevin has a vision of a mariachi band. Yvette meets with Ava, a celestial messenger like herself. Ava says she will gather all the other messengers to meet about finding the rest of the righteous, but come meeting time, they are the only two to show up. Ava then says that she too is giving up.  4 ""How to be Good"" J. Miller Tobin Teleplay by: Brant Englestein  Story by: Michele Fazekas & Tara Butters October 24, 2017 ( ) 2.87[8]  Kevin helps Lucille, Tyler's rude boss at the diner, and gets dragged into a feud between Lucille and her estranged sister, Anne. Kevin later has a vision of being in an Asian marketplace. Reese confronts Kevin about the strange things she's observed, and asks if the meteorite gave him superpowers.  5 ""Brutal Acts of Kindness"" Rob Hardy Craig DiGregorio October 31, 2017 ( ) 2.71[9]  After Yvette convinces him to withdraw his entire $30,000 severance pay and give it away, Kevin helps a woman who cannot afford her son's diabetes medication. He later has a vision of being chased by a tiger through a jungle. Amy finds Reese's journal and sees that Kevin caused Reese to be thrown in jail. She angrily tells Kevin to pack up and move out.  6 ""Rocky Road"" Wendey Stanzler Jack Kenny November 7, 2017 ( ) 2.91[10]  Kevin begins looking for places to stay, hitting up Tyler, Kristin and Nathan. He also helps a man who lost his job 18 months ago look for work, learning that the man never told his wife and has now exhausted their life savings. Angry at her mom, Reese skips school and runs away to an abandoned factory. Kevin and Amy arrive to talk her down, but Reese slips from her perch and falls. Yvette suspends Reese in mid air for a couple of seconds, allowing Kevin to get underneath and catch her. A dumbfounded Amy observes, and starts seeing Kevin the way Reese has seen him. Kevin gets a printout of all his previous visions, plus a new one of mountaintops in the clouds.  7 ""Dave"" Ron Underwood Chris Dingess November 14, 2017 ( ) 2.62[11]  Kevin and Yvette are joined by Dave (Will Sasso), another celestial messenger, who helps them on Kevin's next assignment. The assignment turns out to be helping Kristin's cancer-stricken mother Susan (Anjali Bhimani) find some joy while living out her last days. Kevin later sees a vision of a flaming gazebo. Meanwhile, Amy wants to use science to figure out what she witnessed when Reese fell, and soon meets Iggy (Brandon Quinn), a theology professor who tries to convince her that it's okay for some things to remain unexplained. Also, Nathan tells Reese he wants to ask Amy out on a date, but Reese will not give him permission.  8 ""Chrysalis"" Metin Hüseyin Kevin Deiboldt December 5, 2017 ( ) 2.62[12]  Kevin sees a vision of blue butterflies, and follows one to an art class held by Ethan (Enoch King). Kevin offers to help Ethan get over his fear of rejection by taking him to an art show, later realizing this will conflict with Reese's school play. Dave appears and reveals himself to Ethan, offering to take him to the art showing so Kevin can be with his family. At the same time, Yvette meets with Ava, who tells her that Dave has turned all the celestial messengers against her. Kevin angrily confronts Yvette about being able to reveal herself to other people, and asks what else she's hidden from him. Yvette admits she does not know if the other 35 righteous really exist, and is operating on faith alone. Kevin chooses to work with Dave, which backfires when Ethan gets scared and backs out of the show. Kevin returns to Yvette while making things right with Ethan by setting up a surprise showing of Ethan's paintings. Ethan offers a painting of a blue butterfly to Kevin as a thank you, also telling Kevin about a trip he took that inspired it. Kevin now knows where the next righteous soul will be found. Elsewhere, Kristin helps Amy prepare for her first date with Iggy, but later notices that Amy will not tell Nathan about the date.  9 ""Probably"" Tamra Davis Michele Fazekas & Tara Butters December 12, 2017 ( ) 2.49[13]  Kevin travels to Laos, taking Tyler along. The two are befriended by Vong (David Huynh), whom Kevin and Yvette briefly think is the next righteous but he's not. Kevin sees another of his visions and wants to press on, but Yvette now has doubts and thinks Dave may have been right. Yvette appears as human and is approached by Tyler, who finds her fascinating. The two dance to a mariachi band (another of Kevin's earlier visions), which renews Yvette's faith. Kevin and Tyler, with help from Lucille on video chat, then help Vong's wife deliver their first child, and it turns out the baby is the next righteous soul. Back at home, Reese tells Amy that Nathan wanted to ask her out. Amy meets Nathan the next day and tells him about Iggy, but says she now knows she wasn't yet ready to date and is glad she realized this with someone she doesn't truly care about. Nathan later does something special for Amy.  10 ""The Ugly Sleep"" J. Miller Tobin Davah Avena January 2, 2018 ( ) 2.62[14]  Kevin helps Charlie (Trent Garrett), who is despondent over a recent breakup, meet someone new, but when the someone new turns out to be Kristin, it leads to awkwardness. The situation causes Charlie to realize the girl he left is his one true love, and he returns to her. Inspired by Kevin's good deeds, Reese befriends a new girl at school who is struggling to fit in. Meanwhile, Yvette sees that Tyler is still smitten over her and tries to figure out a way to help him move on. Kevin has a vision of a snow-covered area in the woods. As the episode closes, Kristin tells Kevin that she submitted his name for an open substitute teacher position.  11 ""Solo"" Lee Rose Kevin Deiboldt January 9, 2018 ( ) 2.39[15]  On his first day as a substitute teacher, Kevin encounters an introverted kid named Adam and extracts information about who will be the target of the annual ""Freshman Prank"". After Adam reveals the target is Kristin, he becomes even more disliked for squealing. Kevin tries to help Adam become noticed for something else -- namely, pulling off the most legendary Freshman Prank since the one Kevin engineered 20 years ago. Meanwhile, Amy and Nathan have an awkward first date, but later enjoy helping Kevin, Adam and Tyler as they plan the prank. Kevin has a vision of being on the deck of a crabbing boat.  12 ""Caught White-Handed"" Jennifer Lynch Brant Englestein January 16, 2018 ( ) 2.46[16]  Reese is with Kevin when he tracks his next subject, and she realizes her uncle has stumbled upon the mysterious ""acorn fairy"" -- a person who has been doing good deeds around Taylor for the last ten years. In trying to help the woman (Kathleen Wilhoite), Kevin unintentionally causes her real identity to be revealed, along with her criminal past. Meanwhile, Yvette learns that the person responding to Tyler's ads searching for her is Kevin, who says he was just trying to figure out a way to let his friend down easy. This backfires when Tyler decides to travel to Canada to locate his true love. Kevin has a vision of the boat from the previous episode, but this time Tyler is with him.  13 ""Fishtail"" J. Miller Tobin Craig DiGregorio & Chris Dingess February 6, 2018 ( ) 2.29[17]  Kevin tracks Tyler to Victoria, British Columbia, finding him working at a failing fish shop for a stubborn owner named Gus (Troy Evans), who refuses to update the shop in the modern marketplace that surrounds him. Kevin sees images from his fish boat vision, and determines the next righteous soul is in the vicinity. Elsewhere, Yvette reconnects with Dave to show him a cut on her finger and ask what it means. Dave later reveals a scrape on his leg. While Kevin and Tyler help Gus save his shop by developing an old-time fish tossing show, Kevin finds that the next righteous is Gus's landlord Shea (Sprague Grayden), who has done everything she can to keep the fish shop open. At Yvette's urging, Kevin tells Tyler the truth: that he wrote the emails from his ""true love"" to try and give him closure. Tyler decides that Kevin is no longer his friend.  14 ""Old Friends"" Michael Patrick Jann Chris Dingess & Craig DiGregorio February 20, 2018 ( ) 1.55[18]  As Kevin helps Amy with a task, he meets and helps Marc (Rhenzy Feliz), a 19-year old who has become a drifter after being estranged from his parents. Kevin also makes numerous attempts to win back Tyler's friendship, all of which fail until he gets Dave's help to see into Tyler's past. With further help from Kristin and Amy, Kevin makes a grand gesture to recreate a piece of Tyler's childhood. In the process, Kevin reconnects with Kristin romantically. While kissing her, he is startled by a vision of a bearded corpse in a coffin. Elsewhere, Yvette and Dave are continuing to develop human qualities, like getting ill and becoming hungry. As the episode closes, Dave gets electrocuted and disappears. Yvette confesses to Kevin that she has no idea where Dave went.  15 ""World's Worst Domino"" Peter Leto Brant Englestein & Davah Avena February 27, 2018 ( ) 2.11[19]  Amy hears something upstairs, which she thinks is a critter or intruder, but is actually Yvette. This causes Amy to install multiple security cameras. Yvette tells Kevin that Dave is likely dead, and that changes are happening to her. Meanwhile, Kevin helps Becky, the school security guard who was fired following the prank he helped engineer. It turns out Becky is a bit of an inventor, and with help from Amy and Tyler, Kevin is able to get her into a nearby inventor's expo. While the expo doesn't go well, Becky and Tyler fall for each other. As the episode concludes, Amy and Reese are reviewing security camera footage, and are startled by a brief, faint image of what appears to be a human talking to Kevin.  16 ""The Right Thing"" J.

Charlie Sheen has settled a lawsuit he filed against the National Enquirer over the publication’s report that the former “Two and a Half Men” star sodomized a then-13-year-old Corey Haim while the pair were filming the 1986 film “Lucas.”  A spokesman for Enquirer parent company AMI told TheWrap that the matter has been “amicably resolved.”  TheWrap has also reached out to Sheen’s legal representative for comment.  Also Read: Charlie Sheen Sues the National Enquirer Over Corey Haim Rape Story (Report)  According to TMZ, Sheen’s legal team filed papers late last week asking that the suit be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the suit can’t be filed again.  Sheen filed the suit in December, accusing the publication of defamation. The suit resulted from a Nov. 8 article that quoted former actor Dominick Brascia as saying Haim told him that Sheen and Haim “smoked pot and had sex. He said they had anal sex. Haim said after it happened Sheen became very cold and rejected him. When Corey wanted to fool around again, Charlie was not interested.”  In a statement released by his attorney, Shane Bernard, after the complaint was filed, Sheen said, “In my nearly 35 years as a celebrated entertainer, I have been nothing shy of a forthright, noble and valiant courier of the truth.”  Also Read: Corey Haim's Mother Says Charlie Sheen Sexual Assault Accusations Were 'All Made Up'  Sheen continued, “Consistently admitting and owning a laundry list of shortcomings, wrongdoings and indiscretions this traveler hath traveled — however, every man has a breaking point. These radically groundless and unfounded allegations end now. I now take a passionate stand against those who wish to even entertain the sick and twisted lies against me. GAME OVER.”	1
James Corden may be able to sing karaoke, but it’s Halle Berry who just came out with the digs! On the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of TBS’ new sketch show, Drop the Mic, which pins two celebs up against each other in an epic rap battle, both Berry and Corden got in some personal digs.  It all began with Berry’s career choices. “Let’s not pretend that Catwoman didn’t suck. Halle, that was a Batman movie, how’d you mess that up?” Corden began. However, she was ready!  “I’m glad Swordfish was to your satisfaction. It’s probably the only time your d-ck has seen some action,” she rapped. “Yes, everybody knows Catwoman tanked, but I took Kingsman to the mother f-ckin’ bank… James has a Tony, that’s cool and all. But I have an Oscar, so suck my monster balls.”  From there, he got personal.  “Halle is a classic. This whole thing’s tragic. You’re just Viola Davis but not as charismatic,” he rapped. “Sure you won an Oscar but I question the voters. I use my Gothica DVD as a drink coaster… 2008 you were Sexiest Woman Alive. Was that a moment when Beyoncé briefly died?”  The late night host ended with the divorce jokes, while she ended with a sex dig.  “When it comes to getting married, three divorces is enough. Forget signing autographs. Sign a prenup,” he said. “You’ve done so many X-Men movies, maybe a dozen. I heard X-Men and I thought it was about your husbands.”  “Now, why are you so angry and pushy? Of course, you hated Catwoman you never get p–sy,” Berry said.  In the end, she was named the clear winner.  Drop the Mic airs on TBS on Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET.

The video made it clear that Spears isn't herself when she's hungry.  Britney Spears and her boyfriend Sam Asghari posted a video on Wednesday night which gave fans a hilarious glimpse at what the singer is really like when she’s hungry. In the Instagram clip, Spears and Asghari start off walking hand in hand down a hallway. As they walk, you can hear Asghari complimenting Spears on her outfit. But then she interrupts him and asks where they’ll be eating. When he says “steakhouse,” she gets a goofy expression on her face and runs off, to which Asghari replies, “I think she’s really hungry.”  Spears confirmed that in the caption of her video.  “I was freaking hungry.” she wrote.  Britney Spears and Sam Asghari have often given fans behind the scenes peeks into their relationship via posts on Instagram. They’ve become known for their couples workout videos which show off their physical fitness and affection for each other. Britney also regularly shares heartwarming photos of them looking very much in love.  In the past, Asghari has said that he believes that they were brought together by fate. He was cast in her “Slumber Party” video in 2016 and he told Men’s Health that his inclusion in the taping was a last minute decision as they had already hired most of the other people who were in it.  “I got a call at midnight,” Asghari told Men’s Health in July.  “It went through so much to get to me. I don’t know if it’s some sort of a blessing or just meant to be.”  The Iranian-born model added that he tried to be funny with her after she introduced herself by pretending that he didn’t hear her name. It looks like the joke worked though because shortly after the video was released, the two were photographed together by paparazzi. Based on what Asghari said to Men’s Health, it looks like they started dating very soon after they met because, at one point, he reveals they never had any intention of being friends.  During the interview, Asghari raved about his popstar girlfriend, praising her for her humble nature and expressing gratitude for her presence in his life.  “She motivates me more than anyone,” Asghari continued.	0
HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP“Impeach!” It’s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama’s administration – but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it’s back with a vengeance.Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “I” word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America’s new Richard Nixon.“Watergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. “Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I’m not going to stop asking them.”Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.The posters read: “If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. … Resign now.”But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?At this time, there’s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.“The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,” Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him..

After escaping her reportedly intense marriage to mega-star Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes was probably looking for a sense of calm and stability in her next serious relationship.  But it’s questionable whether the “Dawson’s Creek” alum has found that with Jamie Foxx, with multiple reports suggesting that the Oscar-winning actor hasn’t been able to let go of his flirtatious, bachelor ways.  “No one understands why Katie loves a man who can’t seem to commit or why he’s publicly humiliating her like this,” an insider told Us magazine. “Everyone just wants her to take care of herself and to be happy. But she won’t let go of Jamie.”  Foxx, 50, sparked breakup rumors earlier this month when he was spotted partying in Miami with multiple women, while Holmes, 39, was in Paris for Fashion Week. Foxx also was seen getting close to his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis on July 4 when they watched fireworks together in Malibu. On top of that, the “Ray” actor was hit with allegations that he got rough with a woman during a sexual encounter in Las Vegas 2002 and tried to force her to have oral sex with him.  While TMZ reported that Foxx won’t face charges in that case because the statute of limitations had run out, Holmes is reportedly unhappy with his other behavior around women, Us magazine reported.  Nonetheless, Holmes is not ready to give up on the relationship, because she’s “absolutely smitten” with him, the insider told Us.  Page Six reported that Holmes was heard declaring her love for the “Django Unchained” actor after she boarded a flight to Paris. Suri, her 12-year-old daughter with Cruise, was with her, as was a friend and their nanny.  “Katie was FaceTiming Jamie after they boarded,” a source told Page Six. “She said she loves him and asked if he wanted ‘cookies from Paris.'”  Holmes and Foxx reportedly began dating in 2013 after Holmes divorced Cruise in 2012, but Holmes and Foxx went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret. That’s because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  They still have never publicly confirmed that they are a couple, though they did the next best thing in September 2017 by being photographed together, walking on a beach in Malibu holding hands.  Then again, when RadarOnline reported in late June that the couple had split, Holmes representative went on the record to call the story “100 percent untrue.” Many outlets took the on-the-record denial as an official confirmation that there is — or was — a relationship.  Us magazine said there are other challenges to the relationship, notably the fact that Holmes lives in New York City and Foxx is based in Los Angeles. But they see each other “more than people would think,” a source said.  The key to Foxx’s hold on Holmes is that he’s “mesmerizing,” “entertaining” and can always make her laugh, the source told Us. So, somehow it works for her — for now.  “She has fun with him when they are together,” the source said. “It’s a relationship that works for her.”	1
The exciting news comes as the actress’ former surrogate Michelle Ross – who gave birth to SJP and her husband Matthew Broderick’s twins Marion and Tabitha in 2009 – revealed she is once again preparing to be a surrogate.  ‘When you are having your first visit with a new Dr and he’s crazy excited that you were a surrogate three times... And even more excited when you mention doing it one more time in a year or so,’ posted Michelle on Facebook.  ‘And he complimented my uterus, so he’s a keeper. Only a surrogate knows the excited joy of hearing: “You have a perfect uterus.”’  If Michelle were to successfully deliver another child for SJP, it would make the 52-year-old actress one of the oldest celebrity women to welcome a new baby.	1
Tom Petty was found unconscious and not breathing in his Malibu home Sunday night after suffering a full cardiac arrest, TMZ reports. Law enforcement officials tell the outlet that the 66-year-old rock legend was rushed to UCLA Santa Monica Hospital where he was put on life support and his pulse returned. Later the decision was reportedly made to remove him from life support after it was found that he was lacking brain activity.  Los Angeles County Fire Department officials confirm to PEOPLE that they were dispatched to the Malibu home of an unconscious male around 10:45 p.m. on Sunday night and transported him to a local hospital. The Blast confirmed a 66-year-old man was transported from an address matching Petty’s.  Though his current condition is unknown, he was found in critical condition.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Fellow music star Sheryl Crow tweeted her well wishes to Petty, saying “I love you so much. You are in my prayers.”  .@TomPetty… I love you so much. You are in my prayers. — Sheryl Crow (@SherylCrow) October 2, 2017  Petty first burst onto the music scene in 1976 with his group, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The band scored a string of hits over several decades, including “American Girl,” “Free Falin’,” “Refugee” and “I Won’t Back Down.” He was also a member of the supergroup collective the Traveling Wilburys in the late ’80s alongside Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne.  Angela Weiss/Getty  Last Monday, Petty concluded his extensive recent tour—which kicked off on April—at the Hollywood Bowl. In December he admitted to Rolling Stone that the trek, done to honor the 40th anniversary of the Heartbreakers’ debut, would likely be “the last big one.”  “We’re all on the backside of our 60s,” he continued. “I have a granddaughter now I’d like to see as much as I can. I don’t want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that’s a lot of time.”	0

News that Abby Lee Miller has been scheduled for early release from California prison for good behavior isn't the only thing going well for the Dance Moms alum.  The criminal choreographer is said to have slimmed down quite a bit during her stay, shedding a whopping 100lbs according to Entertainment Tonight.  The Lifetime reality figure, 51, gave the public of glimpse of her new figure in a grateful Instagram post shared on social media Sunday.  Slimming down: Abby Lee Miller's facing a streak of positive breaks as she's said to have lost 100lbs during her time in prison. This news comes after it was reported the Dance Moms coach has been granted early release  Abby, who began her sentence at Federal Correctional Complex in Victorville, California July, 12 2017, opened up about her experience behind bars in a lengthy caption accompanying a picture of her visit from several of her Dance Moms costars.  The dance instructor began on a reflective note: 'Sometimes in life you make mistakes I trusted the wrong people and didn’t pay any attention to things I should of. I’m more than sorry for the mistakes I have made.  'My world flipped upside down when I had to enter prison. I did so with grace, the stories you read about me been a princess are untrue.'  She continued: 'I have made friends with both inmates and staff, I’ve tried to better myself, participated in anything offered to me and I am a better person for this experience.'  Transformation: The star has trimmed down during her time behind bars  She was cautious about word of an early release, writing: 'All the press stories and speculation are not entirely correct however, I am feeling hopeful but no dates have been confirmed at this time.'

Reunited and it feels so good! Kim Kardashian got nostalgic on Friday, April 13, when she attended her 20-year high school reunion with pals she hadn’t seen in two decades.  The KKW founder, 37, shared a series of clips on Snapchat documenting her appearance at her alma mater, Marymount High School, which she graduated from in 1998.  “So my friends are worried that we’re gonna run into people that they were mean to and I feel so good about my conscience that I was so nice to everyone,” Kardashian quipped as a friend says in the background, “So nice.”  Back at her old stomping grounds, the reality star reminisced while showing off shots of the private high school, saying, “We are walking down the same halls that we walked 20 years ago, this is crazy!” She also shared several selfies with friends.  A lot has happened to the former Catholic schoolgirl since she graduated in ’98. The mom of three — who shares North, 4, Saint, 2, and 3-month-old Chicago with husband Kanye West — is now known as an icon worldwide with an empire that includes her family’s hit E! series and a makeup line.

There is a snowman’s chance in hell that Disney will give Elsa a girlfriend in Frozen 2.  And yet, thanks to a vague new comment from Frozen 2 co-director Jennifer Lee, LGBT Disney fans are probably going to get their hopes up once again, only to watch them melt.  “I love everything that people are saying [and] people are thinking about with our film—that it’s creating dialogue, that Elsa is this wonderful character that speaks to so many people,” Lee told HuffPost in a recent interview, when asked about the prospect of Elsa getting a girlfriend. “It means the world to us that we’re part of these conversations.”  Lee followed up that response with a lengthy comment that barely amounts to a “maybe” when read carefully: “Where we’re going with it, we have tons of conversations about it, and we’re really conscientious about these things. For me…Elsa’s every day telling me where she needs to go, and she’ll continue to tell us. I always write from character-out, and where Elsa is and what Elsa’s doing in her life, she’s telling me every day. We’ll see where we go.”  HuffPost correctly labeled that noncommittal response a “glimmer of hope” for the #GiveElsaAGirlfriend campaign, which sprouted up on social media in 2016. Others have been more generous in their assessment: “Ring The Alarm!” BuzzFeed declared. “Elsa Might Have A Girlfriend In The ‘Frozen’ Sequel.” But it’s safe to say that we can un-ring that bell. If you think there’s a serious chance Elsa will find same-sex love in Arendelle, it’s probably best to let that hope go. Disney has been down this road before.  “ For the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. ”  Remember when eagle-eyed fans spotted a lesbian-looking couple in the Finding Dory trailer, creating mounting speculation that we’d see definitively LGBT representation in a Pixar movie, only for the film’s co-director to give the cop-out answer, “They can be whatever you want them to be?”  Or when the director of the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake promised an “exclusively gay moment,” angering social conservatives, only for Gaston’s sidekick LeFou to be briefly spotted dancing with another man in the film’s finale? (As my Daily Beast colleague Kevin Fallon wrote, “Truth be told, the most exclusively gay moment in this new Beauty and the Beast is my dramatic eye roll after seeing the actual thing.”)  Disney’s biggest PG-13 property has disappointed LGBT fans as well.  In 2016, director J.J. Abrams told The Daily Beast that he “would love it” if there were a gay character in Star Wars and that “it seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say that there wouldn’t be a homosexual character in that world.” Yet there are still no confirmed gay people to be found in the new films—despite some fans’ rigorous shipping of Finn and Poe. (And now that yet another Star Wars trilogy has been announced, there will be three more opportunities to depict a galaxy far, far away where, apparently, gay people either do not exist or live in hiding.)  For the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. There’s no reason to expect them to stop toeing that line until it’s safe for the film giant to throw their full weight behind the LGBT community.  As the LGBT media advocacy group GLAAD noted in 2017, Walt Disney Studios “has the weakest historical record when it comes to LGBTQ-inclusive films” out of all the big studios. Disney’s got a family-friendly reputation to protect, and at a time when many Americans still think that children need to be protected from LGBT “corruption”—37 percent of respondents to one recent GLAAD survey, for example, said they would be uncomfortable with their child learning about LGBT history in school—a lesbian or bisexual Snow Queen is probably perceived as an unnecessary financial risk.  According to Fast Company writer Joe Berkowitz, the “most family-friendly studio on the planet would be inviting a boycott” if they gave Elsa a girlfriend—so why sell fewer tickets to a guaranteed smash hit when you can sell more?  And when Disney already caused an uproar among anti-LGBT evangelicals five years ago with Elsa’s nonspecific, feel-good song lyrics about “let[ting] it go” and “break[ing] through,” why would they double down this time around when they are sure to be under scrutiny?  The parallel isn’t perfect, of course, but I always think about the interracial couple in The Princess and the Frog whenever LGBT fans seem to think the moment for a queer Disney character has finally arrived. According to Gallup polling data, a majority of Americans have approved of marriage between black people and white people since 1997, and over 75 percent have approved since 2004, but Disney still waited until 2009, when support was over 80 percent, to tell the story of Tiana and her prince. That’s the definition of playing it safe.  So, if we speculate that Disney would wait to include an LGBT main character in an animated film until they only risked angering fewer than 20 percent of American viewers, then we’ve still got a ways to go yet. As of 2017, according to Gallup, only 64 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 42 percent in 2004. If approval continues to climb at that exact same rate, it will hit the 80 percent mark in…17 years—probably about the same time that Frozen 7: Olaf’s Revenge comes out.  It would be nice if Disney, like Elsa, could proclaim, “Let the storm rage on” and march forward. But if history is any indication, Frozen 2 will almost certainly give hopeful LGBT fans the cold shoulder.	0
Harvey Weinstein is prepared to let the law take its course, a source tells PEOPLE.  “Harvey will abide by standard legal protocol and in the meantime, he is staying true to his self-improvement recovery journey and relying on friends and family and his inner strength,” says the source.  “He still has his sense of humor and is more concerned about everyone else before himself, especially his family,” the source maintains.  Investigators in Manhattan are preparing to place the mogul under arrest tomorrow following a lengthy investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted multiple women, a source confirmed on Thursday.  Weinstein, 66, is reportedly facing charges in connection with Lucia Evans, who told investigators that the producer forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004, and possibly additional charges relating to other accusers, according to the New York Daily News.  Sources also told the outlet that a grand jury was convened weeks ago to hear the evidence against Weinstein.  Harvey Weinstein. John Carucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock  The producer’s attorney Benjamin Brafman did not immediately respond to a request for comment at the time.  After news of Weinstein’s possible arrest broke, the New Yorker published an interview with Evans who confirmed she was pressing charges against the Weinstein.  “At a certain point, you have to think about the greater good of humanity, of womankind,” she told Ronan Farrow about her decision to cooperate with police.  “They said that if I do nothing, Harvey would walk,” Evans added. “I think the significance hit all at once.”  Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 60 women since The New York Times and The New Yorker documented decades of alleged sexual misconduct and sexual assault involving a number of women in detailed, Pulitzer-prize winning articles in October.  RELATED VIDEO: Will Harvey Weinstein Scandal Change Things for Women and Sexual Harassment in Hollywood?  A spokesperson for the Oscar winner previously told PEOPLE in a statement that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”  The sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein have also gotten the attention of the federal government.  The U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York has begun a criminal probe investigating in part whether he enticed or persuaded any women to cross state lines with the intent of committing a sex crime, which is potentially a federal offense, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the news.  Brafman confirmed to PEOPLE that he has met with federal prosecutors in the SDNY “in an attempt to dissuade them from proceeding” and will continue to meet with them moving forward.  “Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in nonconsensual sexual acts,” Brafman added.	1

"Keeping Up with the Kardashians (often abbreviated KUWTK) is an American reality television series that airs on the E! cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007 and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The fifteenth season premiered on August 5, 2018.[2]  The series focuses mainly on sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian and their half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. It also features their parents Kris and Caitlyn Jenner (previously known as Bruce Jenner), and brother Rob Kardashian. The significant others of the Kardashian sisters have also appeared on the show, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries and Khloé's ex-husband Lamar Odom and ex-boyfriend French Montana. Caitlyn's son Brody Jenner made cameo appearances in the early seasons, before appearing regularly between the 8th and 11th seasons, along with brother Brandon and Brandon's wife Leah. Kim's friend Jonathan Cheban and Khloé's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.  Keeping Up with the Kardashians has received very poor critical reviews since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the ""famous for being famous"" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence.[3] However, some critics recognized the reality series as a ""guilty pleasure"" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, Keeping Up with the Kardashians has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several audience awards.  The series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous spin-off series, including: Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Khloé & Lamar, Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, Dash Dolls, Rob & Chyna, and Life of Kylie. The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.  Background [ edit ]  Robert Kardashian (1944–2003) and Kristen Mary ""Kris"" Houghton (born 1955) married in 1978, and had four children together: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), and Khloé (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991. In 1994, Robert rose to prominence when he defended O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman during the O.J. Simpson trial.[4][5] In 1991, Kris married retired Olympic decathlon champion Caitlyn Jenner (born 1949; formerly known as Bruce Jenner before undergoing a gender transition in 2015).[6] Kris and Caitlyn had two daughters together, Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997). Robert died in 2003, eight weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer.[7] The Kardashian sisters began appearing in the media spotlight more often. In 2004, Kim became a personal stylist for recording artist Brandy Norwood. She eventually developed into a full-time stylist, and was a personal shopper and stylist for actress Lindsay Lohan.[8] Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney ventured further into fashion, opening a high fashion boutique Dash in Calabasas, California. Throughout Kim's early career, she was involved in some high-profile relationships including Brandy Norwood's brother, singer Ray J, and later, singer Nick Lachey.[8] In 2006, Kourtney starred in her first reality television series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive.[9] In February 2007, a home sex video that Kim made with Ray J years earlier was leaked.[10] Vivid Entertainment bought the rights for $1 million and released the film as Kim Kardashian: Superstar on February 21.[10] Kim sued Vivid for ownership of the tape, but dropped the suit in April 2007 settling with Vivid Entertainment for $5 million.[11] It is often assumed that the release of the sex tape was a major contributor to the rising fame of Kim Kardashian and her family.[12]  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  The Osbournes was popular. I had seen The Osbournes and thought to myself — because I had formed a production company — I thought we should find something in this vein. And at the time, we had heard that Kris was interested in doing something with the family, so it was me and one other guy at the company. […] We had no idea it would become the monster pop culture business that it is."" ""[Kris] was interested in doing a television show and this was in the time thatwas popular. I had seenand thought to myself — because I had formed a production company — I thought we should find something in this vein. And at the time, we had heard that Kris was interested in doing something with the family, so it was me and one other guy at the company. […] We had no idea it would become the monster pop culture business that it is."" —Ryan Seacrest on developing the idea for the reality series.[13]  The idea of creating a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family.[14] Jenner commented: ""Everybody thinks that [my children] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural.""[15] Producer Ryan Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in mind. He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: ""They were all together — as crazy and as fun as loving as they are,"" Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with E!, an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and reality television series; the show was eventually picked up.[13][16] In August 2007, it was announced that the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a ""new non-scripted family sitcom"", being produced by Ryan Seacrest and Bunim/Murray Productions. The series' announcement came one week after Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie announced that their popular E! series, The Simple Life, was ending.[17]  The show, entitled Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007.[18] The reality series centers around the members of the Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family ""show[s] off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family,"" as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz.[19] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: ""Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections"".[20] Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, ""When we first started [the show], we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'"".[21] She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network ""has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted"".[21] The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings.[18] Seacrest described the show's success: ""At the heart of the series—despite the catfights and endless sarcasm—is a family that truly loves and supports one another […] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain.""[9]  The following year, Keeping Up with the Kardashians was picked up for a third season.[22] In April 2012, E! signed a three-year deal with the Kardashian family that kept the series airing through seasons seven, eight and nine.[23] Keeping up with the Kardashians was later renewed for a tenth season which premiered on March 15, 2015.[24] In February 2015, it was announced that the show had been renewed for four more years, along with an additional spin-off series, making it one of the longest-running reality television series in the country.[25][26] In terms of the show's future, Kim Kardashian has commented that the reality series could go for an indefinite number of seasons saying that she: ""hope[s] it goes on for as long as it can.""[27] Keeping Up With the Kardashians, including its spin-off series, has become the cable network's flagship show and its most lucrative franchise. ""It has changed the face of E!"" said Lisa Berger, the network's executive producer. ""We were a place to report on celebrity; we weren't a place to break and make celebrity, which is now the whole idea of the E! brand.""[28] The show's success contributed significantly towards building the ""Kardashian brand"", or ""Kardashian Inc."" as it is called by The Hollywood Reporter. ""These shows are a 30-minute commercial,"" Khloé Kardashian admitted in 2011, in response to a suggestion that the television series is used to promote their retail stores and endorsement deals.[28]  On August 3, 2017, it was announced the show's 10 year anniversary will premiere on September 24, 2017 following the show's season 14 premiere.[29]  On August 24, 2017, it was announced the family had signed a $150 million deal with E!.[30]  Cast [ edit ]  The reality series revolves around the children of Kris Jenner, and originally focused mainly on the children from her first marriage to deceased attorney Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob. Kris' children Kendall and Kylie from her subsequent marriage to American athlete Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner have also been featured on the show since its beginning,[31][32] along with Jenner's son Brody from another marriage, although he appeared very few times during the early seasons, mostly being called by his step-brother Rob to babysit their half-sisters Kylie and Kendall.[33] Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, as well as on the show's spin-offs.[31] Cast members also include numerous friends and other acquaintances of the family members, most notably Malika Haqq and Jonathan Cheban who joined Keeping Up with the Kardashians in the second and third seasons, respectively.[34][35]  Most of the Kardashian sisters' significant others have appeared on the reality series. Kim's relationship with football player Reggie Bush was featured on the show when they were dating; after the breakup, Bush commented on appearing on the show saying that he never felt comfortable being followed by cameras, adding: ""I do it because it's important to [Kim].""[36] Rob's relationship with singer Adrienne Bailon has also been documented on the show when they were dating from 2007 to 2009; although Bailon later admitted that the decision to appear on the show, and be associated with the family, hurt her career.[37] Kim's eventual husband Kris Humphries first appeared on the show during the premiere of the sixth season; their relationship was chronicled throughout the season and ended with the couple's wedding special ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event"".[38] They eventually went through a highly publicized divorce; Kardashian's former publicist later claimed that Humphries was allegedly set up to be portrayed on the show in a negative way and that the short-lived marriage was staged for the cameras as a ploy to generate money.[39][40]  Khloé married basketball player Lamar Odom during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009. He later had a major role as part of the supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé.[41] Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim.[42] However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: ""You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get.""[43] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed.[44] In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.[33]  The success of the reality series resulted in the development of several spin-off shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled Kourtney and Khloé in Miami, which was later renamed Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. ""It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. […] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' and we think that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami,"" Harbert added.[45] The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since The Anna Nicole Show in 2002.[46] The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010,[47] and later returned as Kourtney and Kim Take Miami for a third season on January 20, 2013.[48] Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how to live like a ""king"".[49]  ""Khloé and Lamar are such a dynamic couple that we just knew we had to give them their own series. […] They are funny, dramatic, opinionated, and we intend to capture all this, along with the unvarnished reality of their lives together and apart, since each is constantly followed by their own celebrity spotlight."" —Lisa Berger, the executive vice president of the network.[50]  In October 2010, the network announced another spin-off called Kourtney and Kim Take New York which followed the same format as its predecessor. The show debuted on January 23, 2011, and followed the sisters who opened a Dash location in New York City.[51] The series returned for another season which premiered on November 27 the same year.[52] In January 2011, Khloé & Lamar, which featured Khloé and her husband Lamar Odom, became the third spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[53] The show premiered on April 10, 2011, and lasted two seasons.[54] In March 2014, E! announced the fourth spin-off entitled Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons.[55] The series premiered on November 2, 2014, and followed Kourtney and Khloé who relocated to the Hamptons to work on opening a new Dash pop-up store.[56] The fifth spin-off series called Dash Dolls premiered on September 20, 2015. The reality series chronicles the daily life of the employees of the Dash boutique in Los Angeles.[57] In June 2016, the network announced another show entitled Rob & Chyna which premiered on September 11 the same year, and follows the relationship of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna as they prepare to welcome their first child.[58] The show was later renewed for a second season.[59] In July 2017, E! confirmed the series was put on hold, and not on their current schedule.[60]  The network has also aired several television specials featuring important family events. A two-part television event called ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event"", showcasing the wedding between Kim and Kris Humphries, was broadcast on October 9 and 10, 2011 as part of the sixth season; the special was highly successful with a combined 10.5 million viewers.[61] A few days after Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) came out as a trans woman during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in May 2015, E! aired a two-part special on Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled ""About Bruce"", in which another side of the story was told featuring family members who were not involved in the previous interview on 20/20.[62] The first part of the special debuted on May 17, 2015, and attracted 2.92 million total viewers, a 40% increase from the previous episode, while the second part aired the following day with similar viewership.[63] I Am Cait, a separate documentary series, was announced immediately after the 20/20 interview. Jeff Olde, head of programming at E! network, said that the series is ""not at all a Kardashian spin-off"", and that ""we will not resort to spectacle,"" trying to emphasize its distinct format that is entirely different from most programming on the network, including Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[64] The eight-part, one-hour docuseries debuted on July 26, 2015, on E!, and focused on how Jenner was handling the aftermath of the transition; it also attempted to deal with various LGBT-related issues.[65][66] It was later cancelled after two seasons.[67] In April 2017, it was announced E! had ordered an 8-episode spin-off Life of Kylie revolving around Kylie Jenner. It premiered on August 6, 2017.[68]  Reception [ edit ]  Critical response [ edit ]  ""The Kardashians are the last ladies standing in reality TV because they've simply always believed they were celebrities – endlessly amused with themselves, endlessly oblivious to one another. Their vanity is impervious to the outside world, which is how many of us often wish our own personal vanity worked. Their gargantuan egos, their petty jealousies, their catty feuds, the effort-vs.-eye-roll they put into reciting their lines, their commitment to frivolity at all costs – these are seductive qualities in a reality-TV star, however repugnant they might be in real life. Whatever it is you watch reality TV for, the Kardashians just have a lot more of it."" —Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone[69]  Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been the subject of constant panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for Variety, said that the network: ""widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood — including Kim's sisters Khloé and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, who now has the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows.""[70] Ginia Bellafonte of The New York Times compared the show to reality series Gene Simmons Family Jewels and exclaimed that: ""the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier.""[71] Laura Burrows of IGN criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves. Following the conclusion of the second season of the series, Burrows wrote: ""Those of us who watch this show […] want to believe that these whores of attention have souls and would actually do something for their fellow man and not reap the benefits of their service, but two seasons' worth of self-absorbed egocentrism speaks to the contrary.""[72]  Roxana Hadadi, reviewing Keeping Up with the Kardashians for The Washington Post, was extremely negative towards the reality series due to its absurdity, and commented that the show: ""firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut — from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable.""[73] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: ""Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame. But even worse—it is downright boring to watch this family live out their tedious lives.""[74] John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed the reason for the family's success by saying that: ""the Kardashians' fame is a lot like Möbius strip or an M. C. Escher painting.""[75] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: ""Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections"".[20] Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: ""illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay."" Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: ""America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for all the world to see.""[76]  Goal Auzeen Saedi, reviewing Keeping Up with the Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: ""The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become."" Saedi also questioned their decision to appear on the show and added: ""But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the way your life is being lived and criticized, perhaps you can take the cameras out of your house.""[77] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: ""roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, but for the most part this show is the 100% drizzling poops.""[78] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that ""even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not,"" adding that the ""entertainment value [of the show] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change.""[79] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that ""in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them,"" after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the ""About Bruce"" special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations ""seemed a little too staged, too controlled"", and noted that ""there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues.""[80]  Keeping Up with the Kardashians has me imagining the raven-haired siblings being tracked by a slobbering pack of hunting dogs. Sadly, the reality is much more mundane. The best we can hope for is a peek into the crazy chaos of life on the ""The title of the show is misleading –has me imagining the raven-haired siblings being tracked by a slobbering pack of hunting dogs. Sadly, the reality is much more mundane. The best we can hope for is a peek into the crazy chaos of life on the A-list . […] The Kardashians would be the first to admit that their notoriety has little to do with any discernible talent, beyond an alarming capability for self-promotion."" —Gareth Dimelow from Sabotage Times[81]  However, several critics were more positive towards the show. A number of publications welcomed the show as ""guilty pleasure"", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week.[82][83][84] Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: ""my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake.""[85] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated the success of the family which ""achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing,"" using the given platform.[86] Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last"".[87] Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. ""Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after,"" Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. ""But more likely, she and E! are laughing all the way to the bank – 10.5 million viewers tuned into ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event"", after all,"" Kelly summarized the controversy.[88] Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that ""it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable"".[89]  Viewership [ edit ]  ""At their core, the Kardashians are an incredibly bonded, loving, large family who live an incredibly large life. And if you actually look at the history of television, there's a pretty large number of families with that blend resonating with viewers. This just happens to be the first reality show that does it. […] It's just an incredibly fascinating drama that's played out. But at its core, you know that they're going to end up around that dinner table together."" —E! President Suzanne Kolb discusses the popularity of the series in an interview with The Wrap.[90]  Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been a ratings success for E! – in its first month it became the highest-rated series aired on Sunday nights for adults 18–34 and was seen by 1.3 million total viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.[18][91] Lisa Berger, executive vice president of original programming and series development for E!, said: ""The buzz surrounding the series is huge, and viewers have clearly fallen for the Kardashians. […] Seacrest and Bunim-Murray's unique ability to capture this family's one-of-a-kind dynamics and hilarious antics has made the series a fantastic addition to our prime-time lineup.""[18] The second season continued the success and was viewed by 1.6 million viewers on average, which led to a third season renewal.[92] The two-hour fourth-season premiere, which aired on November 8, 2009, and featured the wedding ceremony of Khloé and Lamar Odom, brought in then-record ratings with 3.2 million viewers.[93] The subsequent season debuted with nearly 4.7 million total viewers, which ranked as the highest-rated season premiere of the show, as of August 2015.[94] It was also the second highest-rated episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, second only to the previous season's record-breaking finale with 4.8 million viewers.[95]  The seventh-season premiere of the series, which aired on May 20, 2012 in its earlier timeslot, continued to deliver high ratings attracting almost three million total viewers which exceeded the premiere of the previous season by 16%.[96] Kim Kardashian has explained the success of the show by saying that people tune in to watch the series because they can relate themselves to the members of the family; in an interview with the V magazine she said: ""You can see that soap operas aren't on the air as much anymore. I think reality shows are taking over that genre, but I think the draw to our show is that we are relatable.""[97] The eighth season debuted to 3 million viewers, up 6% from the previous season, while the subsequent ninth season's premiere was down by 20%.[98][99] The ninth season averaged 3.3 million total viewers and almost 2.2 million in the 18–49 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers. It was the highest rated cable show in its timeslot.[24] The series finished as the most-social ad-supported cable program and, as of March 2015, Keeping Up with the Kardashians is the most-watched show on E! network.[100] The first episode of the tenth season averaged 2.5 million viewers, slightly less than the premiere of the ninth season.[101] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Keeping Up with the Kardashians ""tends to most popular in areas with large Hispanic populations, particularly in the Southwest"".[102]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  Despite negative reviews from critics, Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been nominated for, and won, several television awards.

"“ A recent study found that marriage actually has health benefits. Married people live longer, have fewer strokes, and fewer heart attacks than people who are single. Scientific or not, I find that study incredibly irritating. Happily, there are other studies that tell us the real truth about the health benefits of marriage, which is that the benefits have nothing to do with marriage at all. Because those studies have shown that staying in an unhappy marriage is the worst thing you can do for your health and your children. So better health is a direct result of healthy relationships. You don't need a spouse, you just need someone you can trust. You need someone you can talk to. You need someone who will celebrate your wins and grieve your losses. You need someone who can forgive you. You need someone who will show up, no questions asked, and walk with you through every unexpected twist and turn life throws your way. ” — Meredith Grey  All of Me is the twenty-fourth episode and season finale of the fourteenth season and the 317th overall episode of Grey's Anatomy.  Contents show]  Short Summary Edit  The doctors attend Alex and Jo's wedding, and things do not go as planned.

Full Summary Edit  April and wedding planner Kirsten are orchestrating things for Alex and Jo's outdoor wedding.  Meredith is doing Zola's hair. Zola is going to be the flower girl. Zola asks Meredith if she is going to get married again. Meredith doesn't think so because she had her great love. Zola doesn't think love is like candy. You can't be too greedy for it or fill up on it.  Down in the kitchen, Arizona has steamed Alex's suit. She is going home to pick up Sofia and her dress, and then she'll pick up Jo and drive her to the island. Meredith is going to take Alex. They can't be late or April will destroy them.

Meredith comes down the stairs and tells them they can't see each other before the wedding. She's not surprised to hear about the minimally invase surgery fellowship. While they don't believe that them seeing each other will bring bad luck, they agree not to tell April. Arizona leaves with Jo. Meredith says Boston is like a tundra for 6 months out of the year. Alex doesn't mind. The babysitter's arriving any minute, so Alex needs to get ready to leave.  Owen is feeding Leo when Amelia and Betty return from a meeting. Betty is 30 days sober. Amelia laid out dresses for the wedding. Owen gives Betty a fist bump, after which Betty leaves to try on dresses. Owen asks Amelia if Betty's parents showed. They didn't. Betty doesn't know Amelia invited them. She'll try again when Betty hits 60 days. Amelia leaves to get dressed.  Bailey reminds Ben they need to leave as she goes through the mail. She finds a check for the TrailBlazer. It's an insane amount of money.  Kirsten is yelling at the caterer on the phone, as they are not at the right location. April thanks Matthew for being here, despite their history at weddings. Jo, Arizona, and Sofia arrive. Jo loves the location. April directs Jo to the bridal suite where hair and makeup people are waiting for her. Jo says Alex is on the way. April is sure the guests will start to arrive any minute.  Meanwhile, the other surgeons sit down in a church. Jackson and Maggie discuss April quitting her job to do God's work. He's not sure what that means. Maggie is grateful that April is okay, but religion is not her thing. He can relate. They kiss. Dahlia is shocked to see that. The music starts playing. A flower girl and bridesmaids enter. Bailey didn't know Jo and Alex had so many friends outside the hospital. Jackson then gets a text from April asking where they are. He replies they are at the wedding, but she answers they aren't. The bride enters and they all realize they are at the wrong wedding.  At the real wedding, April is checking the invite and realizes she made a mistake on the GPS link. Meredith, Alex, and Zola arrive. Alex is ready to let Jo make her own decisions. Meredith tells Alex he is the sun, but she nuances that Jo is also sunny. Alex wants to take an appetizer, but Kirsten says they are for the guests, who are on their way.  At the church wedding, the bride's mother walks the bride down the aisle. The surgeons decide to subtly leave one by one. All goes well until Levi trips. Ben and Bailey start leaving as the ceremony begins, but suddenly the bride's mother collapses. Bailey says she's a doctor. Ben runs out to get a rig from the firefighter crew around the corner.  Meredith starts drinking at the wedding while Owen, Amelia, Betty, and Leo arrive. Amelia thought they were late. Meredith explains what happened. Amelia says Owen is like a walking GPS, so he never uses one. Amelia notices something's up with Meredith. Amelia thinks she's in love with Alex as she suspected for years, but Meredith denies that. Meredith thinks Amelia is the one harboring feelings, for her ex with whom she's playing house. Meredith walks off as Owen comes over.  Jo's makeup is almost finished. Meredith comes in and says she's prepared to offer Jo an attending general surgeon position at Grey Sloan. She tells Jo to think about it and leaves.  As Alex is working on his tie, Arizona asks if he's nervous. She tells him not to be since it's all good. Arizona admits to being nervous. Arizona wants today to be perfect, because if today is perfect, you can always look back on that one perfect day if things start to go wrong in the future. Jo comes in. She needs to talk to Alex. Arizona leaves to keep April out. Alex compliments Jo's looks. Jo tells him about Meredith's offer. She thinks Alex put Meredith up to it to keep her here despite his promise to follow her everywhere. Alex swears he didn't do that. He's not Paul. Jo is not sure if she's ready to be an attending. Alex says no one ever feels ready. She doesn't want to be an attending since she can't get the interns to listen to her. Alex tells her to take the fellowship, then. They exchange ""I love you""s and kiss. Since everybody's late, they decide to find a place where April can't bust them. Jo ditches her heels for boots.  They secretly run around the domain and eventually find a hidden shed. Alex kicks the door in as it won't just open. Jo finds that hot.  Ben and Bailey arrive at the hospital with the bride's mother. Bailey gives instructions to Vik so she can go put on her scrubs. The family arrives in the limo. Lila and Jacob are concerned for Lila's mother, but Ben stops them and asks them to stay put.  Bailey suspects Lila's mom has an abdominal aortic aneurysm. She has Vik page whomever's on call since Pierce is at the wedding. Bailey refuses to let the woman die on her daughter's wedding day.  Alex and Jo are having sex in the shed. They can't see a thing.  The band starts playing as the guests finally arrive. Catherine compliments April on her work. April tells everyone they can sit wherever they want. Andrew wonders where to sit given his history with Jo and Alex. Catherine tells April they miss her at the hospital. April says the homeless communities really need her since they have little access to healthcare. It feels good to do what she does now. Catherine invites her to dinner on Sunday. April accepts. Kirsten comes up and asks April if Jo is ready to get married. April leaves to go check on her.  Arizona is handing out programs. Jackson and Matthew have an awkward meeting. They all scatter.  Vik says all the cardiothoracic surgeons on call are busy. As a gift from God, Teddy appears, happy to finally see someone she knows. Bailey asks her to scrub in. Teddy says she just got off a 12-hour flight, but Bailey doesn't care. Vik will handle her bags.  Jo and Alex want to leave the shed, but they find that the door is stuck. They can't open it from the inside. They start screaming.  Jackson tells Maggie it's awkward to be at a wedding with Matthew and April after what happened. Maggie says April and Matthew are together now, so they all need to get along for Harriet. Jackson has to make friends with Matthew.  April catches up with Arizona and tells her that Alex is not in the groom room. Arizona thinks she scared him away by talking about her own divorce. Arizona wonders what to tell Jo, but April informs her they are both gone. Arizona is relieved that it's not all on her. They go off to find the couple.  Richard found out that Meredith offered Jo an attending position. Richard knows she did it in order not to lose Alex. It's not fair to Jo, because that fellowship is one of the most exciting in the country and what she does the next year will define her entire career. Meredith reminds him she did well without a fellowship, but Richard points out that Jo doesn't share her pedigree. Jo deserves more training. After Richard walks off, Amelia sneaks up on Meredith and asks if it's Jo whom Meredith is in love with. She can understand it after all the hours they spent together doing the study. Meredith tells Amelia to stop projecting. Meredith says it's clear she's falling in love with Owen again. Alex is her Alex. She just got happy in a world without Cristina and Derek and she doesn't want to be alone. Amelia says she'll always be there for Meredith even if she is falling for Owen.  Jo thinks this is all her fault for seeing Alex before the wedding. Alex says this will just be a funny story they'll their kids. Alex finds a window covered in mud. He smashes the glass. With more light streaming, Jo sees a skeleton and screams. Alex admits he probably shouldn't have seen her dress.  Meredith tells Jackson she found Jo's heels in the groom room, so she figures Jo and Alex snuck off to have sex. Kirsten reminds the waiters to circulate with the hors d'oeuvres. Jackson comments she's relentless.  The interns are doing shots. Taryn proposes a toast to Meredith's beauty. Andrew passes by and Dahlia invites him to join them. He downs a shot and orders another one.  Matthew is disappointed by an appetizer. Jackson admits it takes a big person to come here after everything that happened. He doesn't know what to say or do, but April deserves to be happy. They both do. Matthew says he's trying to build a life with April and Jackson is Harriet's father, so he has to be a Christian about this. It's really hard not to hit Jackson. Jackson says he lost a quarter of a billion dollars. That helps.  Amelia and Betty enter the groom room, where Owen is feeding Leo. Amelia tells Owen that everyone is looking for Alex, so he should tell Alex to stay put in case he comes back. Amelia leaves but Betty stays with Owen and asks him if he and Amelia are getting married. She's been living with them for a month and she still can't figure out if they are a couple or not. Owen says they're not. Betty says they are in a weird situation then. She wonders why they are not married. Owen brings up the tumor. It was hard and it's complicated. Betty thinks it's just weird now, not complicated.  In the waiting area, Ben serves coffee to the family members.  Teddy and Bailey are operating on Lila's mom. If she was experiencing pain, she smiled through it. Bailey thinks of her as a sign. Bailey says she and Ben arrived at the wrong wedding. If Bailey hadn't been there, this woman would be dead. This happened mere months after Bailey almost dropped dead herself. She tries to live a healthy life now and prays to God to let her live to see her son getting married. However, she just returned to her life as if nothing happened. Teddy says she can help if she wants to move to another country. Bailey apologizes for her not making it to the wedding after travelling all this way, but Teddy says she wasn't invited. Vik says he wasn't either. Bailey asks why she's here. Teddy says she was going to ask her for a job. Bailey doesn't respond.  Alex is still shouting to no avail. He's frustrated because the band's music doesn't stop. Jo finds a wallet on the skeleton. His name was Aldin. He was an organ donor. He had grandkids and a dog. He lived a full life. Maybe he's here to show them what they should aspire to be. Alex says he died in a shed and nobody found him, which doesn't exactly look like luck. Jo laughs. Alex loves that she always finds a silver lining. They continue to laugh together.  A drunk Taryn wants to go tell Meredith how she feels, but Carina stops her. Love is precious and it shouldn't be wasted on someone who can't love you back. She glances at Arizona.  April sits down with Arizona, who's texting, and says the minister still hasn't arrived and the engaged couple is nowhere to be found. She thinks this is yet another wedding catastrophe orchestrated by her. Arizona says it's not a catastrophe. What is a catastrophe is the fact that she keeps smiling due to texts from Callie. Richard overheard her and asks why that is a catastrophe. Arizona says because Callie left her twice and took their daughter. Just because they are both single now doesn't mean that they should get back together. Nobody ever hurt her like Callie has. April hears that, but nobody ever hurt Matthew like she did. Richard also hurt Catherine. People change and life changes you. Your only job is to stay open to possibilities. It's not a catastrophe that Callie is making her smile again. Richard agrees. Arizona is going to miss them tremendously. She and April both get emotional and hug.  Kristen grabs a mic. She says the officiant should be here soon. In the meantime, they can enjoy a toast. She randomly picks DeLuca. She hands him the mic. The other guests immediately realize that was a bad choice since he's drunk. Andrew says he's a co-worker of Alex and Jo's, or more. Blood has been spilled, which makes them family. He's happy for them, because when two people find a moment of real and true love that hasn't been ripped from your claws, you have to celebrate that. Meredith thinks him for the speech and takes the mic away. She takes Andrew for a walk. Meanwhile, Kristen asks if anybody has an EpiPen because she apparently ate some shrimp, to which she's highly allergic. The doctors rush to her side as her throat closes up. April thinks this is a catastrophe.  Richard goes to call 911 as Kirsten goes into anaphylactic shock. April found a first-aid kit, which contains Benadryl. Since Kirsten's throat is closed, they'll have to put it in her rectum. They turn her on her side. April makes everyone turn around and asks for scissors to cut through the spanx. Owen starts CPR. Richard comes back and says the ambulance is facing traffic. Jackson decides they need to crike Kirsten now. April asks a waitress for the sharpest knife she can find.  Bailey tells Lila and Jacob that they caught it in time. They inserted a graft in the weakened part of the aorta. Her mother's going to be okay. They enter the ICU room. She hates that she tanked Lila's wedding. She wants them to find a pastor to marry them today. Lila doesn't want to get married with her mother in the ICU. Lila's mom says her guests came all the way here for them. Teddy informs them that she'll have to stay in the ICU for at least a couple of days. Jacob wants to reschedule, but Lila's mom objects. They are alive and in love, and they people who love them came together to celebrate that. They can't take that for granted. Bailey might have a solution so they don't have to do it without Lila's mom.  Meredith and Andrew are walking. She knows how much it sucks to lose the person you love. Sam wouldn't want him to drown in his pain. He's young and he's handsome, so he'll fall in love again and get his heart broken again. That's life, a beautiful mess. He can't cling to what was, but he has to look at what can be. He then kisses her, which she stops right away. This wasn't a seduction. He thinks he's going to be fired, but she's flattered. They then hear Jo and Alex's screams. They find the shed. Andrew kicks the door in. They mention the dead guy and then rush off to get married.  Bailey tells Teddy she's a lifesaver. Teddy says she shouldn't have asked for a job since she knows Bailey already has a Head of Cardio. Bailey says she didn't put her on the spot. Teddy just gave her one more sign. Bailey wants to take a sabbatical from the Chief job and the stress it entails. She wants to do research and innovate and fall in love with the OR again and spend more time with the people she loves. She has more money now than she could ever need. Still, she has this voice in her head telling her she can't rest because she's a woman. She thinks it's the voice of patriarchy. So she's done listening to it and she's going to listen to her own. She offers Teddy the position of Interim Chief of Surgery. Teddy is interested. Ben comes in to say that they're ready. They are going to a wedding.  Jo, Alex, and Meredith find the doctors working on the wedding planner. Jackson makes the incision. April looks around for something straw-like and asks for a pinwheel from a bouquet. They insert it and resume CPR. Kirsten starts breathing again, causing the wheel to spin. Levi faints and drags the wedding cake down with him as he falls. Arizona thinks there's not going to be a wedding today. Alex agrees.  Almost everyone's back on the ferry to the main city. Meredith apologizes to Jo for today and the job offer. She wouldn't take it if she were Jo, so she won't be offended if Jo doesn't take it. Meredith loved working with Jo and Mass Gen would be lucky to have her.  Arizona is comforting April. Sofia is worried they are going to miss their flight. Arizona says they are just making sure that this mess will be cleaned up. Arizona and Sofia leave to get April some water. Matthew comes up. He wants to try again. He means the two of them. He kneels. Jackson comes back to inform Arizona that Kirsten is set up at the local hospital. She's going to be okay. He, Arizona, and Sofia watch from a distance. Matthew tells April he loves that she's the only one who cares that the wedding went to crap. He loves how she trusts God and how she sings to Harriet and how she holds her hands when they pray. He also loves how she talks to Ruby. April saved her and him. He knows it's fast and crazy, but he doesn't care. He loved who she was 5 years ago and he loves who she is today even more. He doesn't want to be without her ever again. He doesn't want to waste any more time. He asks her to marry him. She happily accepts. The minister then finally arrives. She thinks she missed the ceremony, but April and Matthew see an opportunity.  Maggie tells Alex that Jackson informed her Kirsten is going to be okay and that they are moving the party to Jackson's place. Catherine is ordering food as they speak. Alex thinks that's great. Maggie has an idea. She shows Alex something on her phone.  Alex finds Meredith and tells her that he'll never leave her even if he has to leave. He then shows her the website where she can instantly become an ordained minister. She clicks the button.  As Arizona is making a bouquet, Jackson and April talk. They agree this is crazy, but he is happy for her. He asks if she wants him to stay. Of course she does. They hug.  Meredith is officiating the wedding on the ferry. She says ferries made her sad, but from now on, she'll look at them the way Derek did. She'll see the beauty, the wind, the air, the sea, and the motion. She'll see the possibility because of Jo and Alex. She has never seen two people bring out better in each other. If they can take this day and turn it into lemonade, they can do anything. The spectators are all smiling. Owen has given his jacket to Amelia.  Arizona walks April down the aisle with Sofia as the flower girl. They hug before Arizona steps aside.  Meredith asks Alex if he wants to marry Jo Wilson. He does.  The minister asks Matthew if he takes April as his wife. He does.  Meredith asks Jo if she wants to marry Alex Karev. She super does.  The minister asks April if she takes Matthew as her husband. She does.  In the hospital chapel, Lila and Jacob exchange vows. Ben is holding up a tablet to allow Lila's mom to follow the ceremony from the ICU. Both Teddy and Lila's mom are emotional.  Meredith and the minister pronounce Alex and Jo and April and Matthew, respectively, husband and wife. Both couples kiss. As Arizona takes a photo, she receives a text from Callie that reads ""I can't wait to see you!"" Arizona smiles and continues to watch April and Matthew get married with Sofia and Jackson by her side.  The guests on the ferry applaud.  Jacob and Lila kiss. A crying Teddy comments that it's beautiful and touches her stomach. Lila's mom takes her hand and asks if she's expecting. Teddy says she is.  The people on the ferry continue to cheer for the newlyweds.

Meredith: I don't think so, Zozo. You know, I already had one great love in my life. I don't want to be too greedy. Zola: Mom, I don't think love is like candy. I don't think you could be too greedy for it, and I don't think you could fill up on it. Meredith: When did you turn 40?  Arizona: Don't. You're not gonna talk me out of moving, and it's just gonna make us sad, and that's not what today is about, so just shut up and eat your cereal. Alex: Today is about that. You're leaving today. Arizona: Not till after you get married. And Alex Karev married? That's, like, my work here is done. Alex: Well, at least can I say ""thank you""? Arizona: Not unless you want to make me cry.  Meredith: Just tell her to turn it down because you have a whole life here. Alex: I have to support her, which means letting her make her own decisions. Meredith: Well, she's not the sun. You are the sun. Alex: What? Meredith: Well, she's pretty sunny. Never mind.  Meredith: I feel less okay than I have in a long time. Amelia: Oh, my God. I knew it! Meredith: Knew what? Amelia: You're in love with Alex. It's okay. I am not judging. I have suspected it for years, but it's kind of a bad day for the revelation. Meredith: Amelia, stop talking. Amelia: Right, because people could hear, and that would be really bad. Meredith: No, because I'm not harboring any secret feelings. You may be harboring secret feelings for your ex, who you're playing house with, but I am not in love with Alex.  Arizona: I just want today to be perfect, you know, because if today is perfect, then somewhere down the road, you know, things get a little rough and someone leaves you or sues you for custody, you can always look back on that one perfect day, and it'll remind you why you got into the whole thing. Okay, I'm definitely gonna shut up.  Amelia: So, is it Jo you're secretly in love with? I mean, I get it. All those hours together of intense pioneering, it's totally understandable. It's just still kind of a bad day for... Meredith: I am not in love with anybody. Will you just stop projecting your secret love all over me? Amelia: I'm not projecting. Meredith: Please, you're clearly falling for Owen again. You're never even home. Maggie's always at Jackson's. Alex is my... He's my Alex. I just got happy in a world without Cristina and without Derek, and I don't want to be alone. Amelia: Okay, but even if I am kind of falling for Owen, I will always be here for you. Meredith: Oh, whatever.  Jackson: Look, man, it takes a big person to, you know, after everything that happened, just, um... I don't really know what to say in this situation or do, really, but I want April to be happy. She deserves that. You both do. Matthew: April, she's... I'm trying to build a life with her, and you are Harriet's father, so I guess what I'm trying to say is I want to be a Christian about this, but it's hard. Jackson: You want to hit me? Matthew: Yeah, I really, really do. Jackson: The Christian thing, right. Would it make you feel any better to know that I recently lost a quarter of a billion dollars? Matthew: Yes. Yes, it would, actually. Jackson: Anything I can do to help.  Taryn: I'm gonna tell Meredith Grey how I feel about her. Carina: No, no, no, Bambina. Love is precious. Don't waste it on someone who can't love you back.  April: So this is, like this is, like, a wedding catastrophe, right? Another wedding catastrophe orchestrated by me. Arizona: No, no, it's not a catastrophe. It's a beautiful day that's running late. You what is a catastrophe is that every time I get a text from Callie, I smile. Richard: Why is that a catastrophe? Arizona: Hi. Richard: I'm sorry. I was eavesdropping. Arizona: Because she left me. I mean, 'cause she left me, and then she left me again, but it was worse, because that time she took my daughter, and what? I mean, now because she's single and I'm single? No. No, no, no. No one has ever, in the history of my life, hurt me like Callie. April: I hear that, but, also, no one's ever hurt Matthew the way I hurt him when I left him at the altar. Richard: Well, I hurt Catherine pretty badly once or or twice. Nothing like leaving her at the altar. April: Right. People change, you know, and life life changes us, and our one job, really our only job, is to stay open to possibilities, right? I mean, it's not stupid. It's not a catastrophe that Callie's making you smile again. Richard: I agree. Actually, that's pretty beautiful. Arizona: I'm going to miss you two tremendously.  Andrew: I'm Andrew DeLuca. I'm a co-worker of Alex and Jo. Well, more than a co-worker, actually. Blood has been spilled between us, so that makes us family, I guess. Hey, we're having fun. But, seriously, you guys, I'm happy for them, you know, 'cause when two people find a moment just, like, a moment, you guys, of real and true love that hasn't been ripped from your claws, just screaming and bleeding, you got to celebrate that. Meredith: Thank you, DeLuca.  Meredith: Andrew, I know we don't know each other very well, but I do know how much it sucks to lose the person you love. And I know that Sam wouldn't want you spending your time drowning in your pain. Andrew, you're young, and you have that face. You're gonna fall in love again, and you're gonna get your heart broken again. And that's life. And it's beautiful, and it's messy. It's a beautiful mess, but you can't cling to what was. You have to look to what might be.  Bailey: I want to take a sabbatical. No, no. Not from from surgery. I mean, from paperwork and management and schedules and and stress. I want to take a sabbatical from stress. I want to research and innovate and fall in love with the OR again. And I want to spend time with the people that I love. I want to volunteer to create gardens in urban food deserts. And I want to watch TED Talks. I might even do a TED Talk. I have all this money now more money than I could ever need. I could do all of that, and I still have this voice in my head telling me that you know, because I'm a woman, that I can't. I can't pause. I can't rest. Ironically, I think it's the voice of the damn patriarchy. So I'm done listening to that voice. I'm listening to my own. Teddy: Good. Bailey: Dr. Altman, the position of Interim Chief just opened up. I love my job, so it's temporary, but what do you say? Teddy: I say let's keep talking.  Matthew: Let's try again. April: I don't think Alex or Jo would have any interest in having me attempt for a second time. Matthew: I wasn't talking about them. April, I love you. All day, I've watched you plan an entire wedding for other people, and I love that you're the only one who cares that it all went to crap. I love how much you trust God. I love how you sing to Harriet and how you hold her little hands when you pray with her. And I love the way you talk to Ruby. You saved her. You saved me. And I know that this is fast and crazy, but I don't care because I loved who you were five years ago, and I love you even more today. I don't ever want to be without you again, and I almost had to be. So I don't want to waste any more time. April, will you marry me? April: Yes.  Meredith: For the longest time, ferry boats made me sad. But from now on, I will look at them the way my husband did. I will see the beauty. I will see the wind, the air, the sea, the motion. I will see the possibility because of the two of you. I have never seen two people bring out better in each other. And if the two of you can take this day and turn it into lemonade, then you can do anything.  Arizona: Love you. April: Love you.  See Also Edit"	0
"Dierks Bentley and Cassidy Black first met in eighth grade at Ingleside Middle School in Phoenix, Ariz. The country crooner fell hard but admits he ""wasn't cool enough"" yet for his future wife.  ""I was way too immature and into drinking beer and guns and blowing things up,"" he tells People .  Black sums it up nicely: ""He was just trouble.""  They tried dating in high school but soon were separated by distance, with Bentley moving to Nashville at 19 years of age and Black working at an advertising firm in San Francisco, Calif.

Murphy is best known as a writer and cast member of the Comedy Central sketch-comedy series Chappelle's Show. He was the older brother of comedian Eddie Murphy and the older half-brother of Vernon Lynch Jr.  Early life [ edit ]  Murphy was born on July 12, 1959, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[3] His mother, Lillian, was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.  As an adolescent, Murphy spent 10 months in jail.[4] In 1978, on the day he was released from jail,[5] he enlisted in the United States Navy and served for six years as a Boiler Technician.[6] In 1983, shortly before being discharged from the Navy, Murphy witnessed a mushroom cloud over Beirut. He later learned that it was the aftermath of the Beirut barracks bombing in which 307 people were killed.[7]  Career [ edit ]  Murphy had minor roles in several films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and worked behind the scenes with the hip hop group K-9 Posse, a duo composed of his half-brother Vernon Lynch Jr. and Wardell Mahone.

"Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift's years-long friendship all started when they were dating Jonas brothers in the late '00s. Selena dated Nick from 2008 to 2010, while Taylor dated Joe in 2008—but was notoriously dumped in a phone call months later. Although those relationships didn't last, the one between Selena and Taylor remains stronger than ever.  ""We actually dated the Jonas Brothers together! It was hysterical,"" Gomez recalled her first time meeting Swift in a new radio interview with KIIS FM UK.  ""It was amazing, because she was the girl with the big curly hair and all the bracelets and the cowboy boots. And I was definitely up-and-coming, and we just clicked,"" she added. ""It was the best thing we got out of those relationships.""  They still keep in touch with the Jonases, however. ""They're lovely, by the way,"" Gomez said. ""We're all friends now. We were young, you know. It's a different time.""  This isn't Gomez's first time opening up about her and Swift's friendship. In March 2016, she said of her fellow star: ""I've known her for 10 years, she's been one of my best friends through thick and thin, walked by my side.""  She added that Swift is ""known for embracing her personal story and creating a beautiful thing out of it, and I was a little hesitant with that—and she was always the person to encourage me to tell my story and be proud of who I am.""  Swift showed the feeling was mutual while speaking to E! in May 2014. ""Both of us have kind of stuck it out and hung in there through all the different changes we've gone through,"" she said. The singer added that their friendship is ""the longest one I think either of us have had.""

Lil Peep died of an overdose of fentanyl and generic Xanax, according to the Pima Country Office of the Medical Examiner. The rapper’s death was ruled as accidental by the medical examiner.  TMZ reports that a cocktail of other drugs were also found in his system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol, and his urine tested positive for those drugs, as well as opiates such as hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone and oxymorphone. The medical examiner did not find alcohol in his system.  Peep, whose real name was Gustav Åhr, died last month in Tucson, Arizona, where he was supposed to hold a concert in support of his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One). He was 21. Local authorities speculated that the circumstances around the rapper’s death were “suspicious,” though at the time the Tucson police department was under the assumption his death was caused by a combination of Xanax and other drugs.  The authorities said they were investigating text messages sent by a woman who’d visited Peep’s tour bus before his death. “GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,” read one allegedly. Another supposedly read, “He passed the fuck out my brother called and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.”  A memorial for the rapper, who blended hip-hop with guitar-driven emo, was recently held in Long Beach, New York, featuring speakers and a public gathering.  In an interview with Pitchfork, the rapper said he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed taking drugs. “I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way,” He said. “I don’t like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.”	0
Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux shocked the world when they announced their split in February 2018. After seven years as a couple and two and a half years of marriage, we thought they finally got their happy ending.  Although they promised to “[continue] their cherished friendship” in the separation statement they released, we’re not so sure that’s the case anymore. Dark secrets have been revealed surrounding their divorce, including what they’re fighting over (page 6) and why Theroux’s rumored relationship with Selena Gomez is so messed up (page 8).  1. There were warning signs of their divorce  The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images  Looking back, maybe Aniston and Theroux’s divorce isn’t so surprising after all. As it turns out, there were some obvious warning signs leading up to their announcement.  Aniston was attending parties left and right without her husband, from her Friends co-star Courtney Cox’s birthday celebration in Malibu to Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding.  Theroux didn’t post any birthday wishes to Aniston on Feb. 11, 2018 — just four days before their separation announcement — whereas they’d typically share sweet messages on each other’s birthday.  Next: It’s been going on for a while.  2. They went through ‘intense issues’ for almost a year  Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images  According to E! News, Aniston and Theroux had been unhappy for quite some time. A source revealed that by the time of their split, they’d actually “been separated for two months.”  However, they “were having intense issues for about eight months.”  Next: They may not have ever been meant to be.  3. Their lifestyles were completely different  She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux seemed perfect for each other, but their lifestyles just weren’t compatible. E! News reported that Theroux prefered keeping a low profile, which just wasn’t possible when married to a Hollywood A-lister like Aniston.  A source confirmed, “Jennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.”    The source added, “The initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.”  Next: This played a major role in their split.  4. They couldn’t agree on where to live  He didn’t want to give up living in New York. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images He didn’t want to give up living in New York. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images  The couple’s different ideas on where to live reportedly became a major force in leading to their split. Aniston feels at home in Los Angeles, while Theroux wasn’t ready to give up his life in New York. A source told Entertainment Tonight, “[Theroux] much prefers being [in New York] and that’s been a major issue for them for a long time.”  While they reportedly tried giving New York a try, “she just never really could get settled in, she wasn’t happy.”  Next: You won’t believe what Theroux found.  5. Theroux found old love notes from Pitt  She kept notes from Brad Pitt. | Ucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images She kept notes from Brad Pitt. | Ucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images  For those of you hoping for Aniston to reunite with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, you may swoon over the fact that she kept old post-it notes with sweet messages from him all these years. Theroux, however, was unsurprisingly upset upon finding her keepsake collection.  A source told Us Weekly that when Theroux “stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” the impact was “huge.”  “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already,’” were among the love notes Theroux uncovered. His discovery left him with insecurities, which could have ultimately played a huge part in their split.  Next: They’ve been fighting over this since their split.  6. They’re fighting over the custody of their dogs  Neither wants to give up the dogs. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images Neither wants to give up the dogs. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux may have split amicably, but they don’t seem to be on the greatest terms anymore.

0WASHINGTON, D.C. –President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.“I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.0Commentscomments	1
"Ivana also proudly touted the fact that she has a ""direct number to the White House,"" but said she refrains from calling too often ""because Melania is there"" and she does not want to ""cause any kind of jealousy.""  Following so far?"	1
"CLOSE During an interview with 'Vanity Fair,' actress Angelina Jolie said life after splitting from husband Brad Pitt has been focused on looking after her health and her children. Wochit  Angelina Jolie attending the annual lecture of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation at the United Nations office in Geneva on March 15, 2017. (Photo: FABRICE COFFRINI, AFP/Getty Images)  Angelina Jolie is opening up about her difficult year, from a Bell's Palsy diagnosis to her split from Brad Pitt.  In a Vanity Fair cover story, Jolie reveals that in addition to high blood pressure, she developed Bell’s Palsy, a condition resulting from damage to facial nerves, which caused one side of her face to droop.  “Sometimes women in families put themselves last... until it manifests itself in their own health,"" Jolie, 42, said, credited acupuncture for a full recovery. Vanity Fair did not elaborate on the cause of the nerve damage.  Jolie, who underwent a hysterectomy in 2015 and a double mastectomy in 2013 after learning she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, also said she has been dealing with more gray hair and drier skin. ""I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had,"" she said.  Angelina Jolie opens up about putting her family first, life after Brad, health issues & her most personal film yet https://t.co/nKyf4dO8lspic.twitter.com/WkXCgWR1PV — VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) July 26, 2017  The year in question is when ""things got bad,"" as Jolie terms it to Vanity Fair, with Brad Pitt, saying trouble began in the summer of 2016 when her upcoming film First They Killed My Father was in postproduction.  ""Things became ‘difficult,'"" she told the magazine.  She is adamant, however, that the A-list couple's jet-set lifestyle with their six children was not ""in any way a negative.”  “That was not the problem,"" she said. ""That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children...They’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them.""  Jolie praised her children Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9 and Knox, 9, for being ""very brave"" during the divorce.  Divorce negotiations are still ongoing between the couple. As a family, Jolie says, she and the children are still recovering.  ""We’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing...They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some...from life, from things in life,"" she explained somewhat cryptically.  But the actress-director stays stoic in front of her children, Jolie said. “I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it’s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything’s going to be all right even when you’re not sure it is.”  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2v89EZm"	0
Season 14 of NBC’s hit singing reality competition show The Voice starts in only a few weeks, and there is already bad blood between veteran judge Blake Shelton and network executives. In fact, as RadarOnline.com previously reported, the country singer may be leaving the show after this year!  And according to production insider – all the drama started with Shelton’s lady love, Gwen Stefani!  As Radar readers know, Shelton, 41 – who has won 6 of the 13 seasons to date – started dating Stefani while the two starred alongside each other on season 9.

PHOTOS: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani Hold Hands In First Major Outing As Couple  Needless to say, producers ran with that and utilized the two for show ratings by giving them a massive bonus under the condition that they would pack on the PDA for all the world to see!  Unfortunately, they didn’t — and according to the source, “producers felt really shafted because they were told to bring the love, and instead they were unaffectionate.”  “They did one duet together the whole season, and seemed to be more jealous than in love with each other,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Getting Bonuses For PDA  According to the source, the drama heated up after season 12 ended, and the network announced that they were replacing Stefani with younger pop star Miley Cyrus, 25, and Jennifer Hudson, 36.  “Blake threw a fit when he found out that Gwen was not going to return and that she was replaced by Miley,” the source said, adding that the star “has been super resentful ever since.”  As fans know, Shelton was not a fan of Hudson either, and the two got into several heated fights on and off-camera!

Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Scott Stump  Bono has revealed he almost died during the making of U2's latest album, which explores the theme of mortality.  The 57-year-old lead singer reveals in the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine that the undisclosed ordeal contributed to the subject matter of their latest album, ""Songs of Experience.""  Bono revealed that enduring a near-death experience contributed to the songwriting on U2's latest album, ""Songs of Experience."" Getty Images  ""This political apocalypse was going on in Europe and in America, and it found a perfect rhyme with what was going on in my own life,'' he said. ""And I have had a hail of blows over the years. You get warning signs, and then you realize that you are not a tank, as (my wife) Ali says. Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.""  He did not want to discuss any details of the near-death experience.  ""It's just a thing that ... people have these extinction events in their lives; it could be psychological or it could be physical,'' he said. ""And, yes, it was physical for me, but I think I have spared myself all that soap opera.""  ""Especially with this kind of celebrity obsession with the minutiae of peoples' lives – I have got out of that,"" the singer explained. ""I want to speak about the issue in a way that lets people fill in the blanks of what they have been through, you know? It's one thing if you were talking about it in a place of record like Rolling Stone, but by the time it gets to your local tabloid it is just awful. It becomes the question that everyone is asking.""  It was the latest scare for Bono, who told Rolling Stone that doctors wanted to biopsy him for throat cancer in 2000 but thankfully everything ended up being fine. He also broke his arm in a bicycle crash in 2014 that he called a ""comic tragedy.""  ""But the thing that shook me was that I didn't remember it,'' he said about the accident. ""That was the amnesia; I have no idea how it happened. That left me a little uneasy, but the other stuff has just finally nailed me. It was like, 'Can you take a hint?'''  His undisclosed health issue meshed with themes he was already exploring on the latest album.  ""Well, strangely enough, mortality was going to be a subject anyway just because it is a subject not often covered,'' he said. ""And you can't write 'Songs of Experience' without writing about that. And I've had a couple of these shocks to the system, let's call them, in my life. Like my bike accident or my back injury. So it was always going to be the subject. I just didn't want to be such an expert in it.""  Follow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter."	0

"For other people named John Mahoney, see John Mahoney (disambiguation)  Charles John Mahoney (June 20, 1940 – February 4, 2018) was an English-American actor of stage, film, and television.  Born in Blackpool, England, Mahoney emigrated to the United States at the age of 18 and started his acting career on the stage in 1977, moving into film in 1980. He was best known for playing the blue-collar patriarch Martin Crane in the American sitcom Frasier, which aired on NBC from 1993 to 2004. In addition to his film and television work, Mahoney also worked as a voice actor and was particularly passionate about his stage work on Broadway and in Chicago theatre.  Early life [ edit ]  Mahoney was born in the Bispham area of Blackpool, England on June 20, 1940, the seventh of eight children. His paternal grandfather was Irish Catholic.[4][5]  The family had been evacuated to Blackpool from the Mahoneys' home city of Manchester, when it was heavily bombed during the Second World War. He started school at St Joseph's College, Blackpool. After the war, the family moved back to Manchester. Mahoney grew up in the Withington area of the city and discovered acting at the Stretford Children's Theatre. His father Reg was a baker[6] who played classical piano, and his mother Margaret (née Watson) was a housewife who loved reading. His parents' marriage was not happy and they either would not speak to each other or have heated arguments. The family situation, combined with the war, fueled Mahoney's interest in acting and he vowed to leave Manchester.[7][8]  Mahoney moved to the United States aged 18 in March 1959[9] when his older sister Vera, a war bride living in rural Illinois, agreed to sponsor him. He studied at Quincy University, Illinois, before joining the United States Army. After graduating from Quincy, he lived in Macomb, Illinois, earned his Master's degree in English [10]and taught English at Western Illinois University in the early 1970s,[11] before settling in Forest Park, Illinois, and later in Oak Park, Illinois. He became a US citizen in 1971[12] and served as editor of a medical journal through much of the 1970s.[11]  Career [ edit ]  Early work [ edit ]  Dissatisfied with his career, Mahoney took acting classes at St. Nicholas Theatre, which inspired him to resign from his day job and pursue acting full-time. After a stage production in Chicago in 1977, John Malkovich encouraged him to join the Steppenwolf Theatre.[13][14] He did so and went on to win the Clarence Derwent Award as Most Promising Male Newcomer. Gary Sinise said in an interview for Bomb Magazine that Lyle Kessler's play Orphans ""kicked John Mahoney, Kevin Anderson and Terry Kinney off into the movie business""[15] after their Steppenwolf performance of the play for which he won the Derwent Award and the Theatre World Award.[16] Mahoney won Broadway's Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves.[17]  Mahoney's first major film role was in the 1987 Barry Levinson film Tin Men. He went on to have prominent roles in a number of acclaimed films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, including Moonstruck, Eight Men Out, Say Anything..., In the Line of Fire, Reality Bites, and The American President.[17][18][11] He appeared in two Coen brothers films, Barton Fink[19] and The Hudsucker Proxy.[20]  Frasier [ edit ]  Mahoney appeared in Frasier from its debut in 1993 until the final episode in 2004; Mahoney received two Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations for the role of Martin Crane, the father of Frasier Crane and Niles Crane. NBC executives held Mahoney in such high esteem that Warren Littlefield declared he was pre-approved when the Frasier creative team suggested casting him as the father.[21] Prior to appearing on the series, Mahoney had appeared in an episode of Cheers – from which Frasier was a spin-off – as an inept jingle writer who has a brief conversation with Frasier. Mahoney also appeared as a priest in Becker, which starred Cheers star Ted Danson.  Voice acting [ edit ]  Mahoney voice acting on September 7, 2007  Mahoney's first voice job was in W. B. Yeats's ""The Words upon the Window-Pane"" for the award-winning National Radio Theater of Chicago. He provided the voices for several characters in Antz (1998), Preston Whitmore in Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Atlantis: Milo's Return, General Rogard in The Iron Giant (1999), and Papi in Kronk's New Groove (but was succeeded by Jeff Bennett in The Emperor's New School for an unknown reason). In 2007, Mahoney provided the voice of Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr. (Sideshow Bob's father) in The Simpsons episode ""Funeral for a Fiend."" This reunited him with his Frasier co-stars Kelsey Grammer (Sideshow Bob) and David Hyde Pierce (Cecil, Sideshow Bob's brother).  Post-Frasier [ edit ]  Mahoney co-starred as the Old Man in the Broadway revival of Prelude to a Kiss at the American Airlines Theater in a limited-run engagement running from previews on February 17, 2007, through to April 29, 2007.[22][23] He appeared as an elderly drag queen in the ER season 13 episode ""Somebody to Love,"" and co-starred with Steve Carell (himself a veteran of Chicago theatre) as the father of Carell's character in Dan in Real Life. In March 2008, he opened in the world premiere of Better Late at the Northlight Theatre.[24] He was also the narrator for Midwest Airlines commercials. Mahoney also made two appearances on USA's Burn Notice in the second (2009) and third (2010) season finales. His character, referred to only as ""Management,"" is a senior intelligence agency official who is the apparent main mover of the conspiracy which blacklisted Michael Westen.[25][26]  Mahoney joined the cast of In Treatment for the series' second season (2009) as a frenetic CEO who is overwhelmed by his personal and professional responsibilities and experiences chronic physical anxiety attacks. In 2010, he made a guest appearance on $#@! My Dad Says as homophobic retired naval officer Lt. Commander Wally Durham. Despite the numerous successes throughout his career, Mahoney has maintained that his early work in Lyle Kessler's play Orphans has ""affected people more than any other play I've ever done. I still get mail from it, I still get people stopping me on the street, and it's 20 years later.""[27]  Beginning in April 2011, Mahoney began rehearsing The Outgoing Tide, a new play by Bruce Graham at Northlight Theatre in Skokie, Illinois (suburban Chicago). The play also stars fellow Chicago actors Rondi Reed and Thom Cox. In 2011, he had two guest appearances on Hot in Cleveland as Roy, a waiter and a love interest for Betty White's character Elka.[28] This reunited him with his Frasier co-star Jane Leeves, as well as Wendie Malick whose character he eventually married in Frasier and his co-star in the movie The American President. Mahoney was a featured ensemble cast member in The Birthday Party, playing in Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre from January 24 to April 28, 2013.[29] Mahoney portrayed his last role in the play The Rembrandt, from September to November 2017.[30]  Personal life [ edit ]  Along with David Hyde Pierce, Mahoney was godfather to Frasier co-star Jane Leeves' son Finn.[31] Mahoney rarely spoke publicly about his private life,[7] but in a 2002 article he revealed he had been in several relationships, although he had never married, citing his parents' unhappy marriage as something he feared he would repeat.[8] He suffered from colon cancer in the mid-1980s and felt unable to have sex following a colostomy.[32] His Catholic faith was at the center of his life and work.[33][34]  Mahoney lived in Oak Park, Illinois.[8]  Death [ edit ]  Mahoney died in a Chicago hospice on February 4, 2018, of complications from throat cancer, originally diagnosed in 2014. He was 77 years old. According to his friend Anna Shapiro: ""He was fragile and he was supposed to be having a routine procedure. But having just beat Stage 3 throat cancer, I think he was just too weak… By the time he did The Rembrandt he was clean of cancer... But other health issues came up and he was just too fragile.""[35][36][37][38][39]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]"	0
If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband.	0

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle’s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea."""	1
All bittersweet things must come to an end.  FXX announced that Stephen Falk's relationship comedy, You're the Worst, will be granted a fifth and final season to air in 2018. The announcement came November 15 - the same day as You're the Worst season 4's finale  FX co-President of Original programming Nick Grad said in a statement:  “Stephen Falk has been an extraordinary creative partner to work with over the past four years, and it is in that spirit that we came to the mutual decision to end You’re the Worst with its fifth season. Stephen’s singular vision for the series has been its guiding force from the start and our decision, while difficult, will allow the series to end on its own terms and in a way most satisfying to its devoted fans. We want to thank Stephen, the cast and the crew for everything they’ve done to make You’re the Worst one of the best comedies on TV.”  It may be a bit early to eulogoize You're the Worst (seasons tend to run in the Fall so we're about a year away from the series finale in all likelihood) but while we have the time, Gad is right: this was one of the better comedies on TV. What initially seemed to be a comedy about shitty people falling into something approximating love, You're the Worst evolved into a sophisticated exploration of mental illness, self-destruction, and general human imperfection.  Chris Geere and Aya Cash excelled as star-crossed lovers Jimmy and Gretchen and Desmin Borges, Kether Donohue, and Janet Varney round out the cast as Angelenos all damaged in their own way.  “Making You’re The Worst has been an incredible experience and FX Networks have been dream partners,” creator Stephen Falk said. “I am thankful to have the opportunity to be thoroughly judged whether or not we ‘stick the landing’ -- which is a thing people say now that stupid Breaking Bad had to end so damn perfectly.”  You know what that means. Jimmy and Gretchen are returning to Albuquerque for bloody revenge. Get ready!  You're the Worst Season 5 Release Date  FXX has announced the premiere date for You're the Worst's final season. You're the Worst Season 5 will premiere Wednesday, January 9 at 10 p.m. ET.  You're the Worst Season 5 Trailer  And here's the trailer!	0

"Kimberly Noel Kardashian West[1] (; born October 21, 1980) is an American reality television personality, entrepreneur and socialite. Kardashian first gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but received wider notice after a 2003 sex tape with her former boyfriend Ray J was leaked in 2007. Later that year, she and her family began to appear in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success soon led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. Kardashian's personal life soon became subject to widespread media attention.[2]  In recent years, Kardashian has grown an influential online and social media presence, including tens of millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram.[3][4][5] She has released a variety of products tied to her name, including the successful 2014 mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a variety of clothing and products, and the 2015 photo book Selfish. Her relationship with rapper Kanye West has also received significant media coverage; the couple married in 2014 and they have three children together.[6]  Time magazine included Kardashian on their list of 2015's 100 most influential people,[7] while Vogue described her in 2016 as a ""pop culture phenomenon.""[8] Critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous.[9][10][11] She was reported to be the highest-paid reality television personality of 2015, with her total earnings exceeding US$53 million.[12]  Early life  Kardashian was born on October 21, 1980 in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Robert and Kris (née Houghton).[13] She has an older sister, Kourtney, a younger sister, Khloé, and a younger brother, Rob.[14] Their mother is of Dutch, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry,[15] while their father was a third-generation Armenian-American.[16] After their parents divorced in 1991, her mother married again that year, to Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner),[A] the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner.[17] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained step-brothers Burton ""Burt"", Brandon, and Brody; step-sister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner.[18]  She attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles.[19] In 1994, her father represented football player O. J. Simpson during his murder trial. Simpson is Kardashian's godfather.[20] Kardashian's father died in 2003 of cancer.[21] In her 20s, Kardashian was the close friend and stylist of socialite Paris Hilton, through whom she first garnered media attention.[3][22]  Career  2007–2009: Breakthrough with reality television  In February 2007, a sex tape made by Kardashian and Ray J in 2003 was leaked.[23][24] Kardashian filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment, who distributed the film as Kim K Superstar. She later dropped the suit and settled for a reported US$5 million.[25][26] In October 2007 Kardashian, in addition to her mother Kris Jenner, her step-parent Caitlyn Jenner (Bruce), her siblings Kourtney, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian, and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, began to appear in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[27] The series proved successful for E!, and has led to the creations of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Kim Take Miami.[28] In one of the episodes, Kim discussed an offer from Playboy to appear nude in the magazine.[29] That December, Kardashian posed for a nude pictorial for Playboy.[30]  In 2008, she made her feature film debut in the disaster film spoof Disaster Movie, in which she appeared as a character named Lisa.[31][32] That same year, she was a participant on season seven of Dancing with the Stars, where she was partnered with Mark Ballas. Kardashian was the third contestant to be eliminated.[33] In January 2009, Kardashian made a cameo appearance during an episode of the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, in the episode ""Benefits"". In April, she released a workout DVD series through her television production company Kimsaprincess Productions, LLC which has seen the release of three successful workout videos, Fit in Your Jeans by Friday, with trainers Jennifer Galardi and Patrick Goudeau.[34][35][36] Kardashian played Elle in four episodes of the television series Beyond the Break.[37]  Kardashian became a guest host of WrestleMania XXIV and guest judge on America's Next Top Model in August of that year.[38] In September, Fusion Beauty and Seven Bar Foundation launched ""Kiss Away Poverty"", with Kardashian as the face of the campaign. For every LipFusion lipgloss sold, US$1 went to the Foundation to fund women entrepreneurs in the US.[39] The following month, she released her first fragrance self-titled ""Kim Kardashian"".[40][41] In December 2009, Kardashian made a guest star appearance on CBS's CSI: NY with Vanessa Minnillo.[42][43]  2010: Early endorsements and retail ventures  2010 saw Kardashian venture into several new endorsement deals, including endorsing various food products for Carl's Jr.[44][45] In January 2010, she starred as Summa Eve in the film Deep in the Valley.[42] In April, Kardashian sparked controversy over the way she held a kitten for a photograph, holding it by the scruff of its neck.[46] With sisters Kourtney and Khloé, Kardashian is involved in the retail and fashion industries. They have launched several clothing collections and fragrances. Animal rights organization PETA criticized Kardashian for repeatedly wearing fur coats, and named her as one of the five worst people or organizations of 2010 when it came to animal welfare.[47] June saw Kardashian guest star with Khloé and Kourtney as themselves on the season three premiere episode of the series 90210.[48]  That same month, Kardashian was involved in a lawsuit against one of her endorsements. Sanford Siegal, the creator of the Cookie Diet, sued Kardashian, claiming she defamed him on Twitter. According to Siegal, Kardashian tweeted in October 2009 that he was ""falsely promoting"" that she was on the cookie diet. Siegal filed a claim in a Florida state court charging that her statements were false and defamatory. He also alleged that Kardashian was on QuickTrim's payroll when she posted the tweet. Kardashian's tweet appears to stem from an article on CookieDiet.com, that named Kardashian as one of many celebrities who saw positive results on the diet. Kardashian sent a cease-and-desist order to Siegal, demanding the link be removed.[49]  On July 1, 2010, the New York City branch of Madame Tussauds revealed a wax figure of Kardashian.[50] In November, Kardashian served as producer for The Spin Crowd, a reality television show about Command PR, a New York City public relations firm, run by Jonathan Cheban and Simon Huck. The show followed them as they settle into their new offices in Los Angeles. That month, she also appeared on season ten of The Apprentice.[51][52] Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé wrote an autobiography titled Kardashian Konfidential, which was released in stores on November 23, and appeared on New York Times's Best Seller List.[53]  In December 2010, Kardashian filmed a music video for a song titled ""Jam (Turn It Up)"". The video was directed by Hype Williams; Kanye West makes a cameo in the video.[54] Kardashian premiered the song during a New Year's Eve party at TAO Las Vegas on December 31, 2010.[55] The song was produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, ""There's no album in the works or anything—just one song we did for Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's and one of my parents passed away from cancer. It's just all having fun—with a good cause"".[56] Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a ""dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature,"" and suggested that the single made Kardashian the ""worst singer in the reality TV universe.""[57]  That month, the International Business Times reported that Kardashian's 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, estimating them at $6 million.[58][59]  As of November 2016, as per CBC Marketplace and interviews with celebrity endorsement experts, Kim Kardashian was paid between $75,000 and $300,000 for each post that she posted on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter endorsing beauty products like waist trainers, teeth whiteners as well as Coca-Cola and well known charities. Experts think that celebrities offer fake glimpses into their lives to make viewers fall for their advertising pitches, curated to look as though the viewer is catching them in a spontaneous moment when they are mostly staged.[60]  2011–2015: Legal issues and focus on social media  Kardashian in Australia for the E! News: Red carpet and dinner in 2012  In April 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance ""Gold"".[40] Also in 2011, she filed a $20 million lawsuit against Old Navy and its parent company, Gap Inc. for right of publicity.[61] Old Navy used actress/model Melissa Molinaro in their Old Navy commercial featuring the actress singing and dancing. Kim Kardashian claimed that Old Navy used Molinaro as a look alike to Kim in order to promote their brand. Kim Kardashian was also seeking order to have the actress/model Molinaro banned from Old Navy commercials. The lawsuit never went to trial but a settlement was reached by use of a mediator in 2012; the exact settlement is unknown.[61]  In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled ""True Reflection"", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote.[62] That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse.[63] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim's manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[64] In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.[65][66] In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, ""Glam"", which ""draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle"", and was made available through Debenhams.[67] In summer of 2012, Kardashian and her family filmed a music video in the Dominican Republic to Notorious B.I.G's song ""Hypnotize"".[68]  Kardashian in September 2014  Kardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in Paper's winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude.[69] On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: ""Break the Internet"", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.[70][71] The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera.[72][73] A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and ""trying to tear down"" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was ""just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise.""[74] However, the stunt ""set a new benchmark"" in social media response,[75] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[76][77]  Kardashian voiced the role of an alien in an episode of the adult animated series American Dad!, in season 11 (2014–15) in the episode titled ""Blagsnarst, A Love Story"" on September 21, 2014. In the episode, her character crash-lands in the town of Langley Falls. The alien then develops an attraction to her fellow alien Roger.[78][79]  In June 2014, Kardashian released a mobile game for iPhone and Android called Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet.[80] The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in-game items.[81] The game was a hit, earning US$1.6 million in its first five days of release.[81] In July, the game's developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store.[81] In May 2015, Kardashian released a portfolio book called Selfish, a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself.[82] In December 2015, Kardashian released an emoji pack for iOS devices called Kimoji.[83] The app was a best-seller, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps that week.[83] In August 2015, Kardashian was the cover model for Vogue Spain.[84]  2016–present  On October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry.[85] The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag.[86] Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life.[87][88][89] She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped.[90] On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed ""on hold indefinitely"" after the robbery.[91] Production resumed on October 26.[92] Kardashian postponed a makeup demonstration in Dubai due to the incident.[93]  Kardashian made a cameo appearance in the heist film Ocean's 8, which was released on June 8, 2018.[94][95]  Fashion ventures  Kardashian is one of the many celebrity turned entrepreneurs who are able to leverage their television success by launching profitable side businesses. Kardashian is the founder of the television production company, Kimsaprincess Productions LLC, which produces workout DVDs, launched an eponymous fragrance line and the e-commerce shoe shopping website, ShoeDazzle. With her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, she also owns and is expanding D-A-S-H clothing boutiques, designed a clothing line for Bebe and nabbed diet (Quick Trim) and skincare (PerfectSkin) products endorsements.[96][97]  In 2006, Kardashian entered the business world with her two sisters and opened the boutique shop D-A-S-H in Calabasas, California.[34] In 2007, Kardashian and three partners Brian Lee, Robert Shapiro and MJ Eng founded ShoeDazzle, an online shoe and accessories website. The site now boasts more than 3 million customers, who pay a monthly fee for access to a personalized selection of shoes, jewelry and handbags every month. The site also landed a $40-million investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.[98] The company is valued at $280 million as of 2012.[99][100][101][102] In March 2009, she launched an endorsement with her company, ShoeDazzle shopping,[103] of which she is the co-founder and chief fashion stylist.[44] She then endorsed multiple other projects including a vanilla cupcake mix flavor called 'Va-Va-Va-Nilla' for the bakery, Famous Cupcakes.[44]  Beginning in early 2010, Kardashian and her sisters designed and developed clothing lines for Bebe stores and 'Virgins, Saints, and Angels'.[104][105][106] In April 2010, Kardashian and her sisters released a sunless tanner ""Kardashian Glamour Tan"", that month.[107] In October 2011, Kardashian and her sisters opened their Kardashian Khaos store in Las Vegas.[108] In November 2012, Kardashian and her sisters internationally launched the 'Kardashian Kollection' in England,[109][110] as well as launching a line of cosmetics, 'Khroma Beauty'.[111]  Personal life  Marriages  In 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[112] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later blamed their separation on physical and emotional abuse on his part,[113] and said she was high on ecstasy during the ceremony.[114] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[112]  In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[115] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[116] Earlier that month, she had released her ""wedding fragrance"" called ""Kim Kardashian Love"" which coincided with her own wedding.[40][117] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding.[118] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[119] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[120] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case which included an apology from Jaxson.[121] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[122] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[123]  Kardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[124] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[125] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[126] and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[127] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[128] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[129] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as ""a historic blizzard of celebrity.""[6]  Religion  Kim Kardashian is a Christian and has described herself as ""really religious"".[130] Each morning, she and her family partake in a group chat in which they discuss a daily verse from the Bible.[130] She was educated in Christian schools of both the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions.[130]  In April 2015, Kardashian and West traveled to the Armenian Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem to have their daughter, North, baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church. The ceremony took place at the Cathedral of St. James.[131] Khloe Kardashian was appointed the godmother of North.[132]  Health and pregnancies  Kardashian gave birth to her first child with West, daughter North West, on June 15, 2013.[133] She gave birth to her second child, son Saint West, on December 5, 2015.[134] Kardashian has been very open about her difficult pregnancies. With her first pregnancy, she suffered preeclampsia, which forced her to deliver at 34 weeks. She also suffered placenta accreta after delivery, eventually having to have surgery to remove the placenta and subsequent scar tissue.[135] After her second pregnancy, her doctors advised against trying to become pregnant again.[136] The couple's third child, a daughter, was born via surrogate on January 15, 2018.[137] On January 19, 2018, her name was announced as Chicago West.[138][139]  Kardashian began suffering from psoriasis at the age of 30.[140] She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in late 2017.[141]  Wealth  As of May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45 million.[142] In 2015, Forbes reported she had ""made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million"", and reported that she ""has monetized fame better than any other"".[143] Much of her income include wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which raked in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored Instagram and Twitter posts which are collectively worth $10,000–25,000 per post.[144] As of July 2018, Kim is worth US$350 Million[145]  Advocacy  Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry.[146][147] She is not a citizen of either country and cannot speak Armenian.[148] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[149][150][151]  In April 2015, she traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khloé, and her daughter North and visited the Armenian Genocide memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan.[152] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[153] During an interview with GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Democrat, and declared support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential Election.[154]  Kardashian has also worked in the area of prison reform, advocating for the commutation of the sentence of Chris Young, and also of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense, which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018.[155][156]  Filmography  As herself  As actress  Music videos  Discography  List of singles, with selected chart positions Title Year Peak chart  positions Album US  [176] US  Heat.

Pippa Middleton knows what it’s like to have someone steal the spotlight at a wedding – in part, because she herself did exactly that at her own sister’s wedding. Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton‘s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa’s dress than Kate’s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.  Since then, Pippa’s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride – and in this particular circumstance, it’s almost a given that it will happen to her.  According to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry’s friend’s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry’s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she’s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.  Sources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.”  According to the same source, Pippa is now employing a “no ring, no guest” policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses – which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it’s Prince Harry we’re talking about, you think he wouldn’t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law’s wedding, given that he took her to a friend’s wedding?  What do you guys think? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Image credit to Meghan Markle // via Instagram	1

Now, it’s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use “unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII” and assuring fans that “we were never going to recast, or use a CG character.” While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher — or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa — will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia’s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can’t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there’s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D’Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she’s very much in “harried leader” mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we’ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It’s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams’ comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that’s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they’ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm — and Fisher’s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams’ statement — want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they’re courting backlash if this isn’t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It’s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology — and loved Fisher as a person — as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.	1

"Sarah Jessica Parker is getting candid about her relationship with husband Matthew Broderick.  The 52-year-old actress appears on the latest episode of Girlboss Radio hosted by Sophia Amoruso, where she talks about her longtime marriage with Broderick. The two have been married for 20 years and share three kids together -- son James, and twin daughters Marion Loretta and Tabitha.  Parker says her and the 55-year-old Broderick's busy careers are actually beneficial to their marriage.  ""I know this sounds nuts, but we have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,"" she explains. ""His work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that that's been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share in a way... anytime that any relationship is hard, it's the point in which you're deciding, is this worth the investment getting through whatever that thing is?""  ""Relationships are hard. I always felt that I wanted to invest more,"" she continues. ""I love him, and I think he's brilliant. I'm sure I annoy him. He annoys me sometimes. I'm enormously proud of the person he is. I think the longer you can last, the more invested you just are.""  Later, Parker gets candid about how motherhood has changed her.  ""You're in a constant state of worrying about your children,"" she admits. ""It's very painful and it's exhilarating. It's a really interesting way of living in the world. I read books differently, or I look at parents and children on the subway differently. I hear music differently, or when I see something, I think, 'I wish Tabitha and Loretta were with me now and they could see this.' That's the good part.""  Of course, there have been a few hardships.  ""It's not for everybody, there's a lot that's really hard,"" she says bluntly. ""It's exhausting and you're basically just cleaning up after people all day. You're one big, good, old-fashioned secretary.

Kim Kardashian got the best Christmas present ever — her psoriasis disappeared!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 37-year-old star has always been open about her struggle with the skin condition on social media and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and it’s been a constant battle for the star. But after trying tons of different remedies, Kardashian finally found something that’s working.  This morning, Kardashian woke up to the best gift she could receive and showed fans her near-perfect skin on her Instagram story.  “OMG my psoriasis is almost gone! Best Christmas present!” she captioned the shot of her legs.  Donato Sardella/Getty Images for The Tot  Looking for more style content?

When we caught up with the star in November leading up to the launch of her KKW Fragrances, Kardashian revealed her psoriasis was slowly improving and more than halfway gone.  Kim Kardashian/Instagram  “I have been using this light — and I don’t wanna speak to soon because [the psoriasis] is almost gone — but I’ve been using this light [therapy] and my psoriasis is like 60 percent gone,” Kardashian told us. “That’s wild because it hasn’t been gone in years.”  RELATED PHOTOS: 10 Beauty Products Kim Kardashian’s Obsessing Over Right Now  Her secret weapon’s the Baby Quasar at-home LED light therapy system, which is a nearly $600 device that Kardashian said she started using on her psoriasis in an interview with Into the Gloss in 2015.  More than a year later in 2016, Kardashian shared on app that she’s learned to accept living with the skin condition.  “I have that one patch on my right leg that is the most visible,” Kardashian West, 35, says in a post on her app. “I don’t even really try to cover it that much anymore. Sometimes I just feel like it’s my big flaw and everyone knows about it, so why cover it? After this many years, I’ve really learned to live with it.”  When Kardashian first discovered the psoriasis appearing on her legs in 2011 captured on an episode of KUWTK, she wasn’t as accepting of the diagnosis.  The star visited Dr. Harold Lancer and once he confirmed she had psoriasis, Kardashian said, “When the doctor tells me I have psoriasis I have heard of it before because my mom has always had it. But my mom didn’t have red, flaky dots all over her.”  She immediately worried about how psoriasis would affect her career in the spotlight.  “My career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots. People don’t understand the pressure on me to look perfect,” Kardashian said. “Imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots.”	0
It's too early to tell if the film is even gonna happen, but it's not looking good for A.  Our insider says Kristen was approached to fill Jolie's hot-woman void in the franchise and met at least once with Timur Bekmambetov, the director of the series.  However, Angelina's participation in the project is still up in the air.  While her character died in the first installment of the film, Bekmambetov told MTV that he would bring her back in some capacity, in the sequel.  Only problem is A.J. reportedly backed out of the film. We hear details (aka money and exactly how much time she'd need to give to the flick) were never worked out, which is why Angelina is out, for now—but she could possibly make a cameo if the film actually happens.  So can Kristen save the franchise?  Our dishy source says the Stewart-McAvoy version of the project might not come to fruition, but it remains a slim possibility—and wouldn't it be damn hot! (Sure would be a lot happier news than that horrible fake car accident stuff which had K.Stew fans in a tizzy yesterday.)  Kristen is set to start filming Breaking Dawn possibly as early as October, while the Wanted follow-up was originally slated to start shooting around the end of August.  No production date has been set in stone for the final Twilight flick(s), which is making it difficult, we're told, for many of the actors involved in the vampire franchise to figure out their schedule allowed for outside projects. Anyone remember Rachelle Lefevre?  Be careful before you sign up for other projects, dearies!  Neither Bekmambetov nor a rep for Stewart responded to E!'s request for comment. While no offer was officially given to Kristen, word is that Bekmambetov is—for now—looking at other projects for the fall, given the scheduling conflicts.  Bummer! Nobody kicks ass like K.Stew.	1
It’s official.  Almost two years after announcing their decision to split, Yolanda Hadid and David Foster are divorced. According to legal documents obtained by The Blast, a judgment was entered in court Oct. 16.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  After four years of marriage and a total of nine years together, the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star and music producer announced their divorce exclusively to PEOPLE on Dec. 1, 2015.  “Sadly we have decided to go our separate ways,” they said in a statement at the time. “We’ve shared nine beautiful and joyous years together. During that time we experienced love, friendship and the inevitable challenges that come with managing a marriage, careers, blended families and health issues.”  Hadid, 53, who was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012, has been open about the strain her health struggles put on their marriage as symptoms like joint pain, exhaustion, insomnia, and anxiety plagued her daily, making simple tasks like answering an email extremely difficult.  “All of a sudden all of the things we shared, all of the things we used to love to do together — go for walks in the morning, having a studio in the house and blasting music all day, having dinner parties — that all shut down,” she told PEOPLE in August. “I couldn’t participate in that life anymore.”  RELATED VIDEO: Yolanda Hadid Reveals How Lyme Disease Devastated Her Life & Marriage in Memoir  Hadid also opened up about the toll the illness took on her marriage in her September memoir, Believe Me: My Battle With the Invisibility of Lyme Disease.  “I’m starting to feel that David is unhappy with the fact that I can’t be by his side the way that I used to be,” she wrote. “I try to make light of it and joke that he married a lemon. It’s sad but true. I went from being the funny girlfriend who was up for anything and had endless energy to the wife who is too sick to be by his side.”  “He lost his wingman, his partner in crime, and I fell as if he’s starting to get impatient with my recovery,” she continued. “I understand that even brief periods of illness can strain important relationships in your life. A chronic condition like mine, one that has consumed years of our lives, poses enormous challenges.”  Despite her best efforts, she was unable to maintain her former lifestyle. After the couple split, Hadid left Los Angeles, relocating to New York to be closer to her three children: models Gigi, Bella and Anwar.  “I had a great run with him,” she previously told PEOPLE of her ex-husband. “I will always hold that in high regard and have gratitude for that time together.”  Foster, 67, opened up about the divorce at the Grammy Museum’s third annual gala in Los Angeles last month.  “We just always did our best,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “We had some other issues as well, but everybody’s in a good place now. The main thing is that she’s healthy and in remission. She worked really hard at it and now she’s reaping the rewards of that.”	0

Atlanta, Georgia has been known for it’s population of homesexual African American men for the past few years, but until recently, this popular opinion was simply a stereotype.Following the release of “Dr. Satan’s White Van”, Tommy Wiseau’s latest movie, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia State University students began a study assessing the sexuality of the male population of the city with surprising results.​The study divided the population into categories of black, white, Asian, and oreo, then divided them further into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.​Reactions to the study included both joy and fear as both men and women across the country expressed happiness in the openness of the men surveyed or fear of the “rising number of gays,” says Rednecks Against Being Homo chairwoman Natasha Tarwater.​BDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe of Atlanta, while walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, said,	1

"David Cassidy, the teen heartthrob star of the hit ""The Partridge Family"" who went on to have a long show business career although he battled alcoholism later in life, is dead, his publicist said Tuesday. He was 67. Cassidy died surrounded by his family, his publicist said. Cassidy's nephew tweeted that he didn't think ""I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him.""  My uncle David Cassidy has sadly passed away tonight... & in the process of mourning I can't help but thank God for the joy that he brought to countless millions of people! I don't think I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him. God Speed! — Jack Cassidy (@jackgcassidy) November 22, 2017  Cassidy said in February that he was suffering from dementia.  ""I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,"" he told People magazine about his diagnosis. His mother had suffered from the disease.  Cassidy was born in 1950 to singer and actor Jack Cassidy and actress Evelyn Ward. His big break came at age 20 when he nabbed the role of Keith Partridge, one of the singing kids of ""The Partridge Family,"" alongside his real-life stepmother Shirley Jones.  The show centered around a widow and her five children who traveled the country in a psychedelically-painted school bus. It ran from 1970-74, providing a feel-good, family show as the country struggled to find its footing after the tumultuous 1960s.  While ""The Partridge Family"" was never a huge hit in the ratings, the show excelled in tie-ins and producing hit songs. The theme song ""Come On, Get Happy"" became a hit, and the cast would later go on to make ten albums, all of which sold more than 1 million copies.

AP  And Cassidy was the biggest star of them all. He went solo in 1971, with his song ""Cherish,"" becoming a No. 1 hit. He had pop-star good looks and the 1970s trademark shaggy hair, helping fuel his teen idol status. He posed shirtless on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1972 with the headline ""Naked Lunch Box."" He tried to reject his ""bubble-gum"" image, talking about his drug use (""not smack, but grass and speed and psychedelics"").  Cassidy sold out Madison Square Garden in one day and toured internationally. But at London's White City Stadium, a 14-year-old girl was killed in a stampede when the 35,000 crowd surged forward when he appeared on stage. One ambulance man said the scene reminded him of the Blitz, according to The Independent.  By the end of 1974, ""The Partridge Family"" had ended and Cassidy quit touring, ending his days as a pop star. He eventually climbed back to the Top 40 with the 1990's ""Lyin' to Myself.""

It's official - Jane Fonda has confirmed plans for herself, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin to return for a sequel to their movie, 9 to 5!  Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are ready to punch the clock once again as a sequel to their 1980 comedy 9 to 5 is in the works. According to Entertainment Weekly, Fonda revealed plans for the trio to team up for a modern revival.  “My role is as an executive producer, and I’m working with the writers, with Lily, and talking to the writers,” Fonda told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel. “Right now, Dolly, Lily and I are all intending to be in it.”  The film, said Fonda, will tackle current issues in the workplace like changing technology and corporate voyeurism.  “I’m sorry to say the situation is worse today,” she said. “Today a lot of the workforce is hired by an outside company. Who do you talk to if you have a problem?”  Rumors of a remake swirled earlier this year when it was revealed that Rashida Jones and the original screenwriter, Patricia Resnick, teamed up to co-write a script. At the time, Parton was eager to reprise her role for a follow-up film.  “All these years we’ve talked about doing a sequel to 9 to 5 and it never made any real sense until just recently,” Parton said to Entertainment Weekly previously. “We decided that we are going to do another one. We are trying to get the script and all that, everyone is very interested and we’ve all agreed that we’d love to do it if it’s right.”  Added Parton, “I told them we better get after it or it’s going to be 95 instead of 9 to 5.”  No word on when production for 9 to 5 will begin for Parton, but in the meantime, the Tennessee native has her hands full with several major projects. In addition to acting, Parton’s production company, Dixie Pixie Productions, has teamed up with Warner Bros. Television and Netflix to create eight original films based on her music. The films are set to air on Netflix in 2019.	0
A CONTROVERSIAL reality TV star has courted controversy after admitting that she used drugs while pregnant with her daughter less than a year after admitting she nearly died of a heroin overdose.  Jenelle Evans’ past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she’s “not a bad kid any more”, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin “four or five times a day”.  “I was hooked,” she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  “I’m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,” the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  “I said, ‘I did within the past 30 days,’” she explained.  “I said, ‘I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can’t eat.’ And they said, ‘OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.’”  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.  But then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out “haters online saying that I abuse my kids”.  Despite promising she’s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren’t so sure.  All jokes aside, someone should go to the land and make sure that those kids (more so Kaiser) are in a safe situation. They do not deserve to be witnessing what’s more than likely going on in their home.. #SaveKaiser #TeenMom2 #TeenMomOG #JenelleEvans #DavidEason — leeeasha (@leashaboo89) February 21, 2018  “First of all, if I were on drugs I wouldn’t be able to sit here in the morning and get the kids ready and eat healthily. Or I’d be losing a lot of weight,” Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  “I was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,” she told Us Weekly last year,  “I basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  “I really was so close to dying.”  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as “worst flu I’ve ever had for seven days”.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was “disowned” by family and friends.  “It hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn’t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,” she wrote in her memoir.  “The drugs always made the pain go away. They didn’t turn on me or betray me. I guess heroin was my first steady, dependable lover. It gave me what I needed to live and I gave it my life. By this entry, heroin was the only thing I had in my life that loved me.”  According to Kidspot, a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that the rate of pregnant women using marijuana has increased 62 per cent  Marijuana is the “most widely used illicit drug among all pregnant women”, the website claims, and said there is “some cause for concern” of the effects of marijuana on a foetus.  “Infants of women who used marijuana during pregnancy were more likely to be anaemic, have lower birth weight, and require placement in neonatal intensive care than infants of mothers who did not use marijuana,” Dr Nora Volkow wrote in a paper, The Risks of Marijuana Use During Pregnancy, for the JAMA Network.  — Continue the conversation with Matt Young on Facebook or Twitter.	0

Fans of The Walking Dead had to say farewell to yet another of their favorite characters Sunday night. In a year in which we’ve lost Carl (Chandler Riggs), Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and possibly Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Jesus (Tom Payne) breathed his last. In typical heroic fashion, he died trying to get others to safety.  While on a mission to rescue Eugene (Josh McDermott) with Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand), the group found themselves in a graveyard with a new foe approaching. After fighting off a few walkers with ninja-like skill, Jesus took one last swing of the sword only to have the would-be walker duck, then stab him in the back. Other than Eugene and Rosita, this was the group’s first encounter with the Whisperers, living humans hiding among the dead.  Fans did not take Jesus’s death lightly.  Though many mourn, Payne was ready for his stint on the show to end. He said in a recent interview that he had become frustrated and bored with the character’s storyline.  The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.

She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company."""	1
Former Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron is being criticized on social media after making controversial comments about Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.  In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, September 8, the evangelical Christian spoke out about the disasters.  “How should we look at two giant hurricanes coming back-to-back like this?” the 46-year-old said in the clip recorded at the airport in Orlando, Florida. “Do we write them off as coincidence? Do we write it off as a statistical anomaly? Wow! Who would’ve thought? Is it just Mother Nature in a bad mood? I don’t know how you think about it but I think it could be something much more than all of that.”  He then quoted a section from the Bible and said that hurricanes are “a spectacular display of God’s immense power.”  “When he puts his power on display, it’s never without reason,” he continued. “There’s a purpose. And we may not always understand what that purpose is, but we know it’s not random and we know that weather is sent to cause us to respond to God in humility, awe and repentance.”  The video has been shared more than 5,000 times and has attracted more than 3,000 comments, some agreeing with his opinion, others dissenting strongly.  “Amazing. He actually thinks a god murders people with weather events, in order to teach them humility. Kirk has an impressively twisted mind,” one wrote.  “Tape your mouth shut idiot,” another commented.  “God doesn’t cause hurricanes Dave,” another wrote. “Heat, wind and water do.”  “So let me get this straight, your magical sky wizard sent the hurricanes that HAVE ALREADY KILLED PEOPLE as a display of his love? #notmygod,” another commenter wrote.  The death toll from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston and dumped several feet of rain on southeast Texas, has risen to at least 70.  Irma has swept through the Caribbean, killing at least 23 people and bringing catastrophic devastation to several islands including Barbuda, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands and Cuba. Six million Florida residents were ordered to evacuate before the first effects of Irma were felt in the Florida Keys on Saturday, bringing winds of 125 mph. The eye of the storm is expected to hit the Sunshine State on Sunday.  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

First of all, Charlize Theron’s hair has grown out to the point where she and Ellen DeGeneres could be twinsies, right? This is Ellen’s hair completely. Secondly (and more importantly), these are photos of Charlize out to dinner at Matsuhisa with her new boyfriend, Seth McFarlane. Did I jump the gun by calling Seth her boyfriend? Eh. According to sources, Seth and Charlize met in January for business-related stuff (she signed on to his planned western/spoof A Million Ways To Die In the West), then spent some social time together late in the awards season, partied together after the Oscars and now it looks like the rumors were true – they are together!  These were taken last night in West Hollywood, and Seth and Charlize came out of a sushi place. Note how Charlize is hiding her face in some of these pics? Do you think that’s just her natural reticence or is she actually shame-dating Seth and she doesn’t want people to know? My general thought on Charlize is that she would never shame-date someone. If Charlize is going to take the trouble to bang you, she doesn’t mind if people know. More likely she’s hiding her face because she just didn’t want to be photographed at that moment or whatever. And whatever she has going with Seth is barely a month old, so it is a little early to be so public, you know? You can see more photos of Seth and Charlize here.	1

"Madeleine Beth McCann (born 12 May 2003) disappeared on the evening of 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal, sparking what one newspaper called ""the most heavily reported missing-person case in modern history"".[3] Her whereabouts remain unknown.[4]  Madeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann; her two-year-old twin siblings; and a group of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 55 metres (180 ft) away.[5] The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 because of a lack of evidence.[6][7]  The parents continued the investigation using private detectives until Scotland Yard opened its own inquiry, Operation Grange, in 2011. The senior investigating officer announced that he was treating the disappearance as ""a criminal act by a stranger"", most likely a planned abduction or burglary gone wrong.[8] In 2013, Scotland Yard released e-fit images of men they wanted to trace, including one of a man seen carrying a child toward the beach that night.[9] Shortly after this, the Portuguese police reopened their inquiry.[10] Operation Grange was scaled back in 2015, but the remaining detectives continued to pursue a small number of inquiries described in April 2017 as significant.[11]  The disappearance attracted sustained international interest and saturation coverage in the UK reminiscent of the death of Diana in 1997.[12] The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter's death,[a] particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter.[16][17] In 2008 they and their travelling companions received damages and apologies from Express Newspapers,[18] and in 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.[19][20]  People  Madeleine McCann  Madeleine was born in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At her parents' request, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf.[21][22] Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye.[2][b] In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.[25][26]  Kate and Gerry McCann  Madeleine's parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics. Kate Marie McCann, née Healy (born 1968, Huyton, near Liverpool) attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee. She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice.[27]  Gerald Patrick McCann (born 1968 in Glasgow) attended Holyrood R.C. Secondary School before graduating from the University of Glasgow with a BSc in physiology/sports science in 1989. In 1992 he qualified in medicine and in 2002 obtained his MD, a research degree, also from Glasgow. Since 2005 he has been a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester.[28] The McCanns met in 1993 in Glasgow and were married in 1998. Madeleine was born in 2003 and the twins, a boy and girl, in 2005.[29]  Tapas Seven  The McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns' three.[30] The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the Tapas Seven.[31]  The group included Fiona and David Payne, both physicians, their two children, and Fiona's mother, Dianne Webster. The McCanns had known the Paynes for years; Kate had met Fiona in 2000 when they both worked in Leicester General Hospital's intensive care unit.[32] Accompanying them were two couples the Paynes had originally introduced to the McCanns: Jane Tanner, a marketing manager, and her partner, Russell O'Brien, a physician, who were on holiday with their two children; and Matthew Oldfield, another physician, who was with his wife, Rachael Oldfield, a lawyer and recruitment consultant, and their daughter. Gerry, Russell and Matthew had worked together over the years.[33][31]  The ""Tanner sighting""—Jane Tanner's report that she saw a man carry a child away from the resort 45 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing—became one of the most-discussed aspects of the case.[34]  5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, Praia da Luz  Waterside Village Ocean Club resort:  1: Tapas restaurant;  2: 5A's front door;  3: Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins leading from 5A to Ocean Club door;  4: Stairs leading to 5A's patio doors. 1: Tapas restaurant;2: 5A's front door;3: Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins leading from 5A to Ocean Club door;4: Stairs leading to 5A's patio doors.  The McCanns arrived on Saturday, 28 April 2007, for their seven-night spring break in Praia da Luz, a village with a population of 1,000, known as ""little Britain"" because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers.[35] They had booked through the British holiday company Mark Warner Ltd, and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool, one of several privately owned properties rented by the company.[36]  5A was a two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village, which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner's Ocean Club resort.[37] Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B, Jane Tanner and Russell O'Brien in 5D, and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor.[38]  The apartment block was not a gated complex. Located on the corner of Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides.[39] Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.[40][41]  The McCanns' children slept in a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street.[42] Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite side of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.[40]  Thursday, 3 May 2007  20:30: Tapas restaurant  Apartment 5A Side of 5A  showing steps from Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins to 5A's patio doors showing steps from Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins to 5A's patio doors Front (non-resort) side  on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva Madeleine's bed (left);  window faces Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva Pink-and-white Eeyore pyjamas,  Madeleine's clothing Madeleine's clothing  Thursday, 3 May, was the penultimate day of the family's holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: ""Why didn't you come when [her brother] and I cried last night?"" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top.[43]  The children spent the morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool.[40] Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister.[44] The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson.[40] The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.[45]  At 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool.[46] 5A lay about 55 metres (160 ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295 ft).[5] The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.[46]  The resort's staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool reception area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening for the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.[47]  The McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant.[46]  21:15: Tanner sighting  [48] Artist's impression of the man Jane Tanner saw, released October 2007; Scotland Yard believe it was this British tourist carrying his daughter.  The sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker,[49] but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.[50]  Tanner told the police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man carrying a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine's bedroom, heading east, away from the front of apartment 5A.[51] In the early days of the investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case's first arguido.[54]  The child in the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner described the man as white, dark-haired, 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May.[55] Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.[56][57]  The sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring.[48] In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche.[58] Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner's report. Operation Grange's lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were ""almost certain"" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.[48][59]  22:00: Smith sighting  The rejection of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child that night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland.[60] Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnap.[9][61]  The Smiths saw the man at around 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (460 m) from the McCanns' apartment, walking away from the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5 ft 7 in–5 ft 9 in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child.[62][63] E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.[64]  22:00: Reported missing  Madeleine's mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.[40][65]  Kate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this.[66] Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio doors at the back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming ""Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!""[67]  At around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort's reception desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol.[68] Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4's Dispatches that, from one end of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.[69]  Early response  Portuguese police  Two officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, five miles (8 km) away.[70] At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária, in nearby Portimão. Kate McCann said they arrived just after 1 am.[71] According to the Polícia Judiciária, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted.[72] Two patrol dogs were brought to the resort at 2 am and four search-and-rescue dogs at 8 am.[73] Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins.[35][74] Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão, became the inquiry's coordinator.[75]  It was widely acknowledged that mistakes were made during the so-called ""golden hours"" soon after the disappearance. Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches.[76][77] According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10 the next morning.[62] Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information.[78] It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert.[62]  Not everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them.[77] The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine's bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one ""stranger"" had been found, but around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the Polícia Judiciária.[79][50] According to Madeleine's mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children's bedroom, but left at 3 am without securing the apartment.[71] The Polícia Judiciária case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests.[36][80]  A similar situation arose outside the apartment. A crowd gathered by the front door of 5A, including next to the children's bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.[50]  British police  In the UK it was agreed that Madeleine's home force, Leicestershire police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry.[82] A strategic coordinating group, or ""gold"" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The Polícia Judiciária gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, information was collected in boxes. In addition the Polícia Judiciária had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for Anthony Summers' and Robbyn Swan's book Looking for Madeleine (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a ""colonial power"".[83]  Media and PR  Tribute in Madeleine's home town of Rothley , 17 May 2007  A Polícia Judiciária officer acknowledged in 2010 that the Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start, because of the ""media circus"".[84] Gerry McCann told Vanity Fair in 2008 that he had decided to ""market"" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public-relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive.[35] Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers. This was apparently unprecedented.[85]  The first was Sheree Dodd, a former Daily Mirror journalist, then Clarence Mitchell, director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information.[86] On 15 May the McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund, a limited company, to raise money; its website attracted 58 million hits in the first two days.[87] The PR team arranged regular events to give the reporters a news peg. There was a visit to Fátima, where three children had reported a Marian apparition in 1917, as well as to Holland, Germany, Morocco and Spain. On 30 May, accompanied by reporters, the couple flew to Rome—in Sir Philip Green's Learjet—to meet Pope Benedict XVI.[35] [c] The following month balloons were let off in 300 cities around the world.[90] From early June journalists began to voice concerns.[91] The ""sheer professionalism of it ... troubled journalists"", according to Matthew Parris.[92]  When the government withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major's private secretary.[93][86] In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor and offered to cover Clarence Mitchell's salary so that he could return. Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine's Fund.[3][94]  Placing Madeleine on the front page of a British newspaper would sell up to 30,000 extra copies.[35] She appeared on the cover of People magazine on 28 May 2007,[95] on the front page of several British tabloids every day for almost six months, and became one of Sky News's menu options: ""UK News"", ""Madeleine"", ""World News"".[35][96][97] Between May 2007 and July 2008, the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã published 384 articles about her.[98] By June 2008 over seven million posts and 3,700 videos were returned in a search for her name on YouTube.[99]  First Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008)  First arguido  Twelve days after the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first arguido.[100][101] Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked.[100] He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking a lot of questions about the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.[102][103]  Three members of the Tapas Seven—Fiona Payne, Russell O'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside apartment 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister and the other a businesswoman. This would not have been surprising considering how close Murat lived to 5A, but he and his mother said he had been at home all evening.[106][107] The McCann circle was clearly suspicious of Murat: one of the McCanns' supporters offered Richard Bilton, a BBC reporter, ""exclusive access to any new developments in the case"" if Bilton would report back what the press pack was saying about Murat.[108]  Beginning on 15 May, Murat's home was searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, and two of his associates questioned.[100][109] In March 2008, one of those associates had his car torched, with the word fala (""speak"") sprayed in red on the pavement.[110]  There was nothing to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived.[6] In April 2008 he received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each.[111] In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard.[112] In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others.[113] In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.[114]  Witness statements  In statements to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days leading up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.[48][115]  Several witnesses reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, four hundred yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time.[116] On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street.[117] Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On the day of the disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A.[117] At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.  An ""ugly"" blonde-haired man was seen on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete,[120] and again on 2 May across the road from 5A, apparently watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A's former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the Tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, ""ugly"" with spots.[120][121] On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns' apartment block, where a white van was parked.[121]  In the late afternoon of 3 May, the niece of the woman who lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands.[122] At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.[123]  McCanns as arguidos  Early suspicion  Praia da Luz, July 2009  The first indication that the media was turning against the McCanns was on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance.[124][125] On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled ""The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence"" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements, and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented.[126][127] The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak.[49][125][128]  This and later articles in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media. They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were ""swingers"", that the McCanns had been sedating their children, and that the group had formed a ""pact of silence"" regarding what had happened the night of the disappearance.[102] Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns' and Tapas Seven's statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies. According to Kate McCann, the statements were then typed up in Portuguese, and verbally translated back into English for the interviewees to sign.[65][102]  Among the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back.[129] (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.)[46] There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked.[129] Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.[50]  The Polícia Judiciária questioned why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had run to the tapas restaurant leaving the twins alone in 5A, when she could have used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A's rear balcony.[130]  Bedroom shutter Officer dusts children's bedroom shutter  without protective clothing.[50] without protective clothing. —The Daily Telegraph  Another issue was whether the exterior shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside.[132] Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.  The apparent discrepancies contributed to the view of the Polícia Judiciária that there had been no abduction.[133] Kate's shout of ""they've taken her"" was viewed with suspicion, as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story.[50] Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance.[4][135] In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC Panorama that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.[136]  Portugal sends a letter rogatory  Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz, where the McCanns attended Mass  On 28 June 2007 the McCanns suggested to the Polícia Judiciária that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a ""matter orientation system"", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites.[50] On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his ""BS detector to go off the scale"".[137] Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a ""static signal"" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.[138][50][139]  The officer in charge of the Polícia Judiciária inquiry, Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, interpreted Kate's support of Krugel as a ploy. By this point he believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance, and that Kate was using Krugel—she had also considered using psychics—to ""disclose the location of her daughter's body"" without compromising herself.[140]  With this in mind, the Polícia Judiciária sent a letter rogatory to the British police to ask for assistance in their search for Madeleine's body.[50][139] In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter.[141] His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel's ideas as ""highly unlikely"". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, with the exception of a search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat's property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven's apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.[142][141]  British sniffer dogs arrive  External image Eddie, the CSI dog, with Martin Grime — Ross Parry Agency  Keela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a ""passive alert"" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position. Eddie was a cadaver dog or enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD) who gave a ""bark alert"" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated or in water. He was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason.[143]  The dogs arrived in Praia da Luz on 31 July 2007, and were taken to apartment 5A, nearby wasteland, and the beach. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room of 5A, and Eddie gave an alert near the wardrobe in the main bedroom.[145] There were no alerts on the beach or wasteland. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about the death of a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes. A source close to the McCanns' lawyers told reporters that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, it could have been caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor.[150]  The police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance,[151] and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car by the driver's door.[145] The next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver's side inside the boot (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park.[154] Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.[155]  British DNA analysis  Hair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007.[156] At this point, according to the Sunday Times, the Polícia Judiciária ""abandoned the abduction theory"".[50] On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, Polícia Judiciária regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry.[157] When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, The Daily Telegraph identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns.[158] Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate's memory was faulty.[157]  The FSS used a technique known as low copy number (LCN) testing. Used when only a few cells are available, the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation.[159] On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police, the liaison officer between the British and Portuguese police. Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine's DNA components, and that the result was ""too complex for meaningful interpretation"":  A complex LCN [low copy number] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section ... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart. ... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item; there are 37 components in total. There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors; but there could be up to five contributors. In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation/inclusion. ... [W]e cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match.[d]  McCanns made arguidos  The Forensic Science Service email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave.[162] Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September,[163] and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A.[164] Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.[165]  The DNA evidence was a ""100 percent match"", journalists in Portugal were told.[166] British tabloid headlines included ""Brit Lab Bombshell: Car DNA is 100% Maddie's"" (The Sun, 11 September 2007) and ""Corpse in McCann Car"" (London Evening Standard, 16 October 2007), while the Daily Star reported that a ""clump of Maddie's hair"" had been found in the car.[167] Jerry Lawton, a Daily Star reporter, told the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police.[e]  Matt Baggott—who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of Leicestershire Police, the force that coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese were in charge of the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force's priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.[169][f]  McCanns return to the UK, Almeida report  Despite their arguido status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007.[173]  The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements.[174][84] On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias.[175] Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop.[176] The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.[177]  In the UK Control Risks, a British security company—paid by an anonymous donor to assist the McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives.[178] According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, three months after the disappearance, but they had not done so.[179] Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.[180]  On 28 September, according to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010, the American ambassador to Portugal, Al Hoffman, wrote of his British counterpart, Alexander Ellis: ""Without delving into the details of the case, Ellis admitted [during a meeting on 21 September] that the British police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents, and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working co-operatively.""[181][182]  Gonçalo Amaral's removal, later developments  On 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry's coordinator, was removed from his post and transferred from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns, ignoring that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.[75][183]  Amaral was himself an arguido in relation to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later he was charged with making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11 km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.[184]  Amaral was replaced by Paulo Rebelo, deputy national director of the Polícia Judiciária. The team of detectives was expanded and a case review began.[185] On 29 November 2007 four members of the inquiry, including Francisco Corte-Real, vice-president of Portugal's forensic crime service, were briefed at Leicestershire police headquarters by the Forensic Science Service.[186]  The Tapas Seven were interviewed by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008, with the Polícia Judiciária in attendance.[187] The Polícia Judiciária planned the following month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate.[188] The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, on the day the couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television.[189] The national director of the Polícia Judiciária, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects.[190] As of May 2008 Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.[191]  Inquiry closed (21 July 2008)  On 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance. Their arguido status was lifted and the case was closed. Monteiro said in a statement:  The case involving Madeleine McCann will be shelved following the decision by the two magistrates in charge that no evidence was found to implicate the arguidos. Hereby the condition of all three arguidos ceases ... and the bail measures imposed upon the same have expired. If they appeal against the decision it can be reopened. ... The inquiry may be reopened by decision of prosecuting council or by request of any of those involved if new, serious and relevant evidence emerges.[6][7]  On 4 August Portugal's Ministério Público released 17 case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings.[192][g] The files included a 58-page prosecutors' report, which concluded: ""No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances.""[194] In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages.[195] Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate McCann's diary, which had been taken by the Polícia Judiciária in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, Correio da Manhã, despite a Portuguese judge's ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed.[196] On 14 September 2008 a News International tabloid, News of the World, published the extracts, again without permission and now translated poorly back into English.[197][198]  Amaral's book (24 July 2008)  The bad feeling between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, who had coordinated the investigation from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that, to cover it up, the McCanns had faked an abduction.[199] Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police were pursuing leads helpful only to the McCanns.[75] Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira (""Maddie: The Truth of the Lie""), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz.[200][201] By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies[202] and by 2010 had been translated into six languages.[84] A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.[203]  The McCanns began a libel action against Amaral and his publisher in 2009.[204] Madeleine's Fund covered the legal fees.[205][206] In 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages; Amaral's appeal against that decision succeeded in 2016.[204] A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or sales of the book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral's freedom of expression.[207] The ban was reinstated in 2015 as part of the libel ruling, then lifted when Amaral's appeal succeeded in 2016.[208][204] The McCanns appealed the 2016 decision to Portugal's Supreme Court, but the court ruled against them in February 2017. In their 76-page ruling, the judges wrote that the McCanns had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008.[7][209] In March 2017 the Supreme Court rejected the McCanns' final appeal.[205]  Madeleine's Fund  Raising money  The McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, 12 days after the disappearance.[211] Over 80 million people visited the fund's Find Madeleine website in the three months after the disappearance.[35] From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy's lawyer joined the fund's board of directors.[212][213][214]  Appeals were made by public figures and screened at football matches across Britain. Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise.[215][216][h] Donations included £250,000 from the News of the World, £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney.[217] J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns.[218] The fund did not cover the couple's legal costs arising from their status as arguidos,[219] but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns' mortgage payments, before they were made arguidos.[220]  A reward of £2.5 million was also offered, including from the News of the World, Rowling, Branson, Green, and a Scottish businessman, Stephen Winyard.[221][12] In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 in the form of libel damages arising out of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively.[222][223] In 2011 Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, was serialized by The Sun and The Sunday Times, both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million.[224][225] In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000.[226] As of February 2017 it had seven directors, including the McCanns.[227]  Private investigators  Madeleine's Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with the Portuguese police. Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks.[228] Brian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. Kennedy went to Morocco himself in 2007 to look into one sighting.[229][230][213]  One of the private investigators was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired on the recommendation of the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad.[231] Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter.[232] Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008,[233] and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.[234]  Oakley International  In 2008 Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months.[230][235][236][237] (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation.[238]) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community.[230]  Exton questioned the significance of the Tanner sighting of a man carrying a child at 21:15 near apartment 5A, and focused instead on the Smith sighting at 22:00—the sighting by Martin and Mary Smith of a man carrying a child near the McCanns' apartment that night. The Oakley team produced e-fits based on the Smiths' description. This was a sensitive issue, because in September 2007 Martin Smith had watched footage of the McCanns arriving in the UK from Portugal, and believed he recognized Gerry McCann as the man he had seen with the child in Praia da Luz. Smith came to accept that he was mistaken: at 22:00 witnesses placed Gerry McCann in the tapas restaurant. Nevertheless, publication of the Smith e-fits, which bore some resemblance to Gerry, would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns.[61]  Exton submitted his report to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton that the report and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between the company and the fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors.[61] The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011[239]—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.[61]  Scotland Yard released the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction. After it had aired, The Sunday Times published that the McCanns had had the e-fits since 2008.[61] In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (wrongly) that they had not only failed to publish them but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.[239][240]  Further police inquiries (2011–present)  Gamble report  The McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case.[241] Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble, then head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP).[158][242] By March 2010 the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a British inquiry.[158][243]  Delivered in May 2010, the Gamble report examined how several British agencies had become involved in the search for Madeleine, including CEOP itself, Leicestershire police, the Metropolitan Police Service, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the National Police Improvement Agency, Crimestoppers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street.[242]  Gamble criticized the lack of coordination. Everyone had wanted to help, and some had wanted ""to be seen to help"", he wrote, which had ""created a sense of chaos and a sense of competition"", hampering the inquiry by causing resentment among the Portuguese police.[242] He recommended renewed cooperation between the British and Portuguese, that all relevant information be exchanged between the police forces, that police perform an analysis of telephone calls made on the night of the disappearance, and that all leads be pursued, including those developed by private detectives.[244]  Operation Grange  In May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians.[245]  The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, The Sun.[224] On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, The Sun's front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper's petition that day.[246] On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of The Sun.[243] The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry.[247] Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.[248]  Operation Grange was led by Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell.[245] The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff.[249] When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall.[250] By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.[251]  The team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an age-progressed image,[252] and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four.[253] In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved additional funding of £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry;[254] another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year;[255] and £150,000 in November 2018 to cover until 31 March 2019, taking the cost of the inquiry to £11.75 million.[256]  Theories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off  DCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a ""criminal act by a stranger"", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed.[8] There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows.[115][48]  In an interview in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the ""burglary gone wrong"" hypothesis, while adding that it is ""not entirely ruled out"". Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had ""pretty much closed off that group of people"". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of remaining inquiries that they believe are significant: ""If we didn't think they were significant, we wouldn't be carrying on.""[11][257] Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard is looking for a woman who was seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance.[258]  Redwood said in 2013 that the disappearance ""on one reading of the evidence"", did look like a pre-planned abduction: ""That undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance.""[115][48] Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself.[115] In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British expats.[259] In October that year Scotland Yard and the BBC's Crimewatch staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting.[260] Days after Crimewatch aired, Portugal's attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.[10]  Another theory is that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the apartment by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one of the open construction sites nearby.[261] This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.[262]  Tracking mobile phone calls  Using mobile-phone tracking techniques, police were able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of the disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries.[263] The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.[113][264]  Police also found that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.[265]  Holiday-home sexual assaults  Scotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010.[266] The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.[267]  Searches and interviews in Praia da Luz  In June 2014 Scotland Yard and the Polícia Judiciária, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz. Nothing was found.[268] The following month, at Scotland Yard's request, the Polícia Judiciária in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance. No evidence was found to implicate them.[257] One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance.[112][269] Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the Polícia Judiciária, told the BBC in 2017 that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard requested them: ""We never saw or looked at those people as suspects of the crime.""[270]  Eleven people, including three British, were interviewed in December. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions, including ""Did you kill Madeleine?"" and ""Where did you hide the body?""[271] Robert Murat, his wife and her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. The bus driver and associates had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance.[264] They admitted having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine.[113][272]  Other inquiries  In the early days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz.[273] Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year.[274] Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.[275]  A man from Northern Ireland who died in 2013 was discussed in the media in connection with the disappearance; after being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing.[276] Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.[277] In June 2016 Operation Grange officers interviewed a victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse.[278] Freud had had a home in Praia da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance.[279] His family said he was in the UK when Madeleine went missing.[280]  Tabloids and social media  ""Trial by media""  Eilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance ""could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse"".[16] Twitter, one year old when Madeleine went missing, was the source of much of the vitriol against the McCanns.[281] Allegations were spread by YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook posts, discussion boards, blogs and personal websites, as well as across traditional media.[282] Ten years after the disappearance, the McCann hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield.[283] Social media's attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns' twins, and when Scotland Yard and Crimewatch staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal.[284] One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations, and the following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets.[285]  The couple's status as photogenic, articulate and professional was at first beneficial and protective. A white, middle-class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down.[287] The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the ""monstering of the McCanns"".[288] They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone, in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges.[289] Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.[290]  Kate McCann's appearance and demeanour were widely discussed, with much of the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books.[291] Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã cited sources complaining that she had not ""shed a single tear"".[293] Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public.[295] There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: ""How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?""  In November 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards.[20] The inquiry heard that the editor of the Daily Express, in particular, had become ""obsessed"" with the couple.[297] Express headlines included that Madeleine had been ""killed by sleeping pills"", ""Find body or McCanns will escape"", and ""'McCanns or a friend must be to blame'"", the latter based on an interview with a waiter.[298] ""Maddie 'Sold' By Hard-Up McCanns"" ran a headline in the Daily Star, part of the Express group.[299] Lord Justice Leveson called the articles ""complete piffle"".[297] Roy Greenslade described them as ""no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family"".[286]  Libel actions  In addition to the McCanns' legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers. The Daily Express, Daily Star and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine's Fund.[18] The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine's Fund, along with an apology in the Daily Express.[223] The McCanns received £55,000 from The Sunday Times in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police.[240]  Robert Murat received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in relation to 100 articles published by 11 newspapers—The Sun and News of the World (News International), Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star (Northern & Shell), Daily Mail, London Evening Standard and Metro (Associated Newspapers), Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Daily Record (Mirror Group Newspapers).[300] According to The Observer, it was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue.[111] His two associates were each awarded $100,000, and all three received public apologies.[300] The British Sky Broadcasting Group, which owns Sky News, paid Murat undisclosed damages in 2008 and agreed that Sky News would host an apology on its website for 12 months.[301]  See also  Sources  Notes  ^ Panorama, 3 May 2017): ""Even on the first glance of what we looked at, and when we took the information back and ran it through our own understanding and, you know, verified sightings and accounts and statements, and all the rest of it, it was perfectly clear to us that the McCanns themselves had nothing at all to do with the actual disappearance.""[13] Simon Foy, former head of homicide, Scotland Yard (BBC, 3 May 2017): ""Even on the first glance of what we looked at, and when we took the information back and ran it through our own understanding and, you know, verified sightings and accounts and statements, and all the rest of it, it was perfectly clear to us that the McCanns themselves had nothing at all to do with the actual disappearance.""

"It looks like Miranda Lambert and Gwen Stefani's feud over Blake Shelton is far from over!

MORE: Miranda Lambert Announces Her Engagement!  “Gwen thinks Miranda really needs to focus on her current relationship and not her ex. Gwen gets that Miranda’s split with Blake was heartbreaking but come on, it’s time to move on,” a source told Hollywood Life. “Gwen struggled to get over Gavin [Rossdale] but she did it and now it’s all about her relationship with Blake.

""I just want to say thank you for letting me release my heartbreak and sharing it with me,"" she said.  The couple announced back in July 2015 that they finalized their divorce after four years of marriage, which was right around when Gwen filed to end her marriage from the Bush front man.

Bella Hadid should win the award for being the most daring personality this year. The model looked practically naked in a head-to-toe crochet set, paired with Dior sneakers.  This wouldnt be the first time a celebrity has pulled a look like this, remember when Kendall Jenner showed up to the airport in see-through pants? so it’s safe to say it won’t be the last.  Apart from this style choice being one of the most statements of 2017, it’s incredibly form-fitting.  But the question remains, would you rock this?	0
"Ever since Donald Trump, a former reality television star, was elected the President of the United States, we’ve regularly wondered if other celebrities are going to run for the same position in the 2020 election. In the last few months, we’ve heard rumors that Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Duane “The Rock” Johnson, and Katy Perry are going to run — and that’s just naming a few. There’s also George Clooney, whose recent donation has some people wondering: George Clooney for president?  The topic was first broached back in the beginning of September 2017, when Clooney was doing press for his movie Suburbicon. A reporter asked if he’d like to run for president one day, and Clooney said,  ""Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I'd like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.""  Nothing but respect for my President and George Clooney. https://t.co/x0aCjAI2RW — J. (@JojoCule) February 20, 2018  Now, Clooney’s latest actions have fans wondering if he might actually run for office. Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pledged $500,000 to help fund the U.S. student-run march on Washington. Called the “March for Our Lives,” it’s taking place on March 24th, along with sister rallies across the country. The march is a response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took the lives of 17 people, and it’s a way for the students who survived to take some serious action to demand gun control reform.  George Clooney will March For Our Lives ... pic.twitter.com/HlA8U2K4xW — Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) February 20, 2018  Shortly after the Clooneys made their donation, rumors hit the news circuit.  Fox News host and Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity expressed his support, saying, “My attitude is, ‘Run, George, run.’ If George Clooney wants to run, I’m all for it. I think Oprah Winfrey would be infinitely better as a candidate than George Clooney.”  Hannity’s comments are sarcastic. What he’s trying to say is that he doesn’t think Clooney has a chance at winning, which is why he would want him to run — so that Trump could win again.  George Clooney for President. I'm not a fan in general, but he does more for this country then all the Trumps and their administration put together. — U.S. Blues 🌊🌊🌊 (@starshine731) February 20, 2018  Is there a chance Clooney might actually make a move?  Most likely not. His original comment about running was a joke, and when fans ran with it, Clooney cleared up any confusion in an interview with Variety, during which he said he doesn’t think celebrities should hold the position. He stated,  "" I think that having a celebrity as president who has a star on Hollywood Boulevard will exorcise our need to have someone famous in office. And maybe we’ll find someone who knows how to make policy.""  So, we probably won’t be calling him President George Clooney any time soon. But hey, one can dream, right?"	1
"This is the transcript of the debate between Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on February 21, 2008 at the University of Texas in Austin.Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton face off in a high-stakes debate, Thursday night. more photos »CNN's CAMPBELL BROWN: And the candidates have taken their seats. We are ready to get started. On behalf of CNN, Univision and the candidates, we want to thank our hosts, the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library.And now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.And we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. The order was determined by a draw. Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second.So please go ahead, Senator Clinton.SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.And I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.And I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.CLINTON: And among the people whom I got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were Barbara Jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...(APPLAUSE)...would actually be her birthday. I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.And another was my great friend Ann Richards, who taught me so much...(APPLAUSE)... about determination. Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas. She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.And as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere.CLINTON: You know, 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.(APPLAUSE)And 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen.So there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do.I want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people.And we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.(APPLAUSE)And I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans.CLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.And there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.(APPLAUSE)And I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign. It's now up to the people of Texas, Ohio, and the other states ahead.So, if you'll be part of this campaign, which is your really your campaign, about your futures, your families, your jobs and your health care, we'll continue to make a difference for America.Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Clinton, thank you.BROWN: Senator Obama?(APPLAUSE)SEN. BARACK OBAMA: First of all, thank you so much to the University of Texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with Senator Clinton. I've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is at war, and our economy is increasingly in shambles. And the families of Texas and all across America are feeling the brunt of that failing economy.This week, I met a couple in San Antonio, who -- as a consequence of entering into a predatory loan -- are on the brink of foreclosure and are actually seeing them having to cut back on their medical expenses, because their mortgage doubled in two weeks.OBAMA: I've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she's going to school full time, and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who's ill.In Youngstown, Ohio, talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad trade deals like NAFTA, literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China, resulting in devastating job losses and communities completely falling apart.And all across America I'm meeting not just veterans, but also the parents of those who have fallen.One mother in Green Bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that I believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the United States in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.OBAMA: Now, Senator Clinton...(APPLAUSE)... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. Some of them are the same. Some we have differences of opinion.But I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.But understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas.OBAMA: The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. They go to die because the lobbyists...(APPLAUSE)They go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in Washington. They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done.And so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together, that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in Washington, that we can be straight with the American people about how we're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government.You know, Senator Clinton mentioned Barbara Jordan, somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country. And she said that what the American people want is very simple: They want an America that is as good as its promise.OBAMA: I'm running for president because I want to help America be as good as its promise.Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right, Senator Obama, thank you, and let's begin with questions.Jorge Ramos?UNIVISION's JORGE RAMOS: Thank you very much (SPEAKING IN SPANISH).Thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. After nearly half a century in office, Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government. Ninety miles off the coast of the United States, we might have a new opportunity.The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?CLINTON: Well, Jorge, I hope we have an opportunity. The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy. And this gives the Cuban government, under Raul Castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.I'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.Of course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.I want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that.CLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.But there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.RAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?CLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.But we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people.BROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba.OBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century.I would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time.But I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba.And I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about.BROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.BROWN: So you've backtracked now...OBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba.So I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.And then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?CLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years.Because I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran.But there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others.CLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.And therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.So I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to...(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.But I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.Because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.OBAMA: That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: A question now on the economy.John King?CNN's JOHN KING: Campbell, Senators, good evening, first.I want to bring the conversation back home. You know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.For some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama.But when we ask Democrats, ""How are these two candidates different?,"" they even think they don't know.Senator Obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation's economy?OBAMA: Well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: You don't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.Everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.And so people have been struggling for a long time. In some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. So this has to be a priority of the next president.Now, what I've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.Number one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)We have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy...(APPLAUSE)... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.OBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security.We pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.(APPLAUSE)On our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them.(APPLAUSE)So these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.OBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So...(APPLAUSE)Now, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.Senator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.I think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.The question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?And it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.And I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about.OBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.KING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then.(APPLAUSE)As you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, ""I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.""The clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.What would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?CLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda.CLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.We're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.We're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.You know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day.(APPLAUSE)We will also have a different approach toward trade.We're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.We're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.Everywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.So I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.Clean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future.We also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work.And, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover...CLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much.BROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration.And, Jorge, you have a question.RAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.Would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?CLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.But when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That is against American values. And it is...(APPLAUSE)And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.I'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.And I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.Finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English.If they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?OBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively.Two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.Oftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform...(APPLAUSE)... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.OBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed.We have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.We have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.Number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.(APPLAUSE)And what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that.OBAMA: So we've got to fix that.The second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.And the problem that we have...(APPLAUSE)The problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right, Senator Obama.We're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question.Go ahead, John.KING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence.KING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.But, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.Senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow.As president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, ""You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?""CLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate.CLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.(APPLAUSE)And what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.This is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.So what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.I think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive.CLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...(APPLAUSE)... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?KING: Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?Because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the San Diego area, it only went so far. And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. And California's problem became Arizona's problem.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: But, you know, John, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. You know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.CLINTON: It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.I think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.So what I have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. But let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.I frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.BROWN: All right.CLINTON: And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton.(APPLAUSE)Senator Obama, go ahead please.OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree. I think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.And the Bush administration is not real good at listening. That's not what they do well.(LAUGHTER)And so I will reverse that policy. As Senator Clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. But for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.The one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice. I think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...(APPLAUSE)... to sending people back.But what they do also want is some order to the process. And so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. We're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.And that's why I think comprehensive reform is so important. That's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that I'll show in the future.One last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.OBAMA: I do not want two classes of citizens in this country.(APPLAUSE)I want everybody to prosper. That's going to be a top priority.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: OK, we've got one last question on immigration.Jorge, go ahead.RAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish.(APPLAUSE)Many of them are right here. By the year 2050, there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States. Now, is there any downside, Senator Clinton, to the United States becoming (SPEAKING SPANISH) becoming a bilingual nation? Is there a limit?CLINTON: Well, I think it's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.I think it is important, though, that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream.You know, I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language. That I do not believe is appropriate, and I have voted against it and spoken against it.CLINTON: I represent New York. We have 170 languages in New York City alone. And I do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak English, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.But I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience. So I encourage people to become bilingual. But I also want to see English remain the common, unifying language of our country.(APPLAUSE)RAMOS: Senator Obama, is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation?OBAMA: Well, I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. I think that's very important.I also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...(APPLAUSE)... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.OBAMA: If bilingual education helps them do that, I want to give them the opportunity.But I also want to make sure that English-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.One of the failures of No Child Left Behind, a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.(APPLAUSE)And foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected. I want to put more resources into it.BROWN: All right.We're going to take a quick break. We've got to go to a commercial. We'll be back with a lot more. There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. Go to our Web site, CNNpolitics.com, and join in. The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BROWN: And we are back. We're here in Austin, Texas, the capital city. Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas, Austin.The first question now goes to John King.KING: Senator, as I'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and I'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments.I've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)And so, I want to ask you about that. There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.And, Senator Clinton, I want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days.You've said, quote, ""My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions.""You said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is, quote, ""talk versus action.""Now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the ""Where's the beef?"" question.But, since we're in Texas, I'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of President Bush. Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?CLINTON: Well, I have said that about President Bush, and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.(APPLAUSE)You know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil.CLINTON: But there are differences between us. And I think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.And I do offer solutions. That's what I believe in and what I have done. And it's what I offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. Because I think that this country has given me so much.And there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. I have to confess, I was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the TV shows, one of Senator Obama's supporters couldn't.So I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. And it's important that voters get that information. So, yes, I do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. And I offer...(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead.BROWN: Senator Obama, do you want to respond?OBAMA: Well, I think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...(APPLAUSE)... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.You know, I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who, prior to me getting to the Senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, I think they've said that I've engaged not just in talk, but in action.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Now, I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I don't want to denigrate that record. I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. Senator Clinton of late has said: Let's get real. The implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.(LAUGHTER)And that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: You know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.Well, I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly. What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done. And the reason that this campaign has done so well...(APPLAUSE)The reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions. But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.I'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.OBAMA: Right.BROWN: How do you respond?OBAMA: Well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. There are two lines in speeches that I've been giving over the last couple of weeks.I've been campaigning now for the last two years. Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that I share, that words are important. Words matter. And the implication that they don't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise. Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody.OBAMA: And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...(APPLAUSE)... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think, is silly, and...(APPLAUSE)... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and I think people start getting discouraged about it...(LAUGHTER)... and they don't want...(APPLAUSE)What they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?How are we going to provide health care to the American people?How are we going to make sure that college is affordable?So what I've been talking about, in this speeches -- and I've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.(APPLAUSE)What I've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. It's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...(APPLAUSE)... so that college becomes more affordable.OBAMA: I've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States.(APPLAUSE)So just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which I have been working on for years now. Senator Clinton has a fine record. So do I. I'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Clinton, is it the silly season?CLINTON: Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That's, I think, a very simple proposition.(APPLAUSE)And, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can Xerox. And I just don't think...OBAMA: Come on.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: No, but, you know, but, Barack, it is.Because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos, it does raise questions.Now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and I applaud you for that. But when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.CLINTON: It is not enough to say, ""Let's come together."" We know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.You know, when I proposed a universal health care plan, as did Senator Edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.And you chose not to do that. You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. That's a big difference.When I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.And, you know, in the last week, even President Bush has said we have to do something like that.I just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after George Bush leaves the White House.CLINTON: The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. We all know that.(APPLAUSE)But then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. You know, when I took on...(APPLAUSE)When I took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. I was more than happy to do that, because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American.I don't want to leave anybody out. I see the results of leaving people out. I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton, thank you.Senator Obama, please respond.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Well, I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. I'm happy to debate those, which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign. We both want universal health care.When I released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care. Of course, I was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. It's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. The politics have changed a little bit.We both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress. And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.OBAMA: We're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. And I want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.Now, I also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.So we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. We've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.And my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.And so I emphasize reducing costs.(APPLAUSE)And as has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.OBAMA: Now, there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate, and I'm happy to have that debate.But the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans, and that is simply not true. We think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.One last point I want to make on the health care front. I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. She deserves credit for that.(APPLAUSE)But I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward.And, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate.OBAMA: And I've said that I'm going to do things differently. I think we have to open up the process. Everybody has to have a seat at the table. And most importantly, the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.The point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in Washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. Stay with us. We've got a lot more ahead.You can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our Web site, Cnnpolitics.com. A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BROWN: An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas.Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate. Let's get right to it. Jorge Ramos with the next question.RAMOS: Senator Clinton, yesterday you said, and I'm quoting, ""One of us is ready to be commander in chief.""Are you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?CLINTON: Well, I believe that I am ready and I am prepared. And I will leave that to the voters to decide.But I want to get back to health care, because I didn't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished. No, let me finish, Jorge...RAMOS: But I would like to come back...CLINTON: This is a significant difference. You know, Senator Obama has said it's a philosophical difference. I think it's a substantive difference.He has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. I agree with that. I just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.(APPLAUSE)And you know, in one of our earlier debates, John Edwards made a great point. It would be as though Social Security were voluntary. Medicare, one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson, was voluntary.(APPLAUSE)I do not believe that is going to work. So it's not just a philosophical difference.CLINTON: You look at what will work and what will not work. If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right. We appreciate that you want to make a point, Senator Obama. We have limited time, so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: Well, I understand. But I think that Senator Clinton made a...(LAUGHTER)You know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make...BROWN: Very briefly, absolutely.OBAMA: Number one, understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. And Senator Clinton is right; we have to find out what works.OBAMA: Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it.In some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. They don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine.(APPLAUSE)In order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and Senator Clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. Now, this is a substantive difference. But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there.BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton?CLINTON: Wait a minute, no, this is too important. This is the number one issue that people talk to me about. You know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, ""I can't get the operation my son needs because I don't have health insurance,"" it is personal for me.CLINTON: And I just fundamentally disagree.You know, Senator Obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...OBAMA: That's right.CLINTON: ... insure their children.OBAMA: That's right.CLINTON: Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.OBAMA: There's a reason.CLINTON: He's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.We would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate. I want a universal health care plan.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. Point number one.Point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.OBAMA: There are no excuses. If a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. And those children don't have a choice. But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.And it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.But the notion that, somehow, I am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.BROWN: All right. Jorge...CLINTON: We disagree on that.BROWN: OK. Jorge -- let's let Jorge re-ask his question, because I don't think anyone remembers that one.(LAUGHTER)RAMOS: Let me try again, and not in Spanish, OK?(LAUGHTER)Here we go again. Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important.And here's the question. Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? That's a question of: What did you mean by that phrase?CLINTON: What I mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, I've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. I've served on the Senate...(APPLAUSE)I've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face.You know, just this week, it's a good example. We had elections in Pakistan, we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership. We've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba. We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia.So we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. You know, we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba, I hope with President Musharraf, for him to do the right thing.CLINTON: I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. Under international law, they should be doing that.So when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush. And that is what I am putting forth to the voters.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Obama?OBAMA: I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I was prepared to be commander-in-chief.(APPLAUSE)My number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe. I will do whatever is required to accomplish that. I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm.Now, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when I am president.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.(APPLAUSE)Now, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda, that killed 3,000 Americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001.You know, I've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon. Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq.OBAMA: And as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. They were actually capturing Taliban weapons, because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.Now, that's a consequence of bad judgment. And you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? And I think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally, I didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.I said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. And I was right.On the question of Pakistan, which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. But I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. And I was right about that.On the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.OBAMA: On the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right. We're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq.John King?KING: I want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. Because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.And you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.You both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the United States Senate, about whether to support the surge. And as that was going on, Senator Clinton, you had the commanding general in Iraq before you. And you said, ""I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief"" -- your words to General Petraeus.KING: I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better. Ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation.Is Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?CLINTON: Well, John, I think you forget a very important premise of the surge. The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.Now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.CLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.That is why I have said, upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.And I would begin that with...(APPLAUSE)... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by President Bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.CLINTON: I believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.Last night in Brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, ""Please, my husband's there for the third time. Bring him home.""And I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there. It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?OBAMA: Well, I think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in Iraq. And that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.In fact, you know, the 1st Cavalry, out of Fort Hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: And, you know, we honor their service.But this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.(LAUGHTER)And I think that, when we're having a debate with John McCain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision...(APPLAUSE)... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.(LAUGHTER)Because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. Understand, not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan. We've been diverted from focusing on Latin America.We contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week.OBAMA: And it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.Iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq, and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with.So that is a debate that I'm happy to have.One last point I want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...(APPLAUSE)... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.OBAMA: That's unacceptable. But we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for.And that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. As John McCain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. It is clear from his embrace of George Bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right. We've got to take another quick break. We've got a lot more ahead. Stay with us. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BROWN: Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate.Stay with us after the debate. Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.But back to the debate.John King?KING: Thank you.Both of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.Tonight, Senator Obama, you've talked about more transparency. You also at one point criticized earmarks.And yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.And you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. Why?OBAMA: No, that's not true. We've actually disclosed, John, all our earmarks. And so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because I believe very strongly in transparency.OBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. And if they see a no-bid contract going to Halliburton, they can check that out, too.And you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the American people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. And I've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.OBAMA: Now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, ""this is the kind of spending that I think is important.""I have consistently supported those efforts. I will push for those as president of the United States of America.KING: Senator Clinton, as you know, I think your number was about $342 million. You say they're worthy projects, as Senator Obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.Senator McCain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.On the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think, whether it is the House or the Senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the American people that, ""I have done this my entire career; I will do it as president,"" on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?CLINTON: Well, no, not at all. Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war, with the billions of dollars...(APPLAUSE)... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.You know, when President Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. And it is gone. And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new Bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America.(APPLAUSE)I will get us back to fiscal responsibility. And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.CLINTON: Middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: Those will be my priorities.And I think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.So the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on. It was working well. It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.I've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he's been a part of.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right.An issue relating to the current election.Jorge?RAMOS: As we can see, this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in government, said recently, and I'm quoting, ""It would be a problem"" -- and this is a question for you, Senator Clinton -- ""it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided.""Do you agree?CLINTON: Well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, I think that it will sort itself out. I'm not worried about that. We will have a nominee, and we will have a unified Democratic Party, and we will go on to victory in November.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead. Do you have a response to Senator Clinton?OBAMA: Well, I think it is important, given how hard Senator Clinton and I have been working, that these primaries and caucuses count for something. And so my belief is that...(APPLAUSE)... the will of the voters, expressed in this long election process, is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be.OBAMA: But understand what I think is most important to the voters, and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again. They feel as if they've been shut out.You know, when I meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids, it's not just the desperation of that single mom. It's also that when they try to find some help, oftentimes they're hitting a brick wall.And they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in Washington right now relate to them at all. And what they believe is that people are trying to get on TV and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the American people and their dreams.And I have no doubt that the Democratic Party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the American people.OBAMA: And I think that the next nominee going into the November election is going to have a lot to talk about because the American people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. They want their government back, and that's what I intend to provide them when I'm nominated for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: We have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. You've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.A leader's judgment is most tested at times of crisis. I'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis.BROWN: Senator Obama?OBAMA: Well, you know, I wouldn't point to a single moment. But what I look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, I was raised by a single mom. My father left when I was two, and I was raised by my mother and my grandparents.And, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when I made mistakes and was off course. And what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how I can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.And so, working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didn't have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on Wall Street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, I think, is the judgment that I now bring.OBAMA: It's the reason that I have the capacity to bring people together, and it's the reason why I am determined to make sure that the American people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: Senator Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think everybody here knows I've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life. And...(APPLAUSE)And I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans.But people often ask me, ""How do you do it?"" You know, ""How do you keep going?"" And I just have to shake my head in wonderment, because with all of the challenges that I've had, they are nothing compared to what I see happening in the lives of Americans every single day. along with Senator McCain, as the only two elected officials, to speak at the opening at the Intrepid Center at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio, a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war.And I remember sitting up there and watching them come in. Those who could walk were walking. Those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others. Some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys. And the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb.CLINTON: You know, the hits I've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.And I resolved at a very young age that I'd been blessed and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted.That's what gets me up in the morning. That's what motivates me in this campaign.(APPLAUSE)And, you know, no matter what happens in this contest -- and I am honored, I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Whatever happens, we're going to be fine. You know, we have strong support from our families and our friends. I just hope that we'll be able to say the same thing about the American people, and that's what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)BROWN: All right, a standing ovation here in Austin, Texas. Our thanks to Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. We appreciate your time tonight.(APPLAUSE)And to John and Jorge as well.We also want to thank our debate partners, the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Democratic Party, the LBJ Library as well, and the city of Austin.END E-mail to a friend"	0
Olivia Anderson – World Stars Mag  Meghan Markle looked sunny and chic on Thursday when she attended a reception for the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge in London with Prince Harry.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a bright yellow sleeveless dress by American designer Brandon Maxwell, which could be considered a timely choice given the recent U.S. holiday.  The royal accessorized her look with earrings and nude heels. She also tucked her hair into a neat little bun.  The ensemble is a stark contrast to the more muted tones Meghan has been wearing since becoming a royal. However, Meghan’s wardrobe choices are likely intentional. After all, the duchess has attended many events with Queen Elizabeth II, and Dishaw suspected Meghan aligned her fashion choices for these events to not overshadow the importance of those events or the other members of her new family that were with her. As for the Duke of Sussex, Harry looked snazzy in a blue suit.  However, Meghan isn’t the first royal to wear the bright color. Kate Middleton has worn yellow to many occasions. Princess Diana also wore yellow to several events    Held at the Marlborough House, the event invited young leaders from across the Commonwealth to discuss how they hope to shape the future of their states by the year 2040. The leaders focus on a number of topics, including human rights, health climate change, peace and democracy.  Her Majesty appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador in April 2018, so the event was a significant one for the Duke of Sussex. He expressed his excitement during a speech at the event.	0

Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.  Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party  Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable?  photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty  May 2011: Billboard Music Awards  Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.  photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty  November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently  Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.  photography via instagram.com/ashilrd  January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber  They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it.  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards  The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split.  photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin    December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours  Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).  photography via instagram.com/zedd  January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin  Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.  photography via instagram.com/selenamylight  September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE  Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.  photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator  November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”.  photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin  January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve  Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — rip jelena 2010-2018 (@thorsodn) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber 💕 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  📱| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 3, 2016 at 4:12pm PST  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Now I know what Love is A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 16, 2018 at 7:45pm PST  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — Hennessy ✨ (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best.	1
Former Disney Channel star Orlando Brown was recently arrested following what authorities say was a violent altercation at an apartment in California.  >> Read more trending news  The 30-year-old “That’s So Raven” actor was reportedly engaged in a dispute with his girlfriend and his girlfriend’s mother when an officer from the Barstow Police Department arrived on the scene at around 8 a.m. Thursday.

"Taylor Swift's sexual assault trial against former radio DJ David Mueller will begin its third day in Denver today. Mueller is suing Swift because he was fired from his radio co-host job in 2013 after she claimed he lifted her skirt and grabbed her butt while they posed for a photo at a meet and greet during her Denver Red Tour concert. Swift filed a countersuit a month later for sexual assault and battery.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  According to Gossip Cop and the Associated Press, Mueller is seeking $3 million in damages from Swift, while Swift is seeking just $1 in her suit (in addition to reimbursement for attorneys fees and costs in defending the suit, according to pre-trial documents per The Denver Post). ""She's not trying to bankrupt this man,"" her attorney J. Doug Baldridge said in his opening statement yesterday (via Denver ABC 7's live case blog). ""She's just trying to tell people out there that you can say no when someone puts their hand on you. Grabbing a woman's rear end is an assault, and it's always wrong. Any woman—rich, poor, famous, or not—is entitled to have that not happen.""  Gossip Cop also reported that if Swift is awarded any additional damages, she said she will donate the money to a women's rights charity.  The Mueller v. Swift trial—which is before a judge and 8-member jury (6 women, 2 men selected)—is expected to last for nine days total. Swift is expected to testify."	1
Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million ($9,423,695) after a trial that ended with a Los Angeles jury finding in the producer’s favor in a royalties dispute with Michael Jackson’s estate, Variety reports.  The lawsuit, which Jones filed in 2013, stemmed from Jones’ claim that he was owed royalties for a series of projects that were released after Jackson died, including the music used in two Cirque du Soleil productions and music featured in the This Is It concert film. Jones said he was owed $30 million.  Last week, Jones took the witness stand and claimed he was “cheated out of a lot of money” by the Jackson estate.  During the two-week trial, lawyers debated over interpreting the contract language that determined how Jones’ royalties should be computed, particularly the contracts from Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. Attorneys for Jones argued that those contracts entitled Jones to royalties from the posthumous This is It along with proceeds from the two Cirque du Soleil shows. Meanwhile, Howard Weitzman, who represented the Jackson estate, argued that Jackson made the major contributions to the sound of each song.  “While the jury denied Quincy Jones $21 million – or more than two-thirds of what he demanded — from The Estate of Michael Jackson, we still believe that giving him millions of dollars that he has no right to receive under his contracts is wrong,” Weitzman and Zia Modabber, attorneys for The Estate of Michael Jackson, said in a statement. “This would reinterpret the legal language in, and effectively rewrite, contracts that Mr. Jones lived under for more than three decades, admitted he never read, referred to as ‘contract, montract,’ and told the jurors he didn’t ‘give a damn’ about. Any amount above and beyond what is called for in his contracts is too much and unfair to Michael’s heirs. Although Mr. Jones is portraying this is a victory for artists’ rights, the real artist is Michael Jackson and it is his money Mr. Jones is seeking.”  Following the verdict, Jones said in a statement via Variety, “As an artist, maintaining the vision and integrity of one’s creation is of paramount importance. I, along with the team I assembled with Michael, took great care and purpose in creating these albums, and it has always given me a great sense of pride and comfort that three decades after they were originally recorded, these songs are still being played in every corner of the world.  “This lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,” he continued. ” Although this judgement is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter. I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists’ rights overall.”	0

R&B singer R. Kelly is involved in yet another lawsuit in which he is accused of sexual assault.  The New York Times reported that Faith A. Rodgers, a 20-year-old Texas woman, filed a suit in a New York court. Rodgers said she was 19 when she started a relationship with Kelly.  >> Read more trending news  NYT reported that, according to the filing, Rodgers said she met Kelly in March 2017 after he performed in San Antonio, Texas. She said she was flown to New York by Kelly after months of phone contact. It was in New York that Rodgers alleges Kelly “initiated unwanted sexual contact” in a hotel room and did not tell Rodgers he was infected with herpes. The suit claims she contracted the disease.  “He turns on all the lights ...And he’s like, ‘Take off your clothes.’ And he says it, you know, with authority in his voice,” Rodgers told CBS News Tuesday. “Not just, you know, he’s demanding me to do this. And I didn’t take off my clothes because why would I? I just wasn’t ready… Sex isn’t something, you know, I’m ready for.”  Rodgers said she ultimately submitted and had sex with Kelly even though she didn’t want to. She claimed Kelly recorded the act on his iPad without her consent.  Rodgers said after the incident, Kelly asked how old she was.  “I told him and he’s like, ‘You know, if you’re really, you know, 16, that you can tell daddy, right?’ And he was like, ‘You know, you just look about 14, 15 or 16,’” she said.  Rodgers said in the suit that she was in a relationship with Kelly for a year, in which he “routinely engaged in intimidation, mental, verbal and sexual abuse, during and after sexual contact.” The suit alleges Kelly’s actions were “designed to humiliate, embarrass, intimate and shame her.”  The suit is seeking unspecified damages, alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment and failure to disclose a sexually transmitted disease. CBS News reported that Rodgers previously filed a criminal complaint with the Dallas Police Department in April.  In the past, Kelly has routinely denied allegations of sexual abuse. In response to the April criminal complaint, Kelly’s representative said the musician “categorically denies all claims and allegations.”	0
"A recruitment video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool.Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists.A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:Muhammad Ali on Donald Trump: ‘Muslims have to stand up’ to anti-Islamic speechWhy Donald Trump’s call for a Muslim ban may work for him, in two charts"	0
Johnny Depp surprised Disneyland park-goers Wednesday evening when he dressed up as Captain Jack Sparrow aboard the “Pirates of the Caribbean” ride.  Instead of the usual animatronic in Depp’s likeness, visitors were treated to the actual actor reciting lines from the popular film franchise while brandishing his sword at the Anaheim, California, theme park.  This is not the first time Depp has stopped by the ride that inspired 2003’s “Curse of the Black Pearl,” but this is his first appearance during the “Dead Men Tell No Tales” era of his iconic captain’s log.  Some lucky riders were able to capture footage of Depp getting into character on social media.  Life is complete! Just saw Johnny Depp on Pirates of the Caribbean @Disneyland !! #PiratesoftheCaribbean pic.twitter.com/33lLTGmHng — Patricia Marie (@MissLovelyCuppy) April 27, 2017  Depp even abandoned ship to entertain guests waiting in line on the facade of the attraction.  The stunt comes just a month before “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” sails into theaters May 26.  The fifth installment of Disney’s swashbuckling franchise will see a departure from 2011’s “On Stranger Tides” in an effort to return to the original film’s feel. Also returning will be Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who were last seen in 2007’s “At World’s End.”  “Tales” also stars Javier Bardem, Kaya Scodelario, Brenton Thwaites, Kevin McNally, and Geoffrey Rush.	0
The cancellation of the third Sex and the City film came with headline-making allegations and jabs shared in the press between stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall — something Parker says was “enormously painful” for her.  In an interview with The Daily Beast while promoting the second season of her HBO show Divorce, the 52-year-old Emmy-winner opened up about the pains of hearing things in the press that “aren’t true” — “especially when it is a personal attack about your character.”  “I’m stunned by how deeply it still cuts,” Parker said of the drama around the movie, which would have also starred Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. “What happened, that was enormously painful for me.”  Kim Cattrall, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis in Sex and the City 2. Craig Blankenhorn/Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection  Parker first revealed in September that SATC3 had been scrapped despite 8 years of encouragement from fans and having a “beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story” ready for filming.  Though sources told PEOPLE Cattrall made “outrageous demands” to re-board the big screen franchise, she later denied that her requests had anything to do with the scrapping of the film and claimed she had never agreed to board SATC3 in the first place — even refuting an offer to do it back in 2016.  “I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects. To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous,” the 61-year-old actress told Piers Morgan in October, saying Parker — who would have been a producer on the film — “could have been nicer.”  Cattrall then admitted that she had never been close with the other three co-stars. “We’ve never been friends,” Cattrall said. “We’ve been colleagues and in some way, it’s a very healthy place to be.”  Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker Bryan Bedder/Getty  As the story unfolded, Parker said she wanted to speak out about it in the press but was held back by coaches who told her to remain quiet.  “When all that stuff was happening with Sex and the City, which I know is meaningless in the world, but when it’s happening and you’re caught up in any of the muscle of that stuff, it’s so painful because all you want to do is respond. All you want to do is say, ‘Are you kidding me!? This is everything I know. This is everything that happened over the last six months. These are the conversations. These are the emails. These are the conversations with lawyers and agents and studio heads,'” she recalled to The Daily Beast. “But you’re counseled time and time again, “Don’t do it. You’re going to get in the weeds. It’s a nowhere road.”  “I just kept saying, ‘This was an experience I loved. I love those women. We shared this experience. It was a privilege. If that’s what we’re left with, those memories, there are only four of us who…’ You know?” she added.  Sarah Jessica Parker Neilson Barnard/NBCUniversal/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty  She’s been more vocal recently though, talking about the possibility of trying the project again on the Golden Globes red carpet and even jokingly offering Cattrall’s role to Stephen Colbert.  So what changed? Turns out the bevy of sexual misconduct allegations plaguing Hollywood allowed Parker to put the SATC3 allegations into perspective.  “The world shifted,” she said. “I was like, ‘Oh this is ridiculous.’ I was afraid to talk about these allegations, and now there are real allegations in the world. And all of a sudden I was like, ‘I think I’m going to answer the question about the Sex and the City movie.”  “For so long I was told to be quiet about all of that stuff. And all of a sudden I’m like, ‘If people are being encouraged to come forward and talk about really difficult, painful, potentially criminal things that they were part of or witnessed, I think I can talk about the Sex and the City 3 movie,'” she added, laughing. “I think it’s okay! I’m a grown freaking woman.”  Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kristin Davis Hector Vallenilla/Retna Ltd./Corbis  RELATED VIDEO: Kim Cattrall Slams Sarah Jessica Parker as Tensions Surrounding SATC 3 Revealed: ‘Kim Killed the Movie,’ Says Source  Though she’s open to discussing it now, Parker did understand that the conversation changes the way fans think about the legacy of the project.  “It hurts the franchise… it does,” she said. “It changes the way people experience the show. It changes my own experience to have to talk about it like that. It opens the conversation up time and again. You put the white-hot spotlight back on it again. But then you realize it’s just silliness. Of course I can answer honestly about my experience. Of course I can say what happened. It’s so silly.”	1

"Jimmy Kimmel loves to joke around, even if it gets him in trouble.  In an interview from his February 2018 GQ cover story posted earlier this week, the 50-year-old late night host opened up about the infamous 2013 Twitter feud with Kanye West.  “I live for moments like that. When I got in a Twitter battle with Kanye, I was so happy,"" Kimmel told the mag. ""My wife makes fun of me. She's like, ‘You are so happy right now.’ I'm absolutely beaming. I feel very confident in a situation like that.""  The online war began when Kimmel did a parody sketch on his show, making fun of the rapper's BBC interview in which he claimed he was the ""biggest"" rock star. West didn't appreciate the joke and exploded on Twitter, calling out Kimmel.  ""JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS,"" West tweeted at the time, followed by more NSFW comments.  The feud was eventually squashed when West made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! this past October. Then for Kimmel's 50th birthday, Kim Kardashian West read one of her husband's infamous tweets during the show's ""Mean Tweets"" segment.  “JIMMY KIMMEL PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES… OH NO THAT MEANS YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TOO MUCH GOOD P**Y IN YOUR LIFE,” she read aloud.  Meanwhile, Kimmel is gearing up to host the Oscars for a second year in a row. Hollywood has already been very vocal about the recent sexual harassment and misconduct allegations within the industry, and Kimmel is ready to tackle the subject during awards night.  “I'm surprisingly not nervous,” he said. “I think there are certain groups of people who think I shouldn't make any jokes about that situation. And there are groups of people who will be mad if I don't make jokes about that situation. So you just kind of have to figure it out. Whatever I do will be criticized by someone. Like, ‘You didn't make enough jokes about Harvey Weinstein.'""  For more on Kimmel, watch below.

"In a new cover story with Glamour UK, Kate Winslet talked about a lot of things: her new adventure thriller The Mountain Between Us, which also stars Idris Elba; what she would've done if she hadn't become an actress; and also, a little bit about her long-running friendship with Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, who has been in her life for two decades now.  Kate, who recently attended Leo's 4th annual gala and auction for his environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, said of their friendship:  ""You don’t even want to know the last conversation we had, because it was so funny and made me laugh so much. We found ourselves saying to each other, 'Can you imagine if the world really knew the stupid things we say?'""  It's not too hard to imagine the two A-list actors gabbing about their normal Hollywood lives, especially since they're the only two people who really know what it was like working and growing under the shadow of pop culture juggernaut Titanic. So it also totally makes sense that the two still joke about the film between themselves:  ""I’m not going to tell you what we actually talk about, but yeah, we’re very, very close and sometimes we do quote the odd Titanic line back and forth to each other, because only we can, and we find it really funny.""  #NoNewFriends, clearly. But if Kate and Leo ever want a third party to listen to their Titanic jokes, there are definitely quite a few people who'd happily step into that role.  Follow Lilian on Twitter."	0
“Grey’s Anatomy” stars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew are leaving the ABC drama, Variety has confirmed. The two actors will depart at the end of the show’s current and 14th season.  “The characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey’s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,” said executive producer Krista Vernof. “As writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.”  “It’s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.”  Capshaw and Drew’s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season. Rhimes last year signed an overall deal with Netflix worth $100 million, that takes her away from her longtime home at ABC Studios, which produces “Grey’s Anatomy.”  Deadline first reported the departures.	0

Cue the pink balloons! Aaron Paul and his wife, Lauren, have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl. According to her birth certificate, which was obtained by The Blast, the new parents named their daughter Story Annabelle.  “There are no words that will ever be able to explain what just happened to my heart,” the proud mom captioned an Instagram pic of their newborn on Thursday, February 8. The actor, meanwhile, shared a pic of their daughter’s foot while at the hospital. He gushed: “My heart.”  The Path actor, 38, opened up about his soon-to-be bundle of joy while appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, January 23. “[She’s due] any minute now,” he revealed. “I love babies, I’ve always loved babies.”  Paul and the Kind Campaign founder announced their pregnancy news in September 2017. “Hey everyone. Look what I did,” the Central Intelligence star captioned an Instagram photo of Lauren’s baby bump at the time. “Words can’t express how excited I am that this little one has entered our lives. Just thought it was time I would share this beautiful news with all of you.”  The couple revealed their baby-to-be’s gender the following month, and the Breaking Bad alum boasted about his brood while chatting with Us Weekly in December of that year. “I hang out in her nursery a lot, it’s almost done. It’s quickly turned into our favorite room of the house,” he gushed. “Everything’s very light and just warm, it feels like little nest.

We’ve known for a few weeks now that Disney is turning yet another of its classic animated features into a live-action film. Launching next May, Aladdin will join the likes of Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, and The Lion King. But Disney has so far only released a teaser trailer for the film, and until now we had no idea how Will Smith will look as the Genie. However, the first Aladdin footage and still photos are now out, and Smith’s Genie is finally out of the bottle.  Aladdin is one of those iconic Disney classics that deserves a modern take, and the upcoming movie has Guy Ritchie at the helm — which is an unexpected choice for this particular kind of movie. Aside from Smith’s Genie, we’ve got Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott playing the other two main characters, Aladdin and Princess Jasmine.  As with other Disney creations, it’s Entertainment Weekly out with the first look at the new live-action movie. The story offers a preview of what making an Aladdin movie means right now, featuring images from the set as well as the first footage that shows Smith in Genie attire. After all, it’s not like we care as much about Aladdin or Jasmine as we do about the Genie. And Smith will have a tough job ahead replacing the previous Genie, Robin Williams, a genius comedian who’s no longer with us.  Image Source: Daniel Smith/Disney  How good will Smith’s Genie be? One Disney executive said we should imagine a mix of Fresh Prince and Hitch. That said, we still don’t have a full trailer for the movie from Disney, where we actually get to see Smith’s Genie in action, so the image above and the footage below will have to do for the time being.

For the Kenyan holiday, see Obama Day  Barack Obama Day President Obama Observed by Illinois Type Statewide Date August 4 Frequency annual  Barack Obama Day refers to two days of recognition in the United States in honor of Barack Obama, who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.  The State of Illinois celebrates the commemorative holiday every August 4, which is Obama's birthday, beginning in 2018. Obama was a member of the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004 and represented the state in the United States Senate from 2005 to 2008 before becoming president. Similar to other commemorative holidays, it is not a legal state holiday, meaning workplaces are not closed on the day.[1]  Perry County, Alabama, has celebrated the second Monday of November as Barack Obama Day since 2009.[2] County offices and schools are closed for the holiday.[3]  History [ edit ]  Illinois [ edit ]  In 2017, Illinois State Representatives André Thapedi and Sonya Harper introduced a bill to designate Barack Obama Day as a state holiday. The original measure would have closed schools and state offices for the day. It was rejected by the House in March 2017, citing expense and the lack of a holiday for other presidents from Illinois, such as Ronald Reagan.[4]  That same year, State Senator Emil Jones III and others introduced Illinois Senate Bill 55, which designated August 4 as Barack Obama Day but did not make it an official state holiday. The bill passed both houses of the Illinois General Assembly with no votes against, and was signed into law by Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on August 4, 2017.[5] The bill amended the State Commemorative Dates Act to include a new section:  Barack Obama Day. August 4th of each year is designated as Barack Obama Day, to be observed throughout the State as a day set apart to honor the 44th President of the United States of America who began his career serving the People of Illinois in both the Illinois State Senate and the United States Senate, and dedicated his life to protecting the rights of Americans and building bridges across communities.[6]  Legislative history [ edit ]  Other recognition days [ edit ]  Since the United States presidential election of 2008, Obama Day is celebrated annually on November 6 in Kenya, the country from which President Obama’s father originated.[7]	1

"CLOSE Prince Harry admits that he “didn’t want to grow up” and considered giving up his title — before deciding to create a new role for himself within the royal family Time  Prince Harry said in an interview, ""I felt I wanted out (of the royal family), but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself."" (Photo: Matt Dunham, AP)  LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry says he once ""wanted out"" of the British royal family.  In an interview published in the Mail on Sunday, the prince said the time he spent in the army was ""the best escape I've ever had"" and that he thought about giving up his title.  He said: ""I felt I wanted out, but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself.""  Harry is fifth in line to the throne.  The comments followed an interview published in Newsweek in which he said he doubted anyone in the royal family wanted to be king or queen.  He said his family ""will carry out our duties at the right time"" and that they're ""not doing this for ourselves, but for the greater good of the people.""  Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Noah Cyrus may not be as famous as her older sister, Miley, but the next few months could be a gamechanger for the budding singer.  The 17-year-old will join Carly Rae Jepsen and Purity Ring as the opening acts for Katy Perry on the North American leg of her Witness tour, which kicks off in Montreal Sept. 19. The schedule was pushed back “due to unavoidable production delays,” Perry revealed Thursday via social media.  Cyrus, who released her debut single “Make Me (Cry)” earlier this year and garnered an MTV VMA nod for “Best New Artist,” gushed about the opportunity to perform ahead of the “Roar” singer for 21 dates on her tour.  “I’ve loved Katy since I was a little girl, and I can’t thank her enough for giving me this incredible opportunity,” the teen said. “Let’s hope I don’t f–k it up.”  Earlier this week, Miley Cyrus released the music video for her latest single, “Younger Now,” with the younger Cyrus expected to drop a full LP later this year.

"Another day, another celebrity breakup. According to reports, Sarah Hyland and Dominic Sherwood reportedly broke up after two years of dating. Hyland is one of the stars of ABC's Modern Family and Sherwood is one of the stars of Freeform's Shadowhunters. Fans are wondering: Why did Sarah Hyland and Dominic Sherwood break up? Elite Daily reached out to both Hyland and Sherwood's teams for comment, but did not hear back by time of publication.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Hyland and Sherwood's relationship had just run its course. And hey, I get that. Things are good for a while, and then you just realize you're not right for each other. It doesn't mean it was a bad relationship, it's just one that's over. The pair first met when they co-starred in Vampire Academy back in 2014. (Hyland has also had a recurring role on Sherwood's Shadowhunters recently.)  Hyland and Sherwood went public with their relationship in March 2015 when they were seen kissing at a Lakers game in Los Angeles. They used to post pictures of each other on their respective Instagrams all the time, but Hyland hasn't posted anything about Sherwood since April 15, and Sherwood hasn't posted anything about Hyland since April 22.  Of course, Instagram posts realistically have nothing to do with the status of any given relationship. But that's just about the only indication we've had that these two were going to call it quits (albeit a very, very small indication). They celebrated their two-year anniversary in Feb. 2017. Hyland posted about the anniversary on Instagram with a caption that read, ""Happy 2 year to my #1 @domsherwood.""  Sherwood talked about his love for Hyland in an interview with ET in Feb. 2017. In the interview, he said,  Sarah makes me want to be a better version of myself. That's what I love most about her. She inspires me to be the best version of me.  When she joined the cast of Shadowhunters, Sherwood said,  Everyone fell in love with her on set. It was a real joy ... She's been coming in since season one, coming to visit me. Having her on set as an actress was just phenomenal.  At this point it's unclear why Hyland and Sherwood broke up, but it was wonderful while it lasted!"	0

"Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). (ASTRID RIECKEN/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  This post was originally published in 2017 and has been updated.  There are decades worth of stories about the political career of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) that have nothing to do with President Trump. But as we remember the senior senator, who died Saturday at 81 after being diagnosed with brain cancer, it’s undeniable that McCain played an outsize role in Trump’s campaign and presidency. At first he was reluctantly pulled into it, but in the last year of his life, McCain was leading the battle for the soul for the Republican Party.  Let's start from the beginning. Barely a month into then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential run, McCain almost inadvertently ended it. Or so many thought.  “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, okay? I hate to tell you. He’s a war hero because he was captured, okay?”  Well, that was it. You can't disparage a war hero who has become a living legend in Washington and expect to win the Republican presidential nomination.  McCain said he was “surprised” Trump went after him but referred to a famous Theodore Roosevelt quote about the difference between talkers and doers. “I'm in the arena, as T.R. used to say.” In other words: Trump ain't nothing to me.  He soon would be. Trump won the Republican nomination. And McCain, whether he wanted to or not, would go on to play a central role in the rest of Trump’s political narrative, a symbol of the establishment Republican Party that Trump stomped on to snatch victory.  McCain may not have liked the guy (he questioned his fitness to be commander in chief), but like most dutiful Republicans, he respected what Trump had done. He endorsed Trump for president.  The decision would test McCain many more times. Weeks later, Trump battled a Gold Star parent who spoke at the Democrats' nominating convention. McCain was fuming.  “I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement,” McCain's Senate campaign said in a statement. “I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.”  Trump predictably didn't like that. He told The Washington Post that he might or might not support McCain, who was running for a sixth term in the Senate, in his primary. He said he had no interest in apologizing to McCain for the war hero spat.  Trump's threat to undermine McCain, among other GOP leaders, would later be remembered as a giant middle finger to the Republican Party that had just swallowed its pride and given him the nomination.  At this point, McCain's Democratic opponent was running ads tying McCain to Trump's most controversial comments about immigrants and women.  And the rest of us were asking: How in the world is McCain still supporting Trump anyway?  (Because, politics, surmised The Fix's Aaron Blake: “If McCain wants to be renominated, it's perhaps best not to alienate the many Arizona Republicans that backed Trump and turn this into a Trump vs. McCain primary."")  McCain did win that primary. Literally a day later, he ditched Trump. Given that McCain had gritted through Trump’s pummeling for more than a year without saying much, it was a high-profile defection.  In a gauzy, five-minute video, he basically acknowledged that he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win and pitched himself as a bulwark against a Democratic president.  “If Hillary Clinton is elected president, Arizona will need a senator who will act as a check — not a rubber stamp — for the White House,” he said.  Once again, McCain didn't get what he wanted. Trump is now President Trump.  But both safely elected and back in Washington, McCain let his true colors fly. He became Trump's chief Republican antagonist in the Senate.  Shortly after Trump got elected, McCain was one of the first GOP senators to express reservations about Trump’s Cabinet nominees. When “pigs fly,” McCain said when asked if he would support Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. (He eventually did but since said he sometimes regrets it.)  McCain was one of the first senators of either party to demand an independent investigation into Russia meddling.  Last summer came the moment Trump will never forget. After announcing his diagnosis of brain cancer, McCain gave a surprise ""no"" vote that ended Republicans' efforts to repeal Obamacare. Trump has brought up that ""no"" vote every chance he gets.  [Trump can't stop dissing John McCain]  McCain used his last few months in Washington to deliver series of speeches with increasingly alarmist language about Trump.  ""We're getting nothing done,"" he scolded his colleagues on the Senate floor.  “We have to fight [against Trumpism],” McCain told Naval Academy midshipmen, describing Trump’s foreign policy as nothing more than “crackpot conspiracy theories.”  “We are not his subordinates,” he warned his party in an op-ed, referring to the president.  At the end of 2017, McCain left Washington for treatment of his cancer. But even from his home in Arizona, he continued to poke Trump where it hurt. At a critical moment this spring when Trump’s CIA nominee was on thin ice to get approved by the Senate, McCain publicly engineered a bid to try to tank her confirmation by urging his colleagues to vote against her.  The last major public spat between the two was ugly. Trump and his White House refused to publicly apologize for a crude comment a former aide made about McCain’s imminent death. McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, said people who defend that aide “are going to have to answer for their own conscience.”  McCain's last defiant act of the Trump era was to write a book. It was a memoir that mourned for a time past in politics and compared Trump to a despot.  “I would like to see us recover our sense that we are more alike than different,” he wrote. “Even in times of political turmoil such as these, we share that awesome heritage and the responsibility to embrace it.”  In the beginning, McCain was caught off guard by how Trump's nascent and chaotic presidential campaign sucked him into the center of its vortex. He wrote in his memoir that he didn't know what to make of Trump's convictions.  In the last year of his life, McCain transformed himself into a willing leader of the resistance."	1
As stars made their way from the red carpet to the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, “Manus x Machina,” Vogue challenged some of the Met Gala’s most-followed guests to strut their stuff inside our futuristic Instagram portrait studio. For a few glorious hours, fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night’s most jeweled and shimmering fashion.  It’s a testament to the gala’s tech-tinged theme that each guest seemed to come alive inside the lighted space. Siblings Jaden and Willow Smith performed an impromptu dance-off. Léa Seydoux followed with a leggy number so good, it compelled Willow to say to the French actress: “I just want to tell you that you’re beautiful, and I love you.” And Madonna, dressed in a Givenchy bodysuit, clung to the walls and slithered to the ground as Riccardo Tisci applauded from the sidelines. “That was your cardio!” Tisci cheered. The Balmain army—Cindy Crawford, Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn, Doutzen Kroes, and Alessandra Ambrosio—assembled in rhinestone frocks and put on their best faces. “My daughter is going to be so embarrassed by that,” Crawford quipped on her way out.  Even the most reserved guests took to twirling, laughing, and sashaying for the camera. Elle Fanning whipped her hair back and forth so enthusiastically, she had to run to the loo to fix her ponytail. But sometimes less is more. Just take a look at Vogue’s Editor in Chief, Anna Wintour, who mesmerized while remaining perfectly still.	0
"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July."	1
FKA twigs is opening up about a health struggle that she says “knocked” her “confidence as a woman.”  The singer revealed on Instagram, Wednesday, that she underwent laparoscopic surgery in December to have six fibroid tumors removed from her uterus. She compared the tumors’ sizes to two apples, three kiwis and a few strawberries — “a fruit bowl of pain everyday,” she wrote — and added that the weight and size of the growths was proportional to being six months pregnant.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I tried to be brave but it was excruciating at times and to be honest I started to doubt if my body would ever feel the same again,” she shared. “I had surgery in December and I was so scared, despite lots of love from friends and family I felt really alone and my confidence as a woman was knocked.”  FKA twigs, who split from fiancé Robert Pattinson last year, said she struggled with the decision to come forward about her battle. However, a dance session sparked her confidence.  “Today whilst dancing with Kelly at the choreography house I felt like my strong self again for the first time in a while and it was magical,” she captioned the black and white video of her doing a pole dancing routine. “Thank you precious body for healing, thank you for reminding me to be kind to myself, you are a wonderful thing, now go create and be other once again <3.”  The 30-year-old then shared a message to others dealing with similar health scares.  “I know that a lot of women suffer from fibroid tumours and I just wanted to say after my experience that you are amazing warriors and that you are not alone. you can get through this,” she said, signing off on her post, “and with this I let go of the pain… love always twigs.”  Matt Crossick/PA Images/Getty  Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that most commonly occur between ages 30 and 40, with black women being most highly affected.  “There is virtually no threat of malignancy — and there are a number of excellent treatment options, as well as the option to do nothing at all — so there really is no reason to worry,” Steve Goldstein, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Medical Center, told WebMD.  Although most women with the condition have no symptoms, they can cause abdominal pain or uterine bleeding, Dr. Aydin Arici, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Yale University School of Medicine, told WebMD. In some cases, the tumors could cause infertility or pregnancy loss.  FKA twigs got plenty of support from her fans, as well as a few celebrity pals.  “Amazing!!” Jenna Dewan commented on the video. “Sending you so much love and healing.”  Perez Hilton added, “Thank you for sharing! You are a superwoman!!!”	0
Suri Cruise has begged her famous father Tom, “Daddy, come home!”  RadarOnline.com exclusively learned their strained relationship could be repaired after she implored him to visit her, a source said.  Suri, 12, whose mom is Tom’s ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes, 39, has been contacting her dad through a series of heartbreaking letters, calls and voicemails, the insider has revealed.  PHOTOS: Aircraft Simulator & Spy Towers: Tom Cruise Builds His OWN Scientology Lair  Although Katie’s rep has denied it, according to the source, the little girl has begged Tom, 56, to come and visit and the Mission Impossible star has finally responded to Suri.  “He’s contacted Suri through a third party, who he trusts implicitly, to check in and make sure she’s okay,” the spy said. “He wants her to know that he’s thought of her all this time and that he got all of her messages. In fact, he read and listened to each and every word.  “Tom’s paving the way to come back into Suri’s life permanently—and many expect it to happen soon.”  PHOTOS: Tom Cruise Through The Years  In June 2012, Holmes ended her marriage to Tom and things have reportedly been hard between him and Suri ever since.  A second source said of Tom, “He was absent for one milestone after another” in Suri’s life.  Although Holmes is constantly photographed with her daughter, fans have wondered why Tom is so rarely seen with Suri.  PHOTOS: Packing On The Pounds? Tom Cruise UNRECOGNIZABLE In New Photos  “That would be painful for any child—you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it [took] on Suri,” the source said.  The Church of Scientology requires members to “disconnect” with those who leave the controversial faith and “Tom couldn’t reach out [to Suri] before because Katie fled the religion,” the source said.  Tom, a top celebrity in Scientology, “believes he can bypass the rigid rule.”  The superstar is building a home base in Florida to help build up Church membership, “but what he’s really doing is setting the stage for a reunion with Suri,” the insider explained.  PHOTOS: Tom Cruise’s 21-Year-Old DJ Son Spinning Out Of Control — CAUGHT Cavorting With Semi-Clad Women  Suri has “made a plea to Katie to let her see her dad,” and Katie, who recently denied that she has split from longtime boyfriend Jamie Foxx, is all for it.  “Katie would never stand in the way of Suri having a relationship with her father. If that’s what Tom wants, the better.”  The source added that Tom “feels like he’s missed out so much. He wants her to be a part of his life.”  We pay for juicy info!

She usually keeps mum about her private life, but Nelly Furtado revealed in a new interview on Wednesday that she’s back on the market.  “I am single now,” she said on ITV’s Loose Women about secretly splitting from Demacio Castellon last summer. “Someone here needs to update my Wikipedia. It’s not helping my dating life!”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The singer, 38, wed the sound engineer in 2008 in an ultra-private ceremony that they kept hidden from the public until more than a year later.  “I went through an emotionally difficult time last summer and I actually wrote and sung myself songs to get through it,” Furtado, who’s currently promoting her sixth studio album, The Ride, said about the breakup. “I would sing to myself while I drove on these long drives, and I thought to myself, ‘I’m so lucky that I can write songs because I can soothe myself with them.'”  And though she’s still working through her heartbreak, the star says she’s focusing on her 13-year-old daughter, Nevis (with ex Jasper Gahunia).  “Sometimes you just want to sit home and bake some muffins for your daughter. I need to stay mentally and emotionally and physically well for my daughter,” she said.  In 2014, Furtado opened up about collaborating with Castellon on both her 2006 album, Loose, and her Spanish-language album, Mi Plan, which went platinum and won a Latin Grammy for best female pop vocal.  “It’s a healthy tension working together,” she told PEOPLE. “It doesn’t always go smoothly, of course, and it can be really challenging when there are differences of opinion, which of course happens.”  “We’re very blessed to have a beautiful family. We have a great life together. Life is good,” she added.	0
At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites — including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. “Gwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,” a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. “Blake sang a lot in her direction.” At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: “Their dog was having puppies and they couldn’t wait to get home!”  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. “Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,” an insider shares in the new issue. “Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.”  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it’s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is “absolutely devoted” to Gwen’s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: “Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.”  Shelton’s devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. “Blake has always wanted children,” explains a friend. “And he’s great with Gwen’s kids, which prompted them wanting their own.”  The No Doubt singer was all in — but not anymore. “Not because of a change in her love for Blake,” explains the source, “but because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.” The country star is on board with her thoughts. “He is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,” shares the insider.  With no baby, they’ve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, “Gwen is very traditional and wouldn’t want to be pregnant without being married.”  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. “Their relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,” explains the source. “The need to get married and have kids isn’t the priority it once was.”  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an “easy, effortless love” together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton’s Oklahoma ranch — something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? “Gwen loves hanging out with Blake’s friends and wives,” says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples’ trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.

For many years Ashlee Simpson was simply known as Jessica Simpson’s younger sister, but through her own musical career she began to take on the spotlight for herself. After her highly publicized marriage and divorce from Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz, Ashlee Simpson has once again found love with Evan Ross who is an actor and musician, and also the son of the iconic singer Diana Ross. Now the twosome are one of Hollywood’s most adorable and low-key couples, so here are 7 things you never knew about the pair and their relationship.  7. Friends First  Many times Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross’ romance has been called a “whirlwind” relationship because of the pace in which they started dating and became engaged. What many don’t know, however, is that the pair were actually friends first. The two actually first met in the early 2000s while on the Hollywood club scene and had many mutual friends which meant they hung out regularly, so they were friends for 10 years before starting a romantic relationship.  ADVERTISEMENT  2  6. Working Together  After some success with her own music, Ashlee Simpson revealed that not only was she making her comeback to music in 2017, but was doing so with her husband! At an event in late 2016 she stated, “We’re working on an album together. So in the new year that will be happening!” She added that she was excited to work with Ross. “It’s been really fun to work together. This way we can tour together! I’m definitely excited. I love working with my husband. The sound is soulful, fun and reflective of the music we both like. When you work separately you don’t get to hang out — so this works out well.”	1
Angelina Jolie is feeling vindicated by Jennifer Aniston’s split from husband Justin Theroux. We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE details why she’s not shocked by their separation.    Jennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux‘s sudden split shocked the world, with the exception of her arch-enemy Angelina Jolie. While the 42-year-old humanitarian has long been blamed for the former Friends star’s 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, 54, she’s now feeling a sense of vindication that she had nothing to do with America’s Sweetheart’s latest heartbreak. “Angelina makes a point to not read or follow any celebrity gossip, but it was inevitable she would hear about Jennifer and Justin’s break-up at some point. Angelina has never cared for Jen, even before she started dating Brad. She’s always thought of her as very vanilla and shallow, and not on her level intellectually. Whereas Justin is quirky and edgy and super smart, so Angelina wasn’t surprised at all to learn they had split,” a source close to the Maleficent star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  While the now former couple vowed to remain close friends despite the breakup, numerous sources out of his NYC circle seem to be feeding the media that artsy Justin felt stifled by Jen’s easy, breezy California lifestyle and longed to be back home full-time in the Big Apple. He always did seem like a somewhat strange fit for Jennifer, as the actor constantly wore nothing but black motorcycle jackets and had a gold gun pendant around his neck at all times. Everything about him seemed to exude dark, edgy rebel while the actress is a sunny yoga loving Cali-gal.  Angelina has long been blamed for Jen’s heartbreaking split from Brad after they allegedly fell in love while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while the actor was still very married. Even though Brangelina was together for 11 years, married in 2014 and has six children together, the United Nations humanitarian is reveling in the fact that she had nothing to do with Jennifer’s current marriage demise.  “Angelina can’t help feeling a degree of vindication, after all, she was painted as this evil home wrecker who lured Brad away from Jen, who was portrayed as this sweet and nice, poor helpless victim. But nobody can point the finger at Angelina this time, or any other ‘wicked’ third party, as by all accounts neither Justin or Jen were cheating. So this time around Jennifer can’t blame somebody else for the failure of her marriage. It’s all on her and Justin,” our insider adds. Well, at least there won’t be any more “Team Aniston” and Team Jolie” t-shirts being sold after Jen’s latest heartbreak.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Jen will go on to find true love again after her split from Justin?	1

""All I really want to do is tell you that I'm feeling great. I'm glad I spent that evening in the hospital, and it did me a lot of good,"" the 95-year-old said Thursday with his sense of humor in tact. ""Now, I'm home and looking for new trouble to get into — you know, the usual.""  Regarding reports he suffered an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath, Lee said, ""I figured that a little check-up wouldn't be bad for me, and it fact it turned out to be pretty good 'cause it got me a lot of publicity.

We all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics. You know it, I know it, Paul Ryan knows it, Donald Trump knows it. Well, Trump probably doesn’t, because, well, he’s delusional.But it’s really, really bad. And historically unpopular, like the President whose name will forever be attached to it.Maybe you aren’t totally convinced about how bad it is yet. So there’s this: Under this plan, a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.“Yeah, but they’re the party of ‘Blue Lives Matter’ and thanking everyone who ever wore a uniform for anything for their service!” you might say. And I have some oceanfront property in Idaho to sell you if you believe that.Salon reports, Donald Trump often declares his support, even love, for police, firefighters and other first responders. That isn’t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.Buried in the hastily drafted tax bill’s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating “miscellaneous” deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.This year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.But that’s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.Add police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.Shameful.	1
"Mr Markle, who turns 74 on Wednesday, said all he cares about is to make peace with his estranged daughter and become part of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s lives.  And to achieve this, he will keep releasing interviews, despite his daughter and her husband, Prince Harry being said to have grown “frustrated” with his continued appearance on the media.  The former lightning and photography director told TMZ: ""I was silent for a full year and the press beat me up every day saying I was a hermit hiding in Mexico, so I gave my story.  ""Apparently that interview put the Royal Family in their silence mode... so, I gave another interview to break the silence.  “All they have to do is speak to me.”"	1

""Every now and then, I get a Christmas card,"" the Boyhood actor, 44, told the paper.  PHOTOS: Celebrity holiday cards!

"On Thursday, it was announced that she had parted ways with Justin Theroux, after just two-and-a-half years of marriage.  And it has now been reported that Jennifer Aniston, 49, had stopped regularly spending time with the actor and writer several months before they made their shocking announcement.  According to TMZ, the former Friends star was last seen at her estranged husband's apartment in New York City's Greenwich Village in October, with sources telling the website that she'd stopped regular visits as far back as August.  Separated: Jennifer Aniston reportedly stopped regularly spending time with Justin Theroux several months ago, and was last photographed by TMZ at his New York City home in October  A further report from ETOnline suggests the couple split over a disagreement about where they should live.  Sources close to the pair have claimed that a difference of opinion on where to live was one of the main causes for the break up, with Jennifer preferring Los Angeles, while Justin opting for New York.  An insider explained to ETOnline: 'He much prefers being [in New York] and that's been a major issue for them for a long time.  'Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they're not all 'in the industry. He's friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It's an eclectic group and he doesn't have that type of network in LA.  'Justin can hop on his [motorcycle], walk in the neighborhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her.  Separation: The estranged couple reportedly signed an 'iron-clad' pre-nup before their August 2015 wedding, reports US Weekly  'He really wanted her to be comfortable [in New York. He even negotiated with the paps to make a deal that they would only shoot her once per day and then leave her alone. He also agreed to move out of his apartment, which he loves.'  'She just never really could get settled in, she wasn't happy [in New York. He was bicoastal, she was not.'  According to The Sun, the paparazzi is another reason for the split, after they took up residency in a park opposite their home, which infuriated the neighbours.  It's said that because of this, said neighbours covered Justin's beloved motorcycle with bits of Bologna sausage one day in an act of protest.  Split: A source told the website: 'Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense'  Justin apparently blamed Jennifer for this, as the paparazzi were pestering the couple more so for pictures of her, rather than him.  The source added that the pair fought to make their relationship work but were ultimately unsuccessful.  The insider explained: 'They really were a great couple. And they cared a lot about each other. Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.'  While the exes have yet to file for divorce, it has also been claimed they had taken a crucial step to protect their multi-million dollar fortunes, with an 'iron-clad' pre-nup signed before their August 2015 wedding, reports US Weekly.  A source told the publication: 'Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense. Jen’s assets and Friends fortune are protected.'  Acclaimed: Jennifer, 49, who is most famous for her portrayal of Rachel Green on iconic sitcom Friends, is worth an estimated $200m (above with L-R co-stars Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Courtney Cox)  Jennifer, who is most famous for her portrayal of Rachel Green on iconic sitcom Friends, is worth an estimated $200 million.  For the last two seasons of Friends, which ran between 1994 and 2004, Jennifer and her five co-stars were paid a record $1 million an episode.  She has also starred in a string of hit films including Horrible Bosses, Bruce Almighty, and He's Just Not That Into You, amassed an impressive property portfolio and is the face of campaigns included SmartWater.  Justin, who has starred in TV shows The Leftovers, Parks and Recreation and Sex and The City, as well as worked as a screenwriter on films including Tropic Thunder, and Zoolander 2, is worth an estimated $20 million.  Talented: She has also starred in a string of hit films including Horrible Bosses (above), Bruce Almighty, and He's Just Not That Into You  MailOnline has contacted representatives for Jennifer and Justin for comment.  The decision to go their separate ways 'was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year', according to a statement released on Thursday through Jennifer's publicist.  The Along Came Polly star became engaged to the Leftovers actor in August 2012, and they married in a surprise ceremony at their LA home on August 5, 2015.  The couple's statement says they would have handled their separation privately, but they wanted to counter tabloid speculation and 'convey the truth directly.'  They say they intend to maintain love and respect for each other.  Jennifer and Justin were last pictured together during a New Year's getaway trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  Multi-millions: Justin, 46, who has starred in TV shows including The Leftovers (above), Parks and Recreation and Sex and The City, as well as worked as a screenwriter on films including Tropic Thunder, and Zoolander 2, is worth an estimated $20m.  The shock split will come as a surprise to many as Justin had previously described Jennifer as his 'ally'.  He shared with United Airlines' Rhapsody magazine back in April 2017: 'Marriage makes the small things much smaller and the big things small. You have an ally. It's good to have someone have your back.'The couple tied the knot in August 2015 and it was made 'so much more special' because they kept it secret.  Justin added: 'It's so much more special when it's just your closest friends and family and it's lovely. [Jennifer and I] wanted it to be a peaceful environment, you don't want it to be hectic.'  Justin had admitted being married to Jennifer has had a calming effect on him.  He explained: 'Obviously, I'm married. I think marriage taught me to settle a little bit. It does have a calming effect. I think it's at what age you make that commitment. When you hear about people in the '50s getting married at 20, you're like, What were they thinking?  Spark: The two reconnected and ultimately began dating when working together in 2012's Wanderlust, five years after meeting on the set of Tropic Thunder  'My grandparents were together for over 50 years. My grandfather used to write one sentence every day in his journal: ""I love Anne more than ever today."" I think that was his meditation - keeping him in his marriage, and also his appreciation for it. It was very touching.'  Jennifer and Justin met on set of Ben Stiller and Jack Black comedy Tropic Thunder in 2007.  The two reconnected and ultimately began dating when working together in 2012's Wanderlust.  They got engaged on his 41st birthday while dining at Dan Barber restaurant Blue Hill in Greenwich Village, New York City in August 2012.  Three years later Jennifer and Justin married in a top secret ceremony at their home in Los Angeles in August 2016.  Jennifer was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005."	0
Image via Splash  Ok, so it was a little awkward.  Kevin Hart and wife Eniko celebrated the upcoming arrival of their son, and did so in a lavish jungle-themed party attended by family and friends. The event took place at the Calamigos Beach Club in Malibu.  During the party, the name of their son was revealed as Kenzo. And to celebrate that, Hart wore clothing from the brand Kenzo, the little one’s name was emblazoned on the photo booth wall, and “KENZO” was spelled out on top of the dessert table in big blue letters.  Updates of the event were shared on Snapchat throughout the day, where Kevin did his best to show that he and Eniko are doing just fine following the controversial cheating and extortion scandal she had to deal with earlier this month.  Before the celebration took place, there was a report that the star had dished out $118,000 for the baby shower. Despite that though, they cut corners on the animals, opting for golden retrievers with faux lion manes as opposed to actual big cats. Kevin joked about it in a Snapchat video.  “We couldn’t afford a lion, so we just got a dog and put the thing around the dog,” he said. “It’s still ballin’, it’s just on a budget.”  This will be the first child for Eniko, 33, and the third for Kevin, 38, who has Heavenly and Hendrix from his marriage to Torrei Hart. His kids were present to help celebrate their new baby brother.  When speaking to Good Morning America about expecting another child back in June, Hart joked that despite it being something he planned with Eniko, he wasn’t ready to be a dad again.  “I kept buying dogs. I held off for a long time,” Hart said. “Every time she brought a baby up, I just showed up with a dog. Eventually, she was like, ‘No. I want to have a kid.’ I was like, ‘I got two kids. We’re married. My kids are your kids.’ She was like, ‘I know, but they’re grown. I want new ones.’ I was like, ‘Stop talking about my kids like they’re used cars.’ I was like ‘Alright, no, I get it. You’re absolutely right. I want to have a baby.’ So then we decided to have a baby. We actually planned it.”  And he’s a-comin’!  Check out pictures from the event below, which, all things considered, looked like it turned out quite lovely:	0
UPDATE: 2/13/2017: Billy Bush is officially on the new season of DWTS.  Dancing With the Stars is in the process of putting together the list of contestants for the next show, and reportedly, former Today show host Billy Bush wants to do whatever he has to do to be on that list, even if that means taking a pay cut. Since he was fired from Today, Bush has not had a job, and allegedly took a killing on his New York City townhouse he bought when he thought he’d be moving to New York for Today.  DWTS has been the place that stars go to either take a victory lap, or say they are sorry through dance, says the Inquisitr. Billy Bush left Today with many of his co-workers angry with him, after a video was released of him palling around with Donald Trump, talking about grabbing women against their will, and what you can do when you are entitled. Just after his exit, DWTS was showing interest in Bush, but at the time, his agent brushed them off, perhaps assuming that other offers would come rolling in, but they haven’t.  ‘Desperate’ Billy Bush Begging To Be Cast On ‘DWTS’ https://t.co/CPQNpIXobq via @radar_online — Wackymoe (@wackymoe) February 10, 2017  Radar Online is saying that “disgraced former Today show host” Billy Bush is desperate to salvage what is left of his career with a spot on DWTS. A production insider associated with DWTS says that Bush is “begging to be on the cast of DWTS Season 24.”  RELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR  Billy Bush ‘Today Show’ Colleagues Comment On His Suspension  The Real Reason The ‘Today Show’ And NBC Won’t Be Taking Billy…  Billy Bush Lawyer Says Bush’s Career May Have Ended In 2005 If He…  ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Assumes Billy Bush Is Done, Wants Him To…  And Billy Bush supposedly is willing to do whatever he needs to do to get a spot on the cast.  “Billy said he would be willing to take a pay cut, and take a sum much lower than the other contestants.”  Because this woman is all women. Because this woman is my daughter. Because this woman is me. #whyiresist @realDonaldTrump @BillyBush_Real pic.twitter.com/PHtdXdUsfd — LunchLettersFromMom (@Resist_LoveMom) February 9, 2017  But sources are saying that many of the executives at ABC are having serious problems with allowing Billy Bush to come aboard Season 24 of DWTS. It seems that there are still plenty of people who want nothing to do with him, and think he would be negative for the ratings.  “The higher-ups are tired of having celebs wanting to join DWTS as a way of doing damage control.”  An example of this would be Ryan Lochte, who signed up for DWTS as a way to say he was sorry for embarrassing the American men’s swim team after lying about an incident at the Rio Olympics.  “A lot of them are also sick of having contestants who want to be cast as a way of reviving their broken career, which is exactly what some believe Billy is trying to do!”  The Observer says that Billy Bush is due for a win, after losing his job on Today, and reportedly taking a million dollar loss on his Chelsea townhouse. Bush bought the townhouse at 224 West 22nd Street after getting the Today job for $8.8 million, and then tried to relist it for $9 million.  After no bites, the price was lowered, and finally, Bush accepted an offer of $7.43 million. The house has now been stripped, and is ready for whatever the new owners plan to do with it. But don’t feel too bad for Bush, because he has some other nice real estate holdings to visit now that he has officially sold his Chelsea place. Bush owns an Encino ranch-estate, and a home in Park City, Utah.  #DWTS 2017 Cast Lineup: Billy Bush Tops List Of 12 Celebs Rumored To Be Joining Season 24 Cast https://t.co/rA2HzMjMA5 pic.twitter.com/xokUMu4xNv — TheScooponess (@TheScooponess) February 8, 2017  Do you think that the producers at DWTS will give Billy Bush one of the positions on Season 24 of the ABC dance competition?

Photo: Byron Cohen (ABC)  While Scandals may blow over, co-stars may die, and even living content well Shonda Rhimes might depart for richer, more digital pastures, the core crew at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital continues to soldier on. Variety reports that ABC has just renewed its functionally unkillable medical drama Grey’s Anatomy for a landmark 15th season, officially making the show the network’s longest-running primetime drama series ever.  Still starring Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey, a woman who has seen some serious shit by this point, the show remains one of ABC’s highest-rated offerings despite its advancing years. Hence, presumably, why the network continues to renew the series, even after creator Rhimes announced last year that she was jumping ship to start developing shows for Netflix. (Rhimes will continue to serve as a producer on Grey’s and her other ABC shows for as long as they continue to run, although it’s worth noting that Krista Vernnoff is the series’ actual showrunner.)  Advertisement  Grey’s recently aired its 300th episode, planting it firmly in Gunsmoke, ER, and Law & Order territory when it comes to mainstream longevity in TV.	0
Legal battle with ex husband leave's the star's family 'desperately worried about her.'  Despite a tumultuous custody battle with ex Kevin Federline, Radar Online reports that Britney Spears may have other things on her plate that would explain her erratic behavior.  The publication broke the news that Spears is “desperate” for Sam Asghari, her current love interest, to propose, “but he’s dragging his feet and stalling.”  After completing a successful run of shows in Las Vegas, Spears allegedly immediately turned her attention to tying the knot with her 23-year-old boyfriend.  The same source claims that the real reasoning behind Spears being impatient is because of her immediate urge to have children with Asghari.  “All she can talk about right now is having a baby. She wants a girl so bad and she’s madly in love with Sam.”  Asghari however, apparently is hesitant to act on Spear’s marriage advances, citing that he may not be mentally ready to completely settle down with the famous performer.  While this all occurs, Spears also is caught up in a heated legal battle with ex, Federline.  He is reportedly asking the star for more money in spousal and child support to help take care of himself along with their young children, Sean and Jayden.  Matthew Simmons / Getty Images  The same source mentioned that “She’s freaking out over this court deposition and doesn’t see an end in sight to all the ugliness with Kevin.”  Spears met Federline, a professional dancer, in April 2004 and, aside from the fact that he already had a child on the way with ex-fiancée Shar Jackson, whom, at the time, he had only been split from for a very short period. Federline and Spears were engaged by July of that year.  Their marriage ceremony took place on September 18, 2004, with son Sean Preston being born barely a year later. Jayden James, their second son, was born a year after that. However, by November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline and began pursuing other romantic interests.  All of the drama surrounding Spears is prompting those closest to her to state that they are worried she may spiral off into something akin to her most famous public meltdown over a decade ago when she had shaved her head amongst other media-covered reckless acts.  However, the source still described the situation best by saying that “There are still some major demons that Britney has to fight on a daily basis, and her workload never lets up. She feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and her family’s desperately worried about her.”	1

Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most successful actresses in terms of box office receipts.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014).  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2007 Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $140 million.[7] She has been named the world's most beautiful woman by People a record five times.  Early life and family [ edit ]  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][8] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][8][9] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[10][11] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Roman Catholic,[12] and she was raised Catholic.[13][14] Her older brother, Eric Roberts, from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, sister Lisa Roberts Gillan, and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors.  Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts was their daughter Yolanda Denise King's acting coach.[15] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[16]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[17] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[18] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[19] The couple had a daughter, Nancy Motes, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[20] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[19] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[21]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[22] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[23][24] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[25][26]  Acting career [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series Crime Story with Dennis Farina, in the episode titled ""The Survivor"", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film Mystic Pizza in 1988;[27] that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of Miami Vice. In 1989, she was featured in Steel Magnolias, as a young bride with diabetes, and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actress) and first Golden Globe Award win (Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress) for her performance.[27]  1990s [ edit ]  Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella/Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990.[27] Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.[28] The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy).[27] Her next box office success was the thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, playing a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. She played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook in 1991, and also played a nurse in the 1991 film, Dying Young. This work was followed by a two-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, ""What Happened to Julia Roberts?""[29] She was offered the role of Annie Reed in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham's 1992 novel of the same name.[27] In 1996, she appeared in season 2 of Friends (episode 13 ""The One After the Superbowl"").[31] She had a relationship with cast member Matthew Perry at the time.[32][33][34][35] According to an audience member, Roberts said to Perry about their on-screen kiss, ""I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend.""[36] She was offered the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz in While You Were Sleeping (1995), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Liam Neeson in Michael Collins (1996).[27] That same year, she starred in Stephen Frears' Mary Reilly, which was a commercial failure. In 1997, however, she enjoyed renewed success with the romantic comedy My Best Friend's Wedding. In 1998, she appeared on Sesame Street opposite the character Elmo, demonstrating her ability to change emotions. She was offered the role of Viola de Lesseps in Shakespeare in Love (1998) but turned it down.[30] She starred in the films Stepmom (1998), alongside Susan Sarandon,[37] Notting Hill (1999), with Hugh Grant, and, also in 1999, in Runaway Bride, her second film with Richard Gere. Roberts was a guest star on the Law & Order television series episode ""Empire"" with series regular Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[38]  2000s [ edit ]  In 2000, she played the lead role of real-life environmental activist Erin Brockovich in the film Erin Brockovich.  In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest-paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 50 most influential women in show business since the list had begun in 1992.[3]  In 2001, Roberts received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Erin Brockovich. Roberts' acceptance speech for the award went over the allowed time limit but did not mention the real-life Brockovich, for which Roberts later apologized, saying she forgot.[39] While presenting the Best Actor Award to Denzel Washington the following year, Roberts made a gaffe, saying she was glad that Tom Conti wasn't there; she meant the conductor, Bill Conti, who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor.[40]  Roberts' first film following Erin Brockovich was the road gangster comedy, The Mexican, giving her a chance to work with long-time friend Brad Pitt. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[41] Later in 2001, she starred in the romantic comedy America's Sweethearts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked ""sympathetic characters"" and was ""only funny in spurts.""[42] A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however.[43]  In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven, a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played Tess Ocean, the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is dating a casino owner played by Andy García. In preparation for her role, Roberts studied Dickinson's performance by watching the original film at least seven times in order to get her part right.[44] A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean's Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of US$450 million worldwide.[45]  In 2003, Roberts was cast in Mike Newell's drama film Mona Lisa Smile, also starring Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles. Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.[46] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it ""predictable and safe"".[47]  In 2004, Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols's Closer, a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name.[48] The film also starred Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.[48] Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to what the film's characters believe is their strong resemblance.[49] Though less well reviewed than Eleven, the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.[50] Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series' third and final installment, Ocean's Thirteen (2007), due to script issues.[51] In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single ""Dreamgirl"" by the Dave Matthews Band; it was her first music video appearance.[52]  Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005.[5]  Eat Pray Love, September 2010 Roberts in Paris promoting, September 2010  Roberts had two films released in 2006: The Ant Bully and Charlotte's Web. Both films were animated features for which she provided voice acting.[53][54] Her next film was Charlie Wilson's War (2007), with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols; it was released on December 21, 2007.[55] Fireflies in the Garden (2008), also starring Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe, was released at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas; it did not get a North American release until 2011.[56]  Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg's 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[57] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with ""self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.""[58] Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that ""it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.""[58] Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, ""Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain—even if three days of it can seem an eternity.""[59]  In 2009, Lancôme announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company.[60]  2010s [ edit ]  Roberts at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival  Roberts starred with Clive Owen in the comedy-thriller Duplicity for which she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. In 2010, she appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, with Cooper, and starred in the film adaptation of Eat Pray Love. Eat Pray Love[61] had the highest debut at the box office for Roberts in a top-billed role since America's Sweethearts.[62] Later in the year, she signed a five-year extension with Lancôme for GB£32 million.[63] In 2011, she co-starred as Mercedes Tainot in the romantic comedy Larry Crowne opposite Tom Hanks, who directed and played the title role.[64] The movie received generally bad reviews with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings,[65] although Roberts's comedic performance was praised.[66] Roberts appeared in the 2012 Tarsem Singh adaptation of Snow White, titled Mirror Mirror, playing Queen Clementianna, Snow White's evil stepmother.[67]  In 2013, Roberts appeared in August: Osage County, playing one of Meryl Streep's character's three daughters.[68] Her performance earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics' Choice Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, amongst other accolades.[69][70][71][72] It was her fourth Academy Award nomination.[73]  In 2014, Roberts narrated ""Women in Hollywood"", an episode of season 2 of Makers: Women Who Make America.[74] Roberts appears in Givenchy's spring/summer 2015 campaign.[75][76] In 2016, she starred in the film Mother's Day, the film received ""overwhelmingly negative reviews"" but was a moderate box office success grossing $48.5 million on a $25 million budget. The same year she also starred as television director Patty Fynn in the thriller Money Monster directed by Jodie Foster and also starring George Clooney and Jack O'Connell.[77][78][79]  In June 2017, Roberts announced she will be starring in a limited series for HBO, based on the Maria Semple novel, Today Will Be Different. This will be Roberts' first television series.[80]  Film production [ edit ]  Roberts runs the production company Red Om Films with her sister, Lisa Roberts Gillan, and Marisa Yeres Gill.[81] Through Red Om, Roberts served as an executive producer of the first four films of the American Girl film series (based on the American Girl line of dolls), released between 2004 and 2008.[82]  Personal life [ edit ]  Relationships and marriages [ edit ]  Roberts had romantic relationships with actors Jason Patric, Liam Neeson, Kiefer Sutherland, Dylan McDermott, and Matthew Perry.[83][84] She was briefly engaged to Sutherland; they broke up three days before their scheduled wedding on June 11, 1991.[85] On June 25, 1993, she married country singer Lyle Lovett; the wedding took place at St. James Lutheran Church in Marion, Indiana.[86] They separated in March 1995 and subsequently divorced.[87] From 1998 to 2001, Roberts dated actor Benjamin Bratt.[88]  Roberts and her husband, cameraman Daniel Moder, met on the set of her film The Mexican in 2000 while she was still dating Bratt. At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg. He filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalized, he and Roberts wed on July 4, 2002,[89] at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico.[90] Together, they have three children: twins Hazel Patricia and Phinnaeus Walter Moder (born November 28, 2004)[91] and son, Henry Daniel Moder (born June 18, 2007).[92]  Religious beliefs [ edit ]  Deployed troops show Roberts the controls of an F-15  In 2010, Roberts disclosed, in an interview for Elle magazine that she believes in and practices Hinduism.[93] Roberts is a devotee of the guru Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji), a picture of whom drew Roberts to Hinduism.[94]  In September 2009, Swami Daram Dev of Ashram Hari Mandir in Pataudi, where Roberts was shooting Eat Pray Love, gave her children new names after Hindu gods: Laxmi for Hazel, Ganesh for Phinnaeus and Krishna Balram for Henry.[95]  Charities [ edit ]  Roberts has given her time and resources to UNICEF as well as to other charitable organizations. On May 10, 1995, Roberts arrived in Port-au-Prince, as she said, ""to educate myself"".[96][97] The poverty she found was overwhelming. ""My heart is just bursting"", she said.[96] UNICEF officials hoped that her six-day visit would trigger an outburst of giving: US$10 million in aid was sought at the time.[96][97]  In 2000, Roberts narrated Silent Angels, a documentary about Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, which was shot in Los Angeles, Baltimore and New York. The documentary was designed to help raise public awareness about the disease. In July 2006, Earth Biofuels announced Roberts as a spokeswoman for the company and as chair of the company's newly formed Advisory Board promoting the use of renewable fuels. She also supports Gucci's ""Chime For Change"" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.[98]  Roberts was the voice of Mother Nature in a 2014 short film for Conservation International, intended to raise awareness about climate change.[99]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  Filmography [ edit ]  References [ edit ]"	1
Chad Michael Murray had never known the cause of death of his late grandmother — until now.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In fact, there were only two people who knew what exactly happened at the time of her death: his grandmother and her husband, his late grandfather, who was accused of her murder.  On Wednesday’s episode of Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry, Murray, 36, finally got some closure about her death.  “There’s this feeling that grandpa would’ve said or verbalized something to people before he died and after he died, his words were changed. He’s like, ‘No, I’m not taking accountability for this. This isn’t right.’ There’s something wrong here with the narrative that’s put after,” Tyler Henry, 22, told the One Tree Hill alum.  “For some reason, they’re having me talk about grandma. They’re having me talk about a fall for some reason. I don’t know what this is,” Henry explained.  “The speculation from the stories that I got from my grandfather was that he was arrested for her murder,” the actor said. “She died at 17 and she just had my mother. She was found with her hands tied behind her back, hung in the basement. So there was a fall, just in a different way.”  “And then after that, he was cleared and they didn’t really have enough evidence to say, ‘It was you that did it.’ ”  RELATED: Why Hollywood Medium‘s Tyler Henry Says Connecting with Michael Jackson Was ‘Really Humbling’  But according to Henry, Murray’s late grandmother died by suicide.  “Before I got here, there was this woman who came through who I acknowledged passing away tragically. But it came through in a way of like, taking accountability to some extent for her actions,” Henry informed the American Drifter author. “But I’m thinking that it might have been even her way of kinda trying to come through and say, ‘Hey, this is something that I’m putting more on myself.’ So, I don’t think he killed your grandmother.”  E!  After speaking with Henry and learning the details about his late grandmother’s death, Murray revealed, “I am, without a doubt, a believer,” adding, “He’s pretty damn good at it.”  Hollywood Medium airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on E!

When I first walked into the Astros’ offices, which are located in the shell of Houston’s old Union Station abutting Minute Maid Park, on the morning of June 4, 2014, the club was still the laughingstock of baseball. Since the start of the 2011 season, the Astros had lost nearly twice as many games, 358, as they had won, 187. Worse, they were run by executives who were still viewed as know-it-all baseball outsiders—like the G.M., former management consultant Jeff Luhnow, and the so-called Director of Decision Sciences, the former NASA engineer Sig Mejdal—even though the men had at that point worked within the game for a decade. Worst of all, Luhnow and his execs were openly violating the baseball compact by which rebuilding teams were supposed to obscure their long-term plan by maintaining the illusion that they were genuinely trying to win each and every year, even if it meant losing just a little less.  “When you’re in 2017, you don’t really care that much about whether you lost 98 or 107 in 2012,” Luhnow said back then. “You care about how close we are to winning a championship in 2017.” In other words, they were entirely focused on several years down the line, which meant shedding every one of their expensive assets and starting from scratch. People hated it.  Still, a few days later I flew back to New York with the makings of a 5,000-word story that would appear in the June 24 issue Sports Illustrated, with a bold cover line: YOUR 2017 WORLD SERIES CHAMPS featuring the sorry Astros. SI’s editor Chris Stone and I, along with baseball editor Emma Span, had consulted on the proper year to choose. We settled on 2017 because the Astros’ young nucleus would by then be reaching its prime, because it seemed to more or less hew to the front office’s own timeline—which, they promised, would eventually include a payroll hike—and because three years, in baseball, is actually not the blink of an eye.  But many people, including some within our own office, hated the cover, too. Even the club’s own hometown paper, the Houston Chronicle, called it “more of an attention-grabbing, perhaps even tongue-in-cheek projection than a prediction.”  It was certainly a long shot, but so is everything in baseball. Vegas usually assigns a given season’s spring favorite less than a 20% chance of winning that fall’s World Series. What it wasn’t was empty clickbait, or a hot take. While we’re never above generating interesting conversations, my editors and I genuinely believed that what I saw down in Houston could result in a ring in three seasons. Now, the Astros are four games away from coming through on that prediction.  Of course, immediately after the issue reached mailboxes and newsstands, the Astros seemed to draw further away from the meeting the deadline we’d publicly set for them, in ways I described last month in an SI feature which focused on their recent last second trade for Justin Verlander. The 2015 Rookie of the Year, shortstop Carlos Correa, spent the second half of the season on the bench with a broken leg. George Springer, who had appeared on the cover, hit the DL. Their proprietary database, Ground Control, was revealed to have been hacked—by, it turned out, the former Cardinals scouting director Chris Correa, a former coworker of Luhnow’s and of several other Houston executives when they were all with St. Louis. (Correa—who, court documents suggested, was driven to increase his hacking efforts out of jealousy spurred by the SI cover, is now serving a 46-month prison sentence for unauthorized access of a protected computer.) Luhnow failed to sign the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, high school lefthander Brady Aiken, after the club detected an issue with Aiken’s elbow and decreased its offer to him. One of the Astros’ minor league stadiums flooded, and another caught on fire.  There were other mishaps and missteps along the way. “If we ever catch ourselves feeling smart, all we have to do is turn on SportsCenter,” Mejdal told me. There, as often as not, they could catch J.D. Martinez hitting another home run—the same J.D. Martinez whom Houston cut outright in March 2014, and who since then has an OPS (.936) higher than all but six other hitters in the majors. If Martinez wasn’t homering that night, then Kris Bryant probably was, the same Kris Bryant on whom the Astros passed with the top overall pick in 2013, in favor of the polished college pitcher Mark Appel. Appel had a 5.60 ERA in Triple-A this season—in the Phillies organization, where he was traded in December of 2015. Bryant, whom the Cubs picked No. 2 in `13, is the reigning NL MVP.  The Astros, though, never claimed to own a crystal ball, or that they would never make a mistake. They always expected to make many of them. Their goal was to make marginally more correct decisions than their competitors, in the long haul, and to do so they implemented an analytically rigorous system that not only processed all of the bleeding edge metrics they could find or create, but also heavily incorporated data from old fashioned sources: scouts, who could see things about a player’s potential and character that numbers couldn’t.  Many of those decisions have now paid off. Such as surprising baseball by drafting Correa—Carlos, not Chris—with the top pick in 2012, a move heavily endorsed by current assistant G.M. Mike Elias and one which not only gave them a star shortstop but also the financial room to choose starter Lance McCullers 41st overall. In McCullers’ most recent appearance, he shut out the Yankees over the final four innings of Game 7 of the ALCS. And declining to sign Aiken—who would indeed blow out his elbow nine months after the draft—and thus receiving a compensatory pick that they would use the next year on third baseman Alex Bregman, who has emerged as the star of the 2015 draft and was last seen making the pivotal and most risky defensive play of Game 7, nailing Greg Bird at home to keep the Yankees scoreless.  How about trading for Verlander, even though their metrics didn’t at all favor sacrificing three promising prospects for a 34-year-old with a contract guaranteeing him $28 million a year? It’s virtually impossible to imagine them making the World Series without the ALCS MVP. Or signing expensive free agents this past winter, like Carlos Beltran (one year, $16 million), Charlie Morton (two years, $14 million) and Josh Reddick (four years, $52 million)? Or hanging on to selected young players they’d inherited from the previous front office, particularly Springer, Jose Altuve and Dallas Keuchel?  Luck played its role, too—but the Astros’ plan, and the extended timeframe for their rebuilding effort permitted by owner Jim Crane, allowed room for good fortune. In the first season after Luhnow and his crew took over, 2012, Keuchel was a clean-shaven 24-year-old rookie who walked more batters (39) than he struck out (38), and Altuve was an undersized slap-hitter with nine career home runs. The front office had no idea that Keuchel would develop a devastating breaking ball and a more athletic delivery, as well as extraordinary facial hair, to become a Cy Young winner, or that Altuve, though still undersized, would develop into a power hitting, probable MVP. What they had was time to allow unexpected things like that to happen, as well as the analytical horsepower to expose players to every conceivable pathway by which they might improve.  Now they’re on the cusp of doing a few of the most unexpected thing of all: no, not making it seem as if we at Sports Illustrated know what we’re talking about—though, thanks for that—but winning the World Series just three years after completing their sixth straight losing season.  They’re still the underdog. Of eight SI baseball staffers who on Monday predicted the World Series’ outcome, just one picked the Astros to beat the Dodgers, and you can probably guess who that was without clicking that link. But even if they don’t do it this year, they are a team built to win in the long haul, as was always the plan. Just four members of the World Series roster—DH Carlos Beltran, outfielder Cameron Maybin and relievers Luke Gregerson and Francisco Liriano—will be free agents after the season, and none of them is nearly as vital as, say, Altuve, Correa, Keuchel, Springer or Verlander. And, with a payroll that still ranks around the league average of $150 million—an increase from a last-place $36 million just four years ago—they will have the wherewithal to spend more, too.  The most remarkable thing of all about the Astros is this: they told everyone exactly what they were going to do—and then they did it. That sort of confidence might not make them beloved within certain baseball circles. But whether they win or lose in the next nine days, it’s now impossible to doubt that they’ve been on to something all along.	0

""I’m fanatical about sports and have looked at loads of books and websites on exercise during pregnancy but have been disappointed by the limited technical information on what you can and can’t do. I found that particularly so during the riskier first trimester. And this being my first pregnancy, I had so many questions I felt were all unanswered.""  Pippa wrote that she kept the news private when she first learned of her pregnancy and that unlike her sister Kate, she hasn't suffered from severe morning sickness. ""I was lucky to pass the 12-week [mark] without suffering from morning sickness,"" she wrote. ""That meant I was able to carry on as normal and continue most of my sports with better knowledge and, more importantly, professionals to learn from.""  ""I’ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it’s being strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth, and recovery,"" she added. Pippa will continue to write about her pregnancy experience for Waitrose Weekly, she ended her column.

"It’s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.  Though the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other’s lives, co-parenting their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 — together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.  Then on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.  “Ben’s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,” a source told ET. “He continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.”  Since their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.  Here’s everything she’s said about Affleck since their split:  July 2018  Garner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, “Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really — I could cry talking about it.”  She added, “What I think I’ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, ‘cause you think that’ll end the, ‘Are they engaged? Are they not?’ And that’s true in reverse, as well. If you are — if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there’s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, ‘Oh, you’ve had to go through this in public.’ The public isn’t what’s hard. What’s hard is going through it.”  June 2018  For Father’s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, “Our kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.”  November 2017  In an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, “I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”  May 2017  After People magazine released a cover story about Garner’s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.  “This isn’t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom’s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,"" she said. ""I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it’s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete.”  October 2016  Garner spoke with ET’s Denny Directo at the Save the Children Illumination Gala about how she and Affleck have chosen to raise their kids.  “It’s so important that you model for your kids how to be a citizen of the world, and I think that’s the best thing you can do,” she told ET, adding that she and Affleck each have special causes that they try to teach their kids about.  “That’s really important at home, to make sure that our kids know that we both have causes that we care so much about… that we dedicate time, resources, and our energy toward making our own little slice of the world a little bit better,” she said.  August 2016  'We are definitely a modern family': #JenniferGarner talks to @nmoralesnbc about family and marriage https://t.co/jJpZAE5BoG — TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 4, 2016  Garner was praised on the Today show for putting her kids first while dealing with the end of her marriage.  “It has to be,” she said. ""You don’t have a choice. It has to be.”  Calling their family unit “definitely a modern family,” she added, “We’re doing really well.”  She also opened up about her decision to take her kids to London for the filming of Justice League, in which Affleck played Batman.  “Ben was working on Justice League, and I thought, ‘Well, the kids should have that experience,'” she explained. “He and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.”"	1
"Springsteen redirects here. For other uses, see Springsteen (disambiguation)  Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter and musician, known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed ""The Boss"", he is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, his Jersey Shore roots, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and energetic stage performances.  Springsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984) find pleasures in the struggles of daily American life. He has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time.[1][2] He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, a Tony Award (for Springsteen on Broadway) as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999. In 2009, Springsteen was a Kennedy Center Honors recipient, in 2013 was named MusiCares person of the year, and in 2016 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[3]  Springsteen married Patti Scialfa in 1991. Their three children are Evan James Springsteen, Jessica Rae Springsteen, and Sam Ryan Springsteen.  Early life [ edit ]  Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey.[4] He was brought home from the hospital to Freehold Borough where he spent his childhood. He lived on South Street and attended Freehold Borough High School. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was of Dutch and Irish ancestry, and worked as a bus driver, among other vocations, but was unemployed most of the time. Springsteen said his mother, Adele Ann (née Zerilli), a legal secretary and of Italian ancestry, was the main breadwinner.[5][6] His maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense, a town near Naples.[7] He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. Pamela had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full-time; she took photos for his Human Touch, Lucky Town and The Ghost of Tom Joad albums.  Springsteen's last name is topographic and of Dutch origin, literally translating to ""jumping stone"" but more generally meaning a kind of stone used as a stepping stone in unpaved streets or between two houses.[8] The Springsteens are among the early Dutch families who settled in the colony of New Netherland in the 1600s.  Raised a Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with the nuns and rejected the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his later music reflects a Catholic ethos and includes a few rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns.[9] In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than political ideology that most influenced his music. He noted in the interview that his faith had given him a ""very active spiritual life"", although he joked that this ""made it very difficult sexually."" He added: ""Once a Catholic, always a Catholic.""[10]  In ninth grade, Springsteen began attending the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. Former teachers have said he was a ""loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar."" He graduated in 1967, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped the ceremony.[11] He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out.[9]  Career [ edit ]  1964–1972: Early years [ edit ]  This was different, shifted the lay of the land. Four guys, playing and singing, writing their own material ... Rock 'n' roll came to my house where there seemed to be no way out ... and opened up a whole world of possibilities. —Bruce Springsteen, on the impact of The Beatles[12]  Springsteen grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer Frank Sinatra on the radio. He became interested in being involved in music himself when, in 1956 and 1957, at the age of seven, he saw Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. Soon after this his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl's Music in Freehold for $6 a week but it failed to provide him with the 'instant gratification' he desired.[13] In 1964, Springsteen saw the three Beatles appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and, inspired, he bought his first guitar for $18.95 at the Western Auto Appliance Store.[14][12] Thereafter he started playing for audiences with a band called the Rogues at local venues such as the Elks Lodge in Freehold. In late 1964, Springsteen's mother took out a loan to buy her 16-year-old son a $60 Kent guitar, an act he subsequently memorialized in his song ""The Wish"". The following year, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles. His first gig with the Castiles was possibly at a trailer park on New Jersey Route 34. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big.[15][16]  Called for conscription in the United States Armed Forces when he was 18, Springsteen failed the physical examination and did not serve in the Vietnam War. He had suffered a concussion in a motorcycle accident when he was 17, and this together with his ""crazy"" behavior at induction gave him a classification of 4F, which made him unacceptable for service.[17]  In the late-1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a power trio known as Earth, playing in clubs in New Jersey, with one major show at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City. Earth consisted of John Graham on bass, and Mike Burke on drums. Bob Alfano was later added on organ, but was replaced for two gigs by Frank 'Flash' Craig.[15]  Ordinary life in New Jersey beach towns such as Asbury Park are the background to Springsteen's early lyrics  From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with Steel Mill (originally called Child), which included Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, Vinnie Roslin and later Steve Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. During this time he performed regularly at venues on the Jersey Shore, in Richmond, Virginia,[18] Nashville, Tennessee, and a set of gigs in California,[15] quickly gathering a cult following. San Francisco Examiner music critic Philip Elwood gave Springsteen credibility in his glowing assessment of Steel Mill: ""I have never been so overwhelmed by totally unknown talent."" Elwood went on to praise their ""cohesive musicality"" and, in particular, singled out Springsteen as ""a most impressive composer"".  Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style: Dr. Zoom & the Sonic Boom (early- to mid-1971), the Sundance Blues Band (mid-1971), and the Bruce Springsteen Band (mid-1971 to mid-1972). With the addition of pianist David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horn sections, the Zoomettes (a group of female backing vocalists for Dr. Zoom) and Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&B, jazz, church music, early rock 'n' roll, and soul, with major influences being Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Leon Russell and Van Morrison.[15]  Springsteen acquired the nickname ""The Boss"" during this period; when he played club gigs with a band he took on the task of collecting the band's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.[19] The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of Monopoly that Springsteen would play with other Jersey Shore musicians.[20] Springsteen is not fond of this nickname, due to his dislike of bosses,[19] but seems to have since tacitly accepted it. Previously he had the nickname ""Doctor"".[21][22]  His prolific songwriting ability (with ""more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums"", as his future record label would describe it in early publicity campaigns) brought his skills to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: New managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, who in turn brought him to the attention of Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond. Hammond auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.  Even after Springsteen gained international acclaim, his New Jersey roots showed through in his music, and he often praised ""the great state of New Jersey"" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he has routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York venues. He has also made many surprise appearances at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years.  1972–1974: Initial struggle for success [ edit ]  Springsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by Clive Davis, after having initially piqued the interest of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label a decade earlier. Despite the expectations of Columbia Records' executives that Springsteen would record an acoustic album, he brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named for several months). His debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite[23] though sales were slow.  Because of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like ""Blinded by the Light""[note 1] and ""For You"", as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. ""He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone'"" wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen's first interview/profile in March 1973. Photographs for that original profile were taken by Ed Gallucci.[24][25] Crawdaddy discovered Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Knobler profiled him in Crawdaddy three times, in 1973, 1975 and 1978.[26] (Springsteen and the E Street Band acknowledged the magazine's support by giving a private performance at the Crawdaddy 10th Anniversary Party in New York City in June 1976.)[27] Music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem in 1975 that when Springsteen's first album was released ""... many of us dismissed it: he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison's"".[28] The track ""Spirit in the Night"" especially showed Morrison's influence, while ""Lost in the Flood"" was the first of many portraits of Vietnam veterans, and ""Growin' Up"", his first take on the recurring theme of adolescence.  In September 1973, Springsteen's second album The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more R&B vibe, and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"" and ""Incident on 57th Street"" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing ""Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"" continues to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.  In the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston's The Real Paper music critic Jon Landau wrote, after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, ""I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time.""[29] Landau helped to finish the epic new album Born to Run and subsequently became Springsteen's manager and producer. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a ""Wall of Sound"" production. But fed by the release of an early mix of ""Born to Run"" to nearly a dozen radio stations, anticipation built toward the album's release.[30]  The album took more than 14 months to record, with six months spent on the song ""Born to Run"". During this time, Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard ""sounds in [his] head"" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during these recording sessions that ""Miami"" Steve Van Zandt would stumble into the studio just in time to help Springsteen organize the horn section on ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"". Van Zandt, who would eventually join the E Street Band, had been a longtime friend of Springsteen, as well as a collaborator on earlier musical projects, and understood where he was coming from, which helped him to translate some of the sounds Springsteen was hearing. Still, by the end of the grueling recording sessions Springsteen was not satisfied, and upon first hearing the finished album, threw it into the alley and told Jon Landau he would rather just cut it live at The Bottom Line (a place he often played).[31]  1975–1983: Breakthrough [ edit ]  On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York's The Bottom Line club. This attracted major media attention and was broadcast live on WNEW-FM. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.)[32] Oklahoma City rock radio station WKY, in association with Carson Attractions, staged an experimental promotional event that resulted in a sold out house at the (6,000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall. With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and while reception at US top 40 radio outlets for the album's two singles was not overwhelming (""Born to Run"" reached a modest No. 23 on the Billboard charts, and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" peaked at No. 83), almost every track on the album received album-oriented rock airplay, especially ""Born to Run"", ""Thunder Road"", ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"" and ""Jungleland"", all of which remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations.  Springsteen appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that he eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a concert appearance in London.  Springsteen and the E Street Band, 1977  A legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, Springsteen's new songs sounded more somber than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen's career. Gone were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters, and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and length of its shows.[33]  By the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a US No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of Greetings' ""Blinded by the Light"" in early 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her take on Springsteen's unreleased ""Because the Night"" (with revised lyrics by Smith) in 1978, while The Pointer Sisters hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's also unreleased ""Fire"". Although not a critical success, long time friend Southside Johnny recorded Springsteen's ""The Fever"" in early 1976 and ""Talk to Me"" in 1978. The two of them along with Steve Van Zandt collaborated to produce ""Trapped Again"" in 1978.  In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album, as well as the following summer's No Nukes documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.  Springsteen continued to focus on working-class life with the 20-song double album The River in 1980, which included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads, and finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, ""Hungry Heart"". Like the previous two albums, musical styles on The River were derived largely from rock 'n' roll music of the 50s and 60s, but with a more explicit pop-rock sound than earlier albums. This is apparent in the adoption of Eighties pop-rock hallmarks like the reverberating-tenor drums, very basic percussion/guitar and repetitive lyrics apparent in many of the tracks. The title song pointed to Springsteen's intellectual direction, while a couple of the lesser-known tracks presaged his musical direction. The album sold well, becoming his first No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and a long tour in 1980 and 1981 followed, which included Springsteen's first extended tour of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U.S.  The River was followed in 1982 by the stark solo acoustic Nebraska. Recording sessions had been held to expand on a demo tape Springsteen had made at his home on a simple, low-tech four-track tape deck. However, during the recording process Springsteen and producer Jon Landau realized the songs worked better as solo acoustic numbers than full band renditions and the original demo tape was released as the album. Although the recordings of the E Street Band were shelved, other songs from these sessions would later be released, including ""Born in the U.S.A"" and ""Glory Days"". According to the Marsh biographies, Springsteen was depressed when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. While Nebraska did not sell as well as Springsteen's three previous albums, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named ""Album of the Year"" by Rolling Stone magazine's critics) and influenced later works by other major artists, including U2's album The Joshua Tree. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with Nebraska's release.  1984–1991: Commercial and popular phenomenon [ edit ]  Springsteen is probably best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S., 30 million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the Top 10. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics—except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways.[34] The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.[35]  The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. In 1984, conservative columnist George Will attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen's work ethic. Six days after the column was printed, in a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey, Reagan said, ""America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen."" Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, ""Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one."" He then began playing ""Johnny 99"", with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.[36]  Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by the Chrysler Corporation to use ""Born in the U.S.A."" in a car commercial. In later years, to eliminate the bombast and make the song's original meaning more explicitly clear, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only by acoustic guitar, thus returning to how the song was originally conceived. The original acoustic version of the song, recorded in 1982 during the Nebraska sessions, appeared on the 1998 archival release Tracks.  ""Dancing in the Dark"" was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U.S.A., peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The video for the song showed a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress's career. The song ""Cover Me"" was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer, but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, ""Protection"". Videos for the album were directed by Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen played on the ""We Are the World"" song and album in 1985. His live single ""Trapped"" from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.[37]  During the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen met actress Julianne Phillips, whom he would marry in 1985. He also that year took part in the recording of the USA For Africa charity song ""We Are The World""; however he declined to play at Live Aid. He later stated that he ""simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be"". He has since expressed regret at turning down Bob Geldof's invitation, stating that he could have played a couple of acoustic songs had there been no slot available for a full band performance.  The Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of Arthur Baker's dance mixes of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the UK Albums Chart: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.[38]  Live/1975–85, a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. Live/1975–85 summed up Springsteen's career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen's difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long coda to ""Racing in the Street"". Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album's song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and trading among fans.  During the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including Backstreets magazine, which started in Seattle and continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website.  After this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love album (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his marriage to Julianne Phillips and described some of his unhappiness in the relationship. Reflecting the challenges of love in ""Brilliant Disguise"", Springsteen sang:  So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes/Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?  The subsequent Tunnel of Love Express Tour shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements. During the European leg in 1988, Springsteen's relationship with backup singer Patti Scialfa became public. Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988.[39]  Springsteen performing on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour at the Radrennbahn Weißensee in East Berlin on July 19, 1988  On July 19, 1988, Springsteen held a concert in East Germany that attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum has called the concert ""the most important rock concert ever, anywhere"", in his 2013 book Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. It had been conceived by the Socialist Unity Party's youth wing in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in the DDR, and helped contribute to the fall of the Berlin Wall the following year.[40]  Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In late 1989 he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California, marrying in 1991.  1992–1998: Artistic and commercial ups and downs and soundtrack work [ edit ]  In 1992, after risking fan accusations of ""going Hollywood"" by moving to Los Angeles and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were even more introspective than any of his previous work and displayed a newly revealed confidence. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself.  An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program (later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:  I've gotta thank him because—what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs—and I tried it in the early '90s and it didn't work; the public didn't like it.[41]  A multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song ""Streets of Philadelphia"", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the ""Brilliant Disguise"" video.  In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), and also one show at Tramps in New York City,[42] he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad, inspired by John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and by Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass, a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. This was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet and not to clap during the performances.  In April 1996, Springsteen gave an interview to LGBT magazine The Advocate writer Judy Wieder, in which he spoke of the importance of fighting for gay marriage. ""You get your license, you do all the social rituals. It's part of your place in society, and in some way part of society's acceptance of you.""[43]  Following the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family.[44] In 1998, he released the sprawling, four-disc box set of outtakes, Tracks. Later, he would acknowledge that the 1990s were a ""lost period"" for him: ""I didn't do a lot of work. Some people would say I didn't do my best work.""[45]  1999–2007: Return to success [ edit ]  Springsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by Bono (the lead singer of U2), a favor he returned in 2005.[46]  In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden, which ended the tour. The final two shows were recorded for HBO, with corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City. A new song, ""American Skin (41 Shots)"", about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, which was played at these shows proved controversial.  In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. (Many of the songs were influenced by phone conversations Springsteen had with family members of victims of the attacks who in their obituaries had mentioned how his music touched their lives.) The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show, The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S. because of his vocal endorsement of leftist, liberal politics. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close.[47] During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Springsteen-oriented online communities had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour concluded with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy over ""American Skin"" and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan.  During the early 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations, and causes. These shows were explicitly intended for the devoted fans, including numbers such as the E Street Shuffle outtake ""Thundercrack"", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song ""My City of Ruins"" was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon broadcast, he selected ""My City of Ruins"", which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the broadcast, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to ""Rise up!"" The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close The Rising album and as an encore on the subsequent tour.  At the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash's ""London Calling"" along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt and No Doubt's bassist, Tony Kanal, in tribute to Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and the triple Sandinista!.  In 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band participated in the Vote for Change tour, along with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, the Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in swing states, to benefit the progressive political organization group America Coming Together and to encourage people to register and vote. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed —against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, Amnesty International, and the Christic Institute—he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan ""Born in the U.S.A."" flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen's ""No Surrender"" became the main campaign theme song for John Kerry's unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies.  Devils & Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, with a few having been performed then but not released.[48] The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen's anti-corporate politics. The album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo Devils & Dust Tour at the same time as the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, ukulele, banjo, electric guitar, and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar, and percussion were also used for some songs.)  In November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station called E Street Radio. This channel played commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews, and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.  In April 2006, Springsteen released We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. A tour began the same month, with the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed The Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to The Sessions Band). Seeger Sessions material was emphasized, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews,[49] but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.[50][51][52] By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.  Springsteen's next album, titled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it had 10 new Springsteen songs plus ""Long Walk Home"", performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), ""Terry's Song"", a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died on July 30, 2007.[53] Magic debuted at No. 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the Irish charts at No. 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in Norway again. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted E Street Radio on September 27, 2007, in anticipation of Magic.[54] Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications was alleged to have sent an edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material. However, Clear Channel Adult Alternative (or ""AAA"") station KBCO did play tracks from the album, undermining the allegations of a corporate blackout.[55]  The Springsteen and E Street Band Magic Tour began at the Hartford Civic Center with the album's release and continued through North America and Europe.  It was announced on November 21, 2007, that Springsteen's longtime friend and founding E Street Band member, Danny Federici, would be taking a leave of absence from the Magic Tour to pursue treatment for melanoma. Charles Giordano filled in as Federici's replacement.  2008–2011: Deaths of Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons [ edit ]  Federici returned to the stage on March 20, 2008, when he appeared for portions of a Springsteen and E Street Band performance at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Less than one month later, on April 17, 2008, Federici died at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, having suffered for three years from melanoma.[56][57]  On January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for ""The Wrestler"", from the Darren Aronofsky film by the same name.[58] After receiving a heartfelt letter from lead actor Mickey Rourke, Springsteen supplied the song for the film for free.[59]  Springsteen performed at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009,[60] agreeing to do it after many previous offers.[61] A few days before the game, Springsteen gave a rare press conference at which he promised a ""twelve-minute party.""[62][63] His 12-minute 45-second set, with the E Street Band and the Miami Horns, included abbreviated renditions of ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"""", ""Born to Run"", ""Working on a Dream"", and ""Glory Days"", the latter complete with football references in place of the original baseball-themed lyrics. The set of appearances and promotional activities led Springsteen to say, ""This has probably been the busiest month of my life.""[64]  Springsteen supported Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, announcing his endorsement in April 2008[65] and going on to appear at several Obama rallies as well as performing several solo acoustic performances in support of Obama's campaign throughout 2008,[66] culminating with a November 2 rally at which he debuted the song ""Working on a Dream"" in a duet with Scialfa.[67] At an Ohio rally, Springsteen discussed the importance of ""truth, transparency and integrity in government, the right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise and the sanctity of home...""[68]  Following Obama's electoral victory on November 4, Springsteen's song ""The Rising"" was the first song played over the loudspeakers after Obama's victory speech in Chicago's Grant Park. Springsteen was the musical opener for the Obama Inaugural Celebration on January 18, 2009, which was attended by over 400,000 people.[69] He performed ""The Rising"" with an all-female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie's ""This Land Is Your Land"" with Pete Seeger.  Springsteen's Working on a Dream album, dedicated to the memory of Danny Federici, was released in late January 2009[62] and the supporting Working on a Dream Tour ran from April 2009 until November 2009. The tour presented few songs from the new album, with set lists dominated instead by classics and selections reflecting the ongoing late-2000s recession.[70] Springsteen also played songs requested by audience members holding up signs, a practice begun during the final stages of the Magic Tour.[70] Drummer Max Weinberg was replaced for some shows by his 18-year-old son Jay Weinberg, so that the former could serve his role as bandleader on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.[70] During this tour, Springsteen and the band made their first real foray in the world of music festivals, headlining nights at the Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands, Festival des Vieilles Charrues in France, the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the United States and the Glastonbury Festival[71] and Hard Rock Calling in the UK.[72] Several shows on the tour presented Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, or Born in the U.S.A. in its entirety.[73] The band performed five final shows at Giants Stadium, opening with a new song highlighting the historic stadium, and Springsteen's Jersey roots, named ""Wrecking Ball"".[74] A DVD from the Working on a Dream Tour entitled London Calling: Live in Hyde Park was released in 2010.  Fireworks go off at the conclusion of the ""E! Street! Band!"" exhortation during the final shows at Giants Stadium  Springsteen was among the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual award to figures from the world of arts for their contribution to American culture, on December 6, 2009.[75] President Obama gave a speech in which he talked about how Springsteen had incorporated the life of regular Americans in his expansive palette of songs and how his concerts were beyond typical rock-and-roll concerts, how, apart from being high-energy concerts, they were ""communions"". He ended the remark ""while I am the president, he is the Boss"". Tributes were paid by several well-known celebrities including Jon Stewart (who described Springsteen's ""unprecedented combination of lyrical eloquence, musical mastery and sheer unbridled, unadulterated joy""). A musical tribute included John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Jennifer Nettles, Melissa Etheridge, Eddie Vedder, and Sting.  Springsteen was among a host of musicians who voiced extensive criticism regarding the merging of Ticketmaster with Live Nation, saying ""the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing.""[76]  The 2000s ended with Springsteen named one of eight Artists of the Decade by Rolling Stone magazine[77] and with Springsteen's tours ranking him fourth among artists in total concert grosses for the decade.[78] His 2010 tour included venues in the UK and Ireland.  In September 2010, a documentary about the making of Springsteen's 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film, The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, was included in a box set reissue of the album, entitled The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story, released in November 2010. Also airing on HBO, the documentary explored Springsteen's making of the album and his role in the production and development of the tracks.  Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band's saxophonist and founding member, died on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke. ""Clarence lived a wonderful life"", Springsteen said. ""He carried within him a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage.""[79]  2012–2015: Wrecking Ball, High Hopes, American Beauty and The Ties That Bind box set [ edit ]  Springsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. The album consists of eleven tracks plus two bonus tracks. Three songs previously only available as live versions—""Wrecking Ball"", ""Land of Hope and Dreams"", and ""American Land""—appear on the album.[80] Wrecking Ball became Springsteen's tenth No. 1 album in the United States, tying him with Elvis Presley for third most No. 1 albums of all-time. Only The Beatles (19) and Jay Z (12) have more No. 1 albums.[81]  Following the release of the album, Springsteen and the E Street Band announced plans for the Wrecking Ball Tour, which began on March 18, 2012. As tickets for the first U.S. dates went on sale, many fans were unable to obtain tickets, much like for the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour, allegedly due to ticket scalpers. Shows sold out within minutes and many tickets appeared, at much higher prices, on resale websites such as StubHub less than an hour after the onsale time. Ticketmaster said web traffic was 2.5 times the highest level of the past year during the online sales and suggested that scalpers played a big role. On July 31, 2012, in Helsinki, Finland, Springsteen performed his longest concert ever at 4 hours and 6 minutes and 33 songs. Not included in this total time is a thirty-minute, five-song, solo acoustical set he did about two hours before the show.[82]  Springsteen was honored with the 2013 MusiCares Person of the Year award in recognition of his creative accomplishments as well as his charitable work and philanthropic activities. A ceremony was held on February 8, 2013, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, two days before the Grammy Awards.[83]  Despite saying he would sit out the 2012 presidential election, Springsteen campaigned for President Barack Obama's re-election in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Wisconsin. At the rallies, he briefly spoke to the audience and performed a short acoustic set that included a newly written song titled ""Forward"".[84][85][86] Obama also used ""We Take Care of Our Own"" as one of his top campaign songs. Use of the song helped boost sales of the song by 409%.[87]  On October 29, 2012, the New Jersey area was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Two days later, Springsteen dedicated his performance at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, New York, to those affected by the storm and those helping to recover. Springsteen and the E Street Band performed ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" at a one-hour televised telethon called Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together on November 2, 2012, which aired on NBC and at the same time many other channels. Springsteen also joined Billy Joel, Steven Tyler and Jimmy Fallon for a performance of ""Under the Boardwalk"". All money was donated to the American Red Cross.[88] Springsteen and the E Street Band, along with many top names in the music industry, performed at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 2012, for 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief.  At year's end, the Wrecking Ball Tour was named Top Draw for having the top attendance out of any tour by the Billboard Touring Awards. The tour finished second to Roger Waters, who had the top grossing tour of 2012.[89] Springsteen finished second only to Madonna as the top money maker of 2012 with $33.44 million.[90] The Wrecking Ball album, along with the single ""We Take Care of Our Own"", was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song for ""We Take Care of Our Own"" and Best Rock Album.[91][92] Rolling Stone named Wrecking Ball the number one album of 2012 on their Top 50 albums of 2012 list.[93]  In March 2013, and for the first time since re-uniting with Springsteen in 1999, Steven Van Zandt was forced to miss the Australian leg of the band's tour due to acting commitments on his television show Lilyhammer. He was replaced by guitarist Tom Morello for the leg.[94]  In late July 2013, the documentary Springsteen & I, directed by Baillie Walsh and produced by Ridley Scott, was released simultaneously via a worldwide cinema broadcast in over 50 countries and in over 2000 movie theaters.[95]  The Wrecking Ball Tour, which came to an end in September 2013, was one of Springsteen's most successful. A week after it ended, Springsteen announced a 2014 tour that would include dates in Australia and New Zealand.[96]  Springsteen, along with friend and mentor Pete Seeger, as well as Herbie Hancock, Sally Field and Robert De Niro, was among a total of 198 class of 2013 inductees into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The induction ceremony was held at the Academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts in October 2013.  In October 2013, Springsteen posted a letter on his website thanking fans of all ages for their support throughout the Wrecking Ball World Tour. A highlight video of the tour was also released showing a new studio recording of the Suicide song, ""Dream Baby Dream"".[97]  Springsteen released his eighteenth studio album, High Hopes, on January 14, 2014. The first single and video were of a newly recorded version of the song ""High Hopes"", which Springsteen had previously recorded in 1995. The album was the first by Springsteen in which all songs are either cover songs, newly recorded outtakes from previous records, or newly recorded versions of songs previously released. The 2014 E Street Band touring lineup, along with deceased E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, appears on the album along with guitarist Tom Morello.[98]  It was announced on January 15, 2014 that Springsteen would start making professional recordings of all of his live shows available following each performance on his upcoming tour via download to a special USB wristband.[99] In addition to the wristbands, shows will also be offered through Springsteen's website until June 30, 2014.[100] Springsteen along with the E Street Band and guitarist Tom Morello, kicked off the High Hopes Tour on January 26, 2014. The tour was considered to be a continuation of the Wrecking Ball Tour.  High Hopes became Springsteen's eleventh No. 1 album in the US.[101] It was his tenth No. 1 in the UK, tying him for fifth all-time The Rolling Stones and U2.[102] On April 4, 2014, HBO aired Bruce Springsteen's High Hopes a 30-minute documentary on the recording of High Hopes.[103] Rolling Stone named High Hopes the second best album of the year (behind only U2's Songs of Innocence) on their Top 50 Albums of 2014 list.[104]  Announced as inductees in December 2013, Springsteen inducted past and present members of the E Street Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, with each member giving a speech and Springsteen and the band performing a three-song set of ""The E Street Shuffle"", ""The River"" and ""Kitty's Back"".[105]  American Beauty, a limited edition four-song EP on 12-inch vinyl released exclusively for Record Store Day on April 18, 2014 contains four unreleased songs from the High Hopes sessions.[106] A music video for the title track was also released. After 34 shows and 182 songs performed, the High Hopes Tour came to an end on May 18, 2014. Springsteen released a short film for the song ""Hunter of Invisible Game"" on July 9, 2014 through his website. It marked Springsteen's directorial debut.[107]  On November 17, 2014, Springsteen released The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-1984, an 8-disc remastered version of his first seven studio albums, some of which had been remastered for the first time.[108]  Springsteen made his acting debut in the final episode of Season 3 of Van Zandt's show Lilyhammer, which was named ""Loose Ends"", after a Springsteen song on his album Tracks. He played Giuseppe Tagliano, the brother of Van Zandt's character, Frank Tagliano aka ""Giovanni ""Johnny"" Henrikssen"". Giuseppe is an undertaker and owner of a funeral parlor who occasionally works as a hitman for a mafia family which Frank is associated.  In November 2014, Springsteen announced that he would be opening the Bruce Springsteen Archives and will release live concerts from throughout his career including many shows which fans consider to be among his most essential performances and that were only previously available through bootlegs. Each show has been completely restored, remixed and remastered for the highest possible sound quality and are available for purchase through digital download or CD at live.brucespringsteen.net, where fans can also buy all of Springsteen's live recordings from the High Hopes Tour.[109]  On August 6, 2015, Springsteen performed ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" and ""Born to Run"" on the final episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, as Stewart's final 'Moment of Zen'. On October 16, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of The River, Springsteen announced The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. Released on December 4, it contains four CDs (including many previously unreleased songs) and three DVDs (or Blu-ray) along with a 148-page coffee table book. In November 2015, ""American Skin (41 Shots)"" was performed with John Legend at Shining a Light: A Concert for Progress on Race in America.  Springsteen made his first appearance on Saturday Night Live since 2002 on December 19, 2015, performing ""Meet Me in the City"", ""The Ties That Bind"", and ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"".[110] On December 4, 2015, he announced details for the upcoming The River Tour 2016 which would begin the following year. Springsteen also discussed plans for a new solo album however plans were put on hold to tour with the E Street Band in support of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection. Springsteen said ""the project I've been working on is more of a solo project. It wasn't a project I was going to probably take the band out on. So I said, 'Gee, that's going to push the band playing again until a ways in the future. It'll be nice to get some playing in so you don't wind up being two or three years between E Street tours.""[111]  2016–present: The River Tour 2016/Summer '17, Chapter and Verse, autobiography and Broadway performances [ edit ]  The River Tour 2016 began in January 2016 in support of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. All first-leg shows in North America included an in-sequence performance of the entire The River album along with other songs from Springsteen's catalog, and all dates were recorded and made available for purchase.[112] More dates were eventually announced expanding the original three-month tour into a seven-month tour with shows in Europe in May 2016 and another North American leg starting in August 2016 and ending the following month. As of July 2016, The River 2016 Tour has been the highest grossing worldwide tour with 1.1 million tickets sold and over $135 million in box office revenue, according to Billboard Boxscore's mid-year report.  In July 2016, Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, discussed Springsteen's upcoming solo album, which is expected for release in 2017, saying ""All I can say is that there is a solo record – and when I say solo record, I'm not talking about an acoustic record. It is, in fact, a very expansive record, a very rich record. It's one of Bruce's very creative efforts. Stay tuned, and we'll see exactly how that shapes up next year."" Landau also said it was too early to know a release day or plans for a supporting tour.[113]  On September 23, 2016, Chapter and Verse, a compilation from throughout Springsteen's career dating back to 1966, was released. Five of the album's eighteen tracks had not been previously released; they include Springsteen's earliest recording from 1966, songs from his tenure in early 1970s bands such as the Castiles, Steel Mill and The Bruce Springsteen Band, along with a track from each studio album of his career.[114] On September 27, 2016, Simon & Schuster published his 500-page autobiography, Born to Run. The book rose quickly to the top of the NY Times Best Sellers List.[115] Springsteen announced he would promote his autobiography with a seventeen date book tour from September to December 2016.[116]  Springsteen receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House from President Barack Obama  Springsteen began the final leg of The River 2016 Tour on August 23, 2016, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey where he performed for 3 hours and 52 minutes making it at the time the longest show he had ever performed in the United States.[117] The record was broken two nights later at MetLife Stadium when Springsteen performed a 3-hour 59-minute show, later topped by his performance of August 30, 2016, at 4 hours and 1 minute which then stood as his longest show in the United States. That record again was topped on September 7, 2016, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Springsteen performed for 4 hours and 4 minutes, which now stands as his longest show in the United States and second-longest ever next to a 2012 show in Helsinki which lasted two minutes longer.[118][119] The tour ended in September 2016; however, dates from January 22, 2017 to February 25, 2017 were added using the same promotional image from The River Tour 2016 although the tour was now renamed the Summer '17 tour.[120] The River 2016 Tour was the top-grossing worldwide tour of 2016; it pulled in $268.3 million globally and was the highest grossing tour since 2014 for any artist topping Taylor Swift's 2015 tour which grossed $250.1 million.[121]  Springsteen supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign by performing an acoustic set of ""Thunder Road"", ""Long Walk Home"" and ""Dancing in the Dark"" at a rally in Philadelphia on November 7, 2016. On November 22, 2016, Springsteen was presented—along with twenty other recipients—the Presidential Medal of Freedom award by Barack Obama.[122] The award is the highest honor for a civilian to receive and is ""presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.""[123] On January 12, 2017, Springsteen along with Patti Scialfa performed a special 15-song acoustic set for President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at the White House's East Room two days before the president gave his farewell address to the nation.[124][125]  Springsteen on Broadway, an eight-week run at the Walter Kerr Theatre on Broadway in New York City in fall 2017, was announced in June 2017[126] and in addition to his music, includes Springsteen reading excerpts from his 2016 autobiography Born to Run and performing other spoken reminiscences written for the show.[127] Originally scheduled to run from October 12 through November 26, the show was extended three times, the last performance now scheduled for December 15, 2018.[128][129][130]  With rumors swirling that Springsteen's solo shows on Broadway could continue well past their current June 2018 end date, on January 18, 2018, Nils Lofgren was asked on Twitter if the E Street Band will ever tour with Bruce again. Lofgren responded saying ""I sure hope so"" however Gary Tallent responded saying that it was ""looking unlikely though"" fueling rumors of the end of the E Street Band.[131][132] The following day, Tallent responded to his original comment saying ""just to be clear, I know as much as you. I like Nils' answer better"".[133] On February 2, 2018, Max Weinberg commented on the future of the E Street Band performing with Springsteen saying ""Don’t worry, we ain’t done yet. The E Street Band will be back out on the road."" [134]  For Springsteen’s production of Springsteen on Broadway, he will be honored with a special award at the upcoming Tony Awards as announced on May 1, 2018.[135]  Musical style [ edit ]  Springsteen (second from right) was among the five recipients of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors  Springsteen draws on many musical influences from the reservoir of traditional American popular music, folk, blues and country. From the beginning, rock and roll has been a dominant influence and Springsteen's musical and lyrical evocations, as well as public tributes, of artists such as Dylan, Presley, The Animals, Roy Orbison, Gary ""U.S."" Bonds, and many others helped to rekindle interest in their music. Springsteen's other preferred musical style is American folk, evident on his debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey, and more strongly on Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad. Springsteen songs such as ""This Hard Land"" demonstrate the lyrical and musical influence of Woody Guthrie.  Elements of Latin American music, jazz, soul, and funk influences can be heard on Springsteen's second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle; the song ""New York City Serenade"" is even reminiscent of the music of George Gershwin. Prominent in these two records is the pianist David Sancious, who left the band shortly into the recording of Springsteen's third album, Born To Run (which also emphasized the piano, played by Roy Bittan).  Subsequently, Springsteen focused more on the rock elements of his music. He initially compressed the sound and developed Darkness on the Edge of Town just as straightforward as concise musical idiom, for the simple riffs, rock guitar solos and clearly recognizable song structures are dominant. His music has been categorized as heartland rock, a style typified by Springsteen, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp. This music has a lyrical reference to the U.S. everyday and the music is kept rather simple and straightforward. This development culminated with Springsteen's hit album Born in the U.S.A., the title song of which has a constantly repeating, fanfare-like keyboard riff and a pounding drum beat. These sounds fit with Springsteen's voice: it cries to the listener the unsentimental story of a disenchanted angry figure. Even songs that can be argued to be album tracks proved to be singles that enjoyed some chart success, such as ""My Hometown"" and ""I'm on Fire"", in which the drum line is formed from subtle hi-hat and rim-clicks-shock (shock at the edge of the snare drum) accompanied by synthesizer and Springsteen's soft guitar line. The album, along with some previous records such as ""Cadillac Ranch"" showed clear rockabilly influences as is evident from his guitar solos, in-fills and vocal styles on these. Another clear influence of early rock n roll on Springsteen's music is evident on the song ""Light of Day"".[citation needed]  In recent years, Springsteen has changed his music further. There are more folk elements up to the gospel to be heard. His last solo album, Devils and Dust, drew rave reviews not only for Springsteen's complex songwriting, but also for his expressive and sensitive singing.  On the album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions Springsteen performed folk classics with a folk band, rather than his usual E Street Band. On his ensuing tour he also interpreted some of his own rock songs in a folk style.  On his 2012 album, Wrecking Ball, Springsteen incorporated a variety of styles, including folk, gospel, and even hip-hop, with a rap in the song ""Rocky Ground"". His studio work with producer Ron Aniello, Wrecking Ball and High Hopes, has also become more experimental, featuring loops and computerized sounds.  Lyrical themes [ edit ]  ""I spent most of my life as a musician measuring the distance between the American Dream and American reality."" —Bruce Springsteen[136][note 2]  Often described as cinematic in their scope, Springsteen's lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment, dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of everyday situations.[137]  It has been recognized that there was a shift in his lyrical approach starting with the album Darkness on the Edge of Town, in which he focused on the emotional struggles of working class life.[138][139]  Personal life [ edit ]  The Springsteen family greets the Obama family on-stage at a rally in Cleveland , Ohio on November 2, 2008.  In the early 1980s, Springsteen met Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony, a bar in New Jersey where local musicians regularly perform. On that particular evening she was performing alongside one of Springsteen's pals, Bobby Bandiera, with whom she had written ""At Least We Got Shoes"" for Southside Johnny. Springsteen liked her voice and after the performance, introduced himself to her. Soon after that, they started spending time together and became friends.[140]  Early in 1984, Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the upcoming Born in the U.S.A. Tour. According to the book Bruce Springsteen on Tour 1969–2005 by Dave Marsh, it looked like Springsteen and Scialfa were on the brink of becoming a couple through the first leg of the tour. But before that could happen, Barry Bell introduced actress/model Julianne Phillips (b.1960) to Springsteen; they were married on May 13, 1985, held shortly after midnight at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church in Lake Oswego, a suburb south of Portland, Oregon.[141][142][143] Opposites in background, the two had an 11-year age difference, and his traveling took its toll on their relationship. His next album, Tunnel of Love, was released in the autumn of 1987 and many of its songs described his unhappiness in the relationship with Phillips.  The Tunnel of Love Express Tour began in late February 1988, and Springsteen convinced Scialfa to join the tour again. She expressed reluctance at first, since she wanted to start recording her first solo album, but after Springsteen told her that the tour would be short, she agreed to postpone her own solo record.[144] Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988, but it wasn't made known to the press. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in love with each other during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started living together soon after his separation from Phillips. Citing irreconcilable differences, Julianne filed for divorce in Los Angeles on August 30, 1988;[145] a settlement was reached in December and it was finalized on March 1, 1989.[146][147]  Springsteen received press criticism for the hastiness in which he and Scialfa took up their relationship. In a 1995 interview with The Advocate, Springsteen told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received. ""It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'"" He also told Wieder that, ""I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, 'Hey, what does it matter?' But it does matter. It's very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly—which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals—is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society's acceptance of you ... Patti and I both found that it did mean something.""[43]  Springsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey, before moving to Los Angeles, where they decided to start a family.[148] On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the couple's first child, Evan James Springsteen.[148][149] On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a very private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends.[148][149] Their second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born on December 30, 1991;[148][149] and their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 1994.[149][150]  When the children reached school-age in the 1990s, Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey specifically to raise a family in a non-paparazzi environment. The grounds of his New Jersey home include a large swimming pool. The family owns and lives on a horse farm in Colts Neck and a home in Rumson; they also own homes in Los Angeles and Wellington, Florida.  Elder son Evan graduated from Boston College; he writes and performs his own songs and won the 2012 Singer/Songwriter Competition held during the Boston College's Arts Festival.[151] Their daughter Jessica is a nationally ranked champion equestrian,[152] and graduated from Duke University. She made her show-jumping debut with the Team USA in August 2014.[153] Their younger son, Sam, is a firefighter.[154]  It has been reported that the press conference regarding the 2009 Super Bowl XLIII half-time show was Springsteen's first press conference in more than 25 years.[155] However, he has appeared in a few radio interviews, most notably on NPR and BBC.[156] 60 Minutes aired one of his last extensive interviews on TV[157] before his tour to support his album, Magic. Springsteen has talked about his mental health struggles.[158]  Springsteen is an activist for LGBT rights and has spoken out many times as a strong supporter of gay marriage. In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: ""I've long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with Governor Corzine when he writes that 'The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is—a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law.'""[159] In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called ""The Four 2012"". Springsteen noted in the ad, ""I couldn't agree more with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now.""[160] In April 2016, Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro, North Carolina days before it was to take place to protest the state's newly passed Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, also referred to as the ""bathroom law"", which dictates which restrooms transgender people are permitted to use and prevents LGBT citizens from suing over human rights violations in the workplace. Springsteen released an official statement on his website. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) celebrated Springsteen's statement and he has received much praise and gratitude from the LGBT community. [161]  Springsteen was out riding his motorcycle on November 11, 2016 when it broke down and he was stranded alongside the road. A group of men from the Freehold American Legion in New Jersey were returning from a Veterans Day event on their motorcycles when they spotted Springsteen and stopped to help. Springsteen hitched a ride on the back of one of the men's motorcycles to a nearby restaurant where the group grabbed a round of drinks, for which Springsteen picked up the tab, while waiting for his ride.[162]  While rejecting religion in his earlier years, Bruce stated in his autobiography Born To Run, he has ""a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe in his power to save, love... but not to damn"". In terms of Catholic faith, he has stated that he ""came to ruefully and bemusedly understand that once you're a Catholic you're always a Catholic"" and ""I don't participate in my religion but I know somewhere... deep inside... I'm still on the team.""[163]  In an interview in 2017 with Tom Hanks, Springsteen admitted to having been a tax evader early in his career.[164]  Bands [ edit ]  Springsteen has been a member of, or has been backed by, several bands during his career, most notably the E Street Band. Earlier bands include the Rogues, the Castiles, Earth, Child, Steel Mill, the Sundance Blues Band, Dr Zoom and the Sonic Boom, and the Bruce Springsteen Band.[165] In October 1972 he formed a new band for the recording of his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which became known as The E Street Band, although the name was not used until September 1974.[166][167] Suki Lahav who was born on a kibbutz in Israel played violin with the E Street band as an unofficial member during live shows in the 1970s.[168]  The E Street Band performed on all of Springsteen's recorded works from his debut until 1982's Nebraska, a solo album on which Springsteen himself played all the instruments. The full band returned for the next album Born in the USA, but from 1988 to 1999, albums were recorded with session musicians. The E Street Band briefly reunited in 1995 for new contributions to the Greatest Hits compilation, and on a more permanent basis from 1999, since which time they have recorded more albums and performed a number of high-profile tours. The 2005 album Devils & Dust was largely a solo recording, with some contribution from session musicians and the 2006 folk rock We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions album was recorded and toured with another band, known as The Sessions Band.

Video footage emerged just yesterday of Kendall kissing Anwar while at the CDFA Awards after-party, which not only made us applaud her efforts, but also kind of creeped us out since they're semi-related.  But each to their own.  The one thing we kept wondering is, how does Kendall's best friend Gigi feel about this?  Well, she isn't happy.  “Gigi is giving her little brother a warning,” the source has revealed. “ She told him that Kendall is a heartbreaker, and not to fall in love with her. Gigi knows that Kendall puts work and her career first with little time for a serious boyfriend or a long term relationship. So Gigi has made it clear to Anwar that while Kendall is a beautiful, sweet, smart, sexy, and a trusted friend, she is not to be messed with.”  It's true, since Kendall was just seen on a romantic date with NBA star Ben Simmons only a few days earlier.  However, Anwar “has had a crush on Kendall for years. Gigi fears her younger brother will fall in love with Kendall after one kiss so she told him to slow down.”  All we can do is watch this space!	1

"Though he touts his outstanding memory, when Donald Trump was asked under oath about his dealings with a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections, the real estate mogul was at a loss.Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add InterestEven though the man, Felix Sater, had played a role in a number of high-profile Trump-branded projects across the country.“If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,” Trump testified in a video deposition for a civil lawsuit two years ago.In recent weeks, the Republican Presidential candidate has been fending off critics who have accused him of embellishment, insensitivity and in some cases inaccuracy for his descriptions of the Muslim response to 9/11. Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.Away from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian émigré who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.”Asked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. ""Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,"" he told the reporter. ""I'm not that familiar with him.""Trump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to Trump’s lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a “senior advisor"" to Trump.Sater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his “most prized project.” For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a ""senior advisor"" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked Trump’s attorney about it, that portion of Sater’s online resume was deleted.The “senior advisor” title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News.Alan Garten, Trump’s General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump “had no real direct relationship with Felix Sater” and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump “in my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.”A few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of Sater’s Trump business card with the “senior advisor” title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of Sater’s actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles “in order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.”Cyrus McCrimmon/Denver Post/Getty ImagesGarten said Sater was “never employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organization” and that “no deals ever came from those activities” in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of Sater’s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it.Trump’s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.The cast of characters who participated in Trump’s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his “tremendous” record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States.The connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007.As Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when “somebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children” with a proposal for a development deal. “It could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,” Trump said, “but somebody from Bayrock.”Obtained by ABC NewsSater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, “I’ll kill you. I’ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.” Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.As he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million “pump and dump” stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had “planned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,” the release said.Prosecutors said Sater and others had “enlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.”Sater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past ""at your own risk"" but did not cite specific concerns.During this period, Sater’s role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the “chief operating officer” or “managing director.” In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. “I was probably number two man in the company,” he said. “The actual position, I don't remember what it was.”While the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.During this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, “exquisite gardens,” and “a world-class celebrity chef restaurant.”The project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against “the Trump/Bayrock Organization,” the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to “electrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.”Sater’s lawyer calls the allegation “an outright fabrication” made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.Reached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. Trump’s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit.Trump’s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.“To be clear,” Garten told ABC News, “Mr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.”Sater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring Sater’s ties to Trump and describing his “tangled past.” The article reported that Sater “had been an ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.”Sater told the Times that activity was in the past. “I’m trying to lead an exemplary existence,” he said then. “Old, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.”While Sater’s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a “cooperator” on a range of matters.Sater’s attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney.“The defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,” her statement said. He provided information “crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.”Garten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was “surprised.”“He had no idea,” Garten said. It “was the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.”Garten added, “When you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, it’s just not appropriate.""Once that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump “cut all ties” with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that.Asked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, “You’re going to look at the deal, you’re not going to look at the broker.”During his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about Sater’s past, Trump said he knew Sater had “got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.” And, he added, “I don’t know him very well, but I don’t think he was connected to the mafia.”In 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didn’t say “You’re fired!” to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.“I hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,” he said, walking out of the room.Trump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview.In August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogul’s past dealings with Sater. ""I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,"" Lewandowski replied. ""I've never heard of the guy.”For investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.Cathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown – which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with Trump’s photos and such slogans as ""There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE.""“I invested because it was Trump,” Cather told ABC News.ABC News' Randy Kreider and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report."	0
This article is over 8 months old  Duke of Edinburgh discharged after spending more than a week at King Edward VII hospital  The Duke of Edinburgh has been discharged from hospital after a hip operation.  Prince Philip, 96, left the private King Edward VII hospital in London at midday on Friday; he was admitted on Tuesday 3 April.  Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor, adding: “His royal highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received.”  On Thursday, he was visited by his daughter, the princess royal, who said he was “on good form”.  Anne, whose visit lasted about 50 minutes, is believed to be theonly member of the royal family to visit Philip in the central London hospital.  The Queen also gave an update, telling a wellwisher in Windsor: “He said he’s getting on very well.”  The duke will have begun his rehabilitation, moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of aftercare as he learns to walk again on his new hip.  For about a month before the operation, Philip had complained about trouble with the joint. Medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.  The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure aged 95, followed by an emergency operation when she was 97.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on 19 May is likely to be the first public appearance by the Queen’s consort since the operation.	0

"[Spoilers: This story contains full spoilers for season two of Netflix's Stranger Things.]  Goonies never say die ... except when they do.  In the penultimate installment of the second season of Stranger Things, the life-threatening stakes facing the denizens of Hawkins, Indiana, finally make their full impact known, by killing off one of the beloved main characters — a newbie, sure, but beloved all the same: Bob Newby (Sean Astin). Newby is, in fact, the goodhearted and ultimately ill-fated boyfriend of Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), and was savagely killed by a pack of demodogs in full view of Joyce, Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) and even the young party of friends once again caught in the thick of battle against the Upside Down.  ""That was a tough one,"" says Caleb McLaughlin, who plays Lucas Sinclair, on the subject of losing Astin from the show. ""He was so desperate to survive. And when Winona [as Joyce] watches it happen and she's crying? It was a really good scene. I cried.""  ""We all loved him,"" adds Noah Schnapp, who worked closely with Astin, thanks to Bob's role as a hopeful father figure to Will. ""He was like a kid. He was hilarious. I remember we were all with Winona, protesting to keep him on set and not have him get killed off. He was the best! He did get a really good kill scene, so that's pretty good. When I was watching it, I liked those scenes where you don't expect it. When I was watching, as an audience, you really don't expect it. It comes out of nowhere.""  According to creators the Duffer Brothers, it was always part of the plan to kill off Bob, even if some of the circumstances changed along the way — including the fact that Bob wasn't always the most likable character.  ""He wasn't supposed to be that big of a character, and he was supposed to die a lot earlier,"" says Matt Duffer. ""Then we found Sean Astin and met him and fell in love with this guy as a person and as an actor. We really started to fall in love with his character.""  According to executive producer Shawn Levy, there was initially some reluctance in hiring Astin as Bob, since The Goonies was already such an influence on season two: ""When Sean Astin read this role, it was so immediately compelling. He got the part because he's a rad actor, not because he's the guy from Goonies. If anything, that gave us pause because we knew people would assume it was due to that linkage, but it's just because he gave an incredible audition.""  During the course of the season, the Duffers started falling for Astin's performance as the hapless Bob Newby, once the head of the Hawkins Middle School audio/visual club when he was a kid, known by Hopper and others behind his back as ""Bob the Brain."" In his scenes with Joyce, Bob was frequently tickled with surprise over ending up with her all these years later, considering the different lives they led when they were kids. That star-crossed backstory only makes it more upsetting when the Radio Shack employee is ripped into by demodogs, defenseless due to having left one of Hopper's firearms behind elsewhere in Hawkins Lab.  ""Bob wasn't designed to be the likable character who perishes; he was designed to be kind of just an out-of-it dork,"" says Matt Duffer, in terms of how Bob was written. ""Sean Astin really transformed that role, to the point where we kept kicking his death down the road. We kept pushing it and pushing it until we could push it no further — when we got to episode eight and we realized narratively we still had to do it. It was the hardest scene to write all year, just because it was hard to lose that character and lose Sean. We had such a great time working with him.""  Describing Bob's death as season two's ""central heartbreaker,"" Levy thinks the fatal moment serves to fuel the stakes heading into the finale: ""It's an example of really what I hope season two succeeds at — a big emotional idea, told in a really ambitious and cinematic way. That's really what we're going with always for this series. Both seasons have a slower burn from everyday life and a desire for normalcy devolving into crazy-ass stuff, forcing heroism among our characters. That was the arc of season one and that was the arc of season two. Bob's death in the last third of season two was always a big pivot point to be our ramp into the finale action.""  Ironically enough, Bob dies shortly before justice for Barb (Shannon Purser) is finally achieved, thanks to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton). Can we expect fans to take up arms with ""Justice for Bob,"" heading into season three? The Duffers aren't so sure: ""I don't think you can ever re-create whatever happened with Barb."" Newby nation, I believe that's your cue.  Follow THR.com/StrangerThings for all of our continuing season two coverage."	1
How could no one behind Hard Summer’s new preview trailer suspect that so many fans would hate it?  The clip, which can be watched here and does contain imagery that could offend, may have been done with the intent to admirably satirize the lack of women on music festival bills (including Hard's). But doing so by putting gigantic prosthetic breasts on top-billed male acts including DJ Snake, What So Not, Party Favor and Claude VonStroke?	0

Brody Jenner‘s relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner hasn’t always been an easy one to navigate.  On Wednesday, PEOPLE confirmed Caitlyn will not attend her son’s upcoming wedding to fiancée Kaitlynn Carter.  Caitlyn, 68, “has work commitments that have been set up for months and couldn’t be changed in the end,” a source told PEOPLE.  Nevertheless, the source said “everything is good” between the two, adding that Caitlyn “will be throwing a big party for them when the newlyweds return to town.”  And while there’s no bad blood over the wedding, Brody and Caitlyn haven’t always had such a smooth relationship.  Caitlyn Jenner and Brody Jenner Earl Gibson III/Getty  A Rocky Childhood  Caitlyn has long acknowledged that she was an absent father to her four oldest children Cassandra, Burt, Brandon and Brody.  While the older Jenner children were not regulars on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Brody did open up about his strained relationship with his father on the show in 2013.  (Caitlyn went by Bruce before transitioning in 2015. She now goes by Caitlyn and uses female pronouns.)  “I think Bruce is an incredible human being and I think that Bruce is a great father, he just wasn’t a great father to me,” he said.  Brody said Caitlyn and his mother Linda Thompson had a “messy divorce” when he was young, which created tension in the family.  “I grew up with my stepdad,” said Brody, referring to David Foster. “Bruce was never around. I can’t tell you how many birthdays went by where Bruce wasn’t there. I resent him for that.”  Brody’s strained relationship with Caitlyn also caused a rift in his bond with sisters Kendall and Kylie. A source tells PEOPLE that Brody was “never close” with his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian after Caitlyn married Kris Jenner.  “He didn’t spend a lot of time with his dad when his dad married Kris, so he didn’t see them as much,” the sources says.  And while Brody spent time with Kendall and Kylie when they were younger, they’ve grown apart.  “As much as they love them, they’re not close,” the source adds. “It’s unfortunate.”  Understanding Caitlyn’s Transition  Before transitioning, Caitlyn battled depression and identity issues, which caused her to pull away from her family.  “The big, formative years for them, I was really struggling with those issues [of gender identity],” she said during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.  Still, she takes full responsibility for not being there for her kids.  “There’s no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems that you have,” Jenner told ABC in 2017. “No excuse for that.”  And the former Hills star has remained supportive of Caitlyn‘s transition.  “The first thing I thought was just like, ‘It finally makes sense,'” Brody told ABC in 2017.  In fact, Brody said he actually prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.  John M. Heller/Getty Images;  “I’ve known Bruce for a long time and I didn’t really get along with Bruce,” he said. “Caitlyn and I get along a little more, because Caitlyn is actually who she really is and she’s living her life finally now as the person she actually was.”  Brody said he was able to start fresh with Caitlyn and let go of his resentment toward his father.  “It’s like getting to know somebody – your dad – all over again, in a better way.”  Brody’s siblings have expressed similar sentiments about their father’s transition.  “In seeing him come out to me and explain his true self, I was more proud right then to carry the last name Jenner, to be a part of the family, than at any time before,” said Brandon.  Rebuilding a Relationship  Both Brody and Caitlyn have been making more of an effort to spend time together in recent years.  In 2016, Caitlyn spent Thanksgiving with Brody and his siblings.  “Thanksgiving with family is the best. And mine keeps getting bigger,” she wrote. “I hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!”  In April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.  “Caitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They’re so happy for Brody,” a source tells PEOPLE. “Brody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.”  Caitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.  “Went to my first bridal shower,” Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. “I had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!”  “I’m so happy you were there!!!” Carter commented on the post. “It meant a lot to me!!”	1
It's officially time to start brainstorming couple names.  Last night, low-key lovers Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx both attended the glamorous Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Awards Gala, and they looked so enamored of each other the whole time. Are things getting serious between these two?  For the Pre-Grammy event, 39-year-old Holmes looked ravishing in a floor-length red gown and dark red lipstick. Foxx kept it sharp in a navy blue tux, and while the two arrived separately, they were seated together and looked incredibly cozy throughout the night, smiling from ear-to-ear all the while.  Image zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS  According to People, Holmes tried to play it coy at the Gala, leaving the table before Clive Davis announced Foxx's presence. However, Davis pulled no punches, calling out the actress!  “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else,” Davis said, according to the source. “If you’re going to sit together what better night then tonight?”  Holmes and Foxx have been the subject of romance rumors for several years, but they've done a great job keeping their relationship out of the spotlight. However, they've been making more public appearances together lately, and we can't help but swoon over their relationship. They make an amazing couple!	0
The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.	1
Kim Kardashian will not leave Kanye West despite all the rumors.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have seen their names mentioned in hundreds of rumors over the years and they aren’t slowing down. Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.  According to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an “escape plan” to leave him.  “Things between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There’s concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.”  Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Kardashian has “exit strategies” and an “escape plan” in place to get away from West. She has shown some frustration with his controversial comments, but the two seems to be doing just fine despite all of the rumors.  “None of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian’s rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it’s ‘false’ she’s intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.”  Kardashian has come out and publicly joked that West is the cause of her first gray hair.  “[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.”  That is nothing to write home about as far as divorce rumors are concerned. She also went on to state that West is doing well and is out in Wyoming working on new music.  “He’s doing really good. He’s in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he’s just focused on that.”  West even took to Twitter to post a picture of Kim with fire emoji’s as the only description. Obviously, he still finds his wife incredibly beautiful.  Rumors are going to continue swirling. Nothing is going to change on the fake report front when it comes to Kardashian and West, but this report can be ignored now that Gossip Cop has debunked it.	1
"Lisa Bonet and Jason Momoa. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet secretly got married this October.  Although they normally keep things pretty low-key, Momoa opened up about their love to James Cordon.  He said he's had a crush on her since he was 8 years old, and that he freaked out when they first met.  Actors Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet have been one of Hollywood's cutest and most interesting couples for more than a decade now. And although they usually keep things pretty private, following the news of their recent secret wedding, Momoa has been sharing some sweet tidbits about their relationship.  Momoa, 38, appeared on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" and when Corden congratulated him on his recent nuptials, he happily flashed his new wedding ring. Though he and Bonet, 49, have been together for about 12 years, Momoa told Corden that their love story actually began 30 years ago, when he saw her on TV.  ""Listen it was more than [love at first sight]. Ever since I was 8 years old and I saw her on the TV I was like, 'Mommy, I want that one,'"" Momoa gushed. ""I was like, 'I'm going to stalk you for the rest of my life, and I'm going to get you.' I'm a full-fledged stalker.""  ""But yeah, I've just always wanted to meet her. She was a queen, always,"" he continued.  Despite Momoa's apparent convictions to making Bonet his wife one day, the story of how they actually met is a lot cuter. Momoa said that they met through mutual friends at a jazz club and he, understandably, freaked out about meeting his childhood crush.  ""I literally turned around and I see her and she goes, ya know, 'I'm Lisa,'"" he recalled. ""I turned around to my friend and I was like 'ahhh!' I had f------ fireworks going off inside man.""  These two love a good brew. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Afterwards, Momoa said he ""convinced her"" to take him home to his hotel and they ended up going out to Cafe 101 in New York City for a meal.  ""We sat down, she ordered a Guinness, and that was it,"" he said.  ""'Cause you love Guinnness, right? You ordered a Guinness tonight,"" Corden said.  ""I beyond love Guinness,"" Momoa said, gesturing to his mug. ""She ordered a Guinness and I ordered grits. We had Guinness and grits, and the rest is history.""  The two have two children together, Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha Momoa and Lola Iolani Momoa, and he serves as step-dad to Bonet's daughter, actress Zoë Kravitz.  Based on their long partnership and how lovingly Momoa talks about Bonet, I think it's safe to say that they will be sharing many more pints of Guinness and many more bowls of grits together as a married couple.

Not so fast. Despite reports, a source tells Us Weekly that Angelina Jolie is not off the market.  “Angie isn’t dating a real estate agent. She isn’t even dating at the moment,” the insider reveals. “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key.”  The Salt actress, 42, and estranged husband Brad Pitt officially called it quits in September 2016 after more than 10 years together and two years of marriage. They are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.  “The divorce talks between Brad and Angie are ongoing,” the source adds, noting that Pitt, 54, is lonesome for their children, who live with their mom. “Brad wishes the kids would spend overnights at his house, but he is hopeful that over time, that will organically happen.”  The Tomb Raider star and Pitt much of their marriage on the move, raising their family in various cities. But since their split, Jolie and the kids have remained in L.A. “Angie is frustrated that Los Angeles has become the home base for the family,” the source says. “Yes, she does travel, but she misses the nomadic lifestyle of moving around every three or four months. It’s best for the kids that they aren’t moving around all the time. Angie has a restless spirit and would have continued to roam around the world with the kids if the divorce hadn’t occurred. Brad insisted that the kids have stability and wanted them to stop moving around.”  Jolie opened up about raising her kids as a single mother in a September 2017 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s been difficult. I don’t enjoy being single,” the First They Killed My Father director admitted. “It’s not something I wanted. There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”  Although Jolie puts on a brave face for the cameras, she quietly battles her emotions. “Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it together, but really, I am just trying to get through my days,” she disclosed. “Emotionally, it’s been a very difficult year.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!	1
"Chris Pratt And Zoe Saldana Break Silence On James Gunn's Firing From Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend The geek world was rocked late last week when it was announced that James Gunn had been fired from the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In the days since we have heard from a few members of the franchise family, including Dave Bautista, Sean Gunn, and Michael Rooker - but two key names we didn't hear from were Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana.

I’m pausing myself to take everything in before I speak out of term. I just want everyone to know I love ALL members of my GOTG family. Always will. — Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) July 22, 2018 Without mentioning James Gunn by name, Zoe Saldana took to her personal Twitter account this afternoon to post a message about everything that has been happening. It seems that she is not yet ready to release a full comment on the situation, and instead simply stated that she loves ""ALL members of [the] GOTG family."" As for Chris Pratt's response to the James Gunn news, his message was even more cryptic. The actor, who saw his entire career change after being cast in Guardians of the Galaxy, chose a Bible verse as his means of communicating his thoughts - notably choosing a quotation from the Epistle of James in the New Testament: “Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters. Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.”    JAMES 1:19  ?????? — chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) July 22, 2018 Dave Bautista also noted in his statement that he would have more to say about this situation - and we can assume that this definitely won't be the last we here on the subject from Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. There are still some key members of the Guardians of the Galaxy cast who have not yet said anything publicly about James Gunn, including Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan and Pom Klementieff. Because all of them do press interviews throughout the year, we surely will hear something from them at least eventually. Right now, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 very much remains up in the air, with the project lacking a director - and it's unknown if Marvel Studios will still use the screenplay that Gunn has written for the trilogy capper. Production has been scheduled to start up in the early months of 2019, with the plan being to have the film in theaters some time in 2020. Neither Disney nor Marvel has officially commented on the status of the movie, or how/if it will be moving forward - but you can be sure that we will be keeping an eye out for updates, so stay tuned here on CinemaBlend."	0
With the charts and pop radio heavily tilted toward rap at the moment, there’s so many recognizable artists in the mix for the rap Grammys that, beyond Lamar, the nominations are anyone’s guess. At the 2016 ceremony, Lamar won all four trophies in the rap categories — making him the third act to score a clean sweep after Eminem and Kanye West. And he just might do the same this year.	1
"Uh-oh. Paris Jackson got cozy with Aussie model Tyler Green during the Melbourne Cup horse race in November, and her famous family isn’t exactly moonwalking with delight. They fear the pairing could spell trouble for the 19-year-old model, who’s struggled with sobriety in the past.  “Paris’ family worries she’ll start partying again because of Tyler,” an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. Tyler, 25, has bragged about his wild ways on Instagram, posting about months of “far too much drinking” and praising “bottomless red wine and pure debauchery.”  (Photo Credit: Splash)  Despite those red flags, Paris — who’s admitted to attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and who says she was suicidal after the death of dad Michael Jackson — is smitten. “Paris is trying to walk the straight and narrow, but she’s also looking for fun,” notes the insider. “She makes her own decisions, but her family wants her to make the right ones.”  Paris’ family’s concerns about her latest romance come months after she finally called it quits with on-and-off boyfriend Michael Snoddy. Back in February, a source told Us Weekly that the duo broke up after less than a year of dating. Though the insider said that Paris could end up reconciling with Michael in the future, they also said that the aspiring actress was more focused on her career than her love life.  “It appears that Paris and Michael have parted ways for now, but their future is uncertain,” the source said, adding that Paris was very excited about her guest role on Fox’s TV drama Star. “She is doing well, enjoying being on set with Lee Daniels and focusing her energy on the opportunities ahead.”  While she has yet to make her relationship with Tyler Instagram official, Paris did post a telling quote about love on Oct. 23: “People say love ism blind because they do not know what love is. I say unto you, only love has eyes; other than love, everything is blind.”  For more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now!

The reality star, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson of the Cleveland Cavaliers, stepped out on Saturday to celebrate the one-year anniversary of her Good American denim line.  While Kardashian, 33, was snapped by paparazzi a week ago in a baggy sweatshirt, for Saturday’s event she chose a plunging, belted black top, skintight leggings and sky-high heels.  According to People, the reality star did not address her pregnancy during the fashion celebration, but it sounds as though she’s happy to embrace any changes to her body.  “My weight fluctuates all the time and I love that at any size I feel comfortable,” she said during the event at the Century City Nordstrom. “When I was bigger and wore bigger clothes I looked even bigger. I love embracing my curves no matter what size I am.”  A source confirmed to Page Six on Sept. 26 that Kardashian is pregnant. We heard at the time that both Kardashian and Thompson, the father of a nearly 1-year-old son with ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig, are overjoyed about welcoming a child. Kardashian and Thompson started dating in September 2016.  Khloé’s 20-year-old sister Kylie Jenner is also pregnant, while older sister Kim Kardashian is expecting via surrogate with husband Kanye West. As Page Six previously reported, Kim and Kylie are expected to welcome their children around late January to early February, while Khloé is due soon after.	0
Jennifer Garner confronted Ben Affleck‘s girlfriend Lindsay Shookus in person after she found out about their affair in 2015, sources tell PEOPLE.  Garner was on a work trip to New York City when she approached Shookus about the fling. “Lindsay refused to back down or quit the affair,” says a source.    Responds a source close to Shookus: “Jennifer and Lindsay do not have any relationship.”  Multiple sources have told PEOPLE that Affleck and Shookus started having an affair in 2013, two years before the actor and Garner announced their separation. Shookus was also still with her husband Kevin Miller, then a fellow SNL producer. The two split in 2014.  However, other sources close to Affleck and Shookus maintain that the two were just friends and didn’t date before their respective separations.  Sources also say Garner spoke to Shookus’ ex about the affair. After appearing on an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Miller is now a supervising producer, Garner sought him out for a conversation.  The first source says she showed him text messages between Affleck and Shookus, adding, “she had proof.” (Miller and Shookus were already split at the time.)  Affleck and Shookus have been spending time together in L.A. since going public with their relationship last week.  For much more on Affleck and Shookus, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  RELATED VIDEO: Ben Affleck Reportedly Dating SNL Producer Lindsay Shookus  Affleck and Garner announced their separation in 2015 after over a decade of marriage and filed for divorce this past April. They have continued to closely co-parent their three children — Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.  “Ben and Jen continue to be dedicated to their family and kids,” says a source who knows Affleck and Garner. “They have been separated for two years now and have never strayed from that dedication. They do it better than anyone.”  Shookus married Kevin Miller in 2010 and the two share a daughter. “They’re both really good friends still,” says a source close to the situation. “They’re both good, devoted parents. Lindsay and Kevin’s marriage didn’t end over infidelity. There were issues they couldn’t resolve and they realized they were better as friends than together.”  Garner is handling her ex’s public relationship fine, sources have said. “Nothing is new for her here,” says one insider. “She’s in mama-bear mode.”	1
Lena Dunham is saying goodbye to her beloved cat Gia Marie.  “How do I even begin to type these words: this morning we lost the beautiful Gia Marie,” the Girls writer and creator wrote on Instagram on Thursday. “It was sudden and beyond anyone’s control and @greer_lankton_archives_museum [artist friend Paul Monroe] and I were holding her in our collective arms during her final moments.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Gia loved people, playing with colorful tulle and above all she loved her sister Irma. She was my love, my dearest companion, and her kisses and hugs made every morning a celebration. Our hearts are broken, but we will never forget the nine months she graced this pained planet with her radiance. #giamarieforever,” she continued, sharing the sad news alongside a series of photos of her sphynx cat.  In another emotional post, Dunham, 32, went on to reveal that after coming home to find Gia “limp and wheezing,” the cat died in her arms while being rushed to the vet.  “Yesterday I was due at work at 8am. Showed up, watched rehearsal, drank my Starbucks, chill times. But at 8:15 I started to feel sick. Chills, sore throat, rapid descent. So I told Jenni I had to go home. Now. It just felt urgent. I walked in the door and found Gia limp and wheezing. She died in my arms at 9:15 as we rushed to the vet. She called me home. I’m so glad I listened,” she explained.  In a separate post, she simply wrote, “My tiny baby Gia, gone but never forgotten 💔.”  RELATED: Medical Challenges, Dog Drama and More: A Look Back at Lena Dunham’s Emotional Year  Just three days before her pet’s death, Dunham spoke warmly about her cat on social media.  “I have two cats but only one sleeps on my face and sits on my lap while I pee. The positive effect Gia Maria Carangi has had on my mental health cannot be overestimated,” she captioned a photo of the pair.  Earlier this year, the writer and actress also gave the cat a special “woman crush wednesday” shoutout, writing, “#WCW #2 is Gia Marie Carangi the cat in her new angora lewk (she cares not what you feel about her nude belly. Like mama like baby.)”  Last year, Dunham found herself embroiled in some doggy drama after sharing that she and then-boyfriend Jack Antonoff had decided to re-home their dog Lamby, following “four years of challenging behavior and aggression.”  The writer experienced a backlash on social media, some of which centered on her claim that her dog’s behavioral issues were caused by “terrible abuse” Lamby suffered in the past. Robert Vazquez, a spokesperson for the shelter that Dunham adopted Lamby from, went on to say that the dog “wasn’t crazy” when Dunham adopted him.  However, Dunham’s dog trainer Matt Beisner, came to her defense. “She was at her wit’s end,” he said.  Dunham still has three pets at home: a sphinx cat named Irma and poodles Karen and Susan.	0
"Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (born January 17, 1964) is an American lawyer, university administrator, and writer who served as the First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. She is married to the 44th U.S. President, Barack Obama, and was the first African-American First Lady. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. She subsequently worked in non-profits and as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago and the Vice President for Community and External Affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992 and they have two daughters.  Obama campaigned for her husband's presidential bid throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She returned to speak for him at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, she delivered a speech in support of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, a former First Lady.  As First Lady, Obama served as a role model for women, and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.[1][2]  Family and education  Early life and ancestry  Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991),[3] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b.July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[4] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[5]  The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[3] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Low Country region.[6] Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[7][8] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[9][10] Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr. built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Low Country from Chicago after retirement.[7]  Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother (3xgreat-grandmother), Melvinia Shields, born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname. (Later she changed her surname.)[11]  As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus' father.[12] Dolphus Shields with his wife Alice moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Michelle Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio in the 20th century.[11]  All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina, he is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.[14][15]  Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[4][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a ""conventional"" home, with ""the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table.""[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[4][23]  Her father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined to stay out of trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it ""to fuel me, to keep me going.""[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[4] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27]  Education and early career  She was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University.[5] He graduated in 1983,[31] and was hired as a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University.[32] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, that she had been told she was ""setting my sights too high"".[33][34] She believed that her brother's status as an alumnus may have helped her during the admission process,[35] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worthiness.[31] She acknowledges that she was overwhelmed when first arriving in first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[36] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[37]  The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried (unsuccessfully) to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race. Robinson said that being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt ""like a visitor on campus.""[38][39] There were also issues of economic class. ""I remember being shocked,"" she says, ""by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.""[27]  While at Princeton, Robinson got involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students. She ran their day care center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[40] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt that it should be more conversational.[41] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[42][43] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[44] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[4][45]  Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[46] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased; ""This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place"".[44] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be ""both brilliant and black.""[47]  At Harvard Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minorities.[48] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[49] She is the third First Lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[50] She later said that her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[51]  Family life  Her father, Fraser C. Robinson III, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[52] She would later say that although he was the ""hole in my heart"" and ""loss in my scar"", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[37] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[53]  Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[54] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[55] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[56]  Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[57] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's 1989 movie Do the Right Thing.[58] Barack Obama has said that the two had an ""opposites attract"" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was ""adventurous"".[59] They married on October 3, 1992.[56] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[60] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[61]  The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for US President, Michelle Obama made a ""commitment to be away overnight only once a week – to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day"" for their two daughters.[62]  She once requested that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[63][64] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that ""Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.""[65] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule 'date nights' while they lived in Chicago.[66]  The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[67] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[5] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[68][69] In 2008 Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[70] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[69] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved into the White House to assist with child care.[71]  Religion  The Obamas attend a church service in Washington, D.C., January 2013.  Michelle Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: ""Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.""[72]  The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, ""To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.""[73]  Career  Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[4] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[74][75]  In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 years after she left.[20] Obama later said that she had never been happier in her life prior to working ""to build Public Allies"".[76]  In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the University's Community Service Center.[77] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as Vice President for Community and External Affairs.[78]  She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[79] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[80]  According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.[81]  Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS),[82] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL-CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[83] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[84]  Barack Obama political campaigns  Early campaigns  During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a ""strong possibility"" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was ""wary"" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[85]  Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[86][87] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[88]  2008 Presidential campaign  At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[89] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[90] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign she has said: ""My job is not a senior adviser"".[63][91][92] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[41]  In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only two days a week and rarely traveled overnight;[93] by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[64] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[94][95] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27]  During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an ""Angry Black Woman""[96][97][98] and some web sites attempted to promote this image.[99] Obama said: ""Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.""[100]  By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[86] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[96] her appearance on The Viewwas widely covered in the press.[101]  The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[91] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[81][90]  New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote:  I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal – a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[91][102]  On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[103] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[104] Obama said she and her husband believe ""that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.""[105] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt 'proud of her country for the first time'.[104][106][107] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[108] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[109] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[110]  On an October 6, 2008 broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said that her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[111] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[112] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas on the night that he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a ""terrorist fist jab"". Hill was taken off air and the show was cancelled.[113][114]  2012 Presidential re-election campaign  Obama (far right) celebrates with Jill Biden after their husbands win re-election.

Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[115] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[116][117] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[118] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[119] An Obama senior campaign official said she was ""the most popular political figure in America"".[120] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity.  Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both ""sharp enmity and deep loyalty"" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[118] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said that Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[121]  Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[122] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[123][124] The consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter 'won' the debate.[125] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the First Lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[126]  Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said that the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[127] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[128][129] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, ""...nobody votes for first lady.""[130]  First Lady of the United States (2009–2017)  During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[131] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[131][132]  Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[133]  Obama and General Charles R. Davis smile to the crowd before speaking on her mission to help military families, October 2009.  On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[134] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker.  In 2009 Michelle Obama was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of the year.[135]  Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[136][137] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[137] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV).The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[138] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[139]  Obama holding a sign with the hashtag ""#bringbackourgirls"" in May 2014.  Obama meets future First Lady Melania Trump in November 2016.  In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a ""feminist nightmare"" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[140][141][142] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that ""She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.""[140] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked ""Are you serious?""[141][142] Supporters of Obama note that the First Lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[143]  In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The First Lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[144]  Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[145] A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn.[146] On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea.[147] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders.[148][149] Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[149] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could be talked into running. He responded, ""There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.""[150][151] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to ""impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way.""[152]  Let's Move!  Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[153][154][155][156]  In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named ""Let's Move!,"" to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[155][157] On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[158]  Michelle Obama said that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: ""I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.""[155] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[159] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[160]  Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[161] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican Governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the First Lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[162][163] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was ""working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.""[164] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife was First Lady.[165]  LGBT rights  Obama's first term official portrait.  In the 2008 US presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democrat groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, ""We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.""[166][167][168]  After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[169] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[170] Michelle said  ""This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.""[171]  At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, ""Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.""[172]  Domestic travels  Malia and Sasha Obama prepare to enter Air Force One, Michelle Obama and President Obama behind them, on March 7, 2015.  In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[173]  In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[174][175] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that he was honored the First Lady ""would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment"".[176][177]  In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[178] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[179][180]  In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[181]  In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[182] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[183]  Foreign trips  Obama with children in Delhi , November 8, 2010.  On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace, Obama embracing her before attending an event with world leaders.[184] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[185][186]  In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[187] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[188][189] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that ""potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places"", citing herself and her husband as examples.[190][191]  Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Graça Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[192] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[193][194]  In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[195][196] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said that the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize ""the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples"".[197][198]  In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[199][200] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[201] even being praised in some corners.[202] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[203]  In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[204] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her ""Let Girls Learn"" initiative in Doha, Qatar and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][205][206] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[207]  In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[208][209] Later that month, the First Couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[210] meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri.[211][212]  Midterm elections  Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[213][214] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[215][216] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[217] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[218] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[219] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[220] Though viewed as essential by the White House, aides reported that she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[221] After the elections took place, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her ""election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state.""[222]  Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized that she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, ""the first lady is very popular"".[223] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[224] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be ""hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012"".[225][226] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[224] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[227] Obama raised her profile in October,[228][229] touring three states in four days.[227] Obama called the elections her husband's ""last campaign"".[230][231]  Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign  Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[232] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[233] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[234] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[235][236]  Public image and style  With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among ""25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women.""[237][238] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among ""10 of the World's Best Dressed People."" She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a ""young'un"" paying tribute to the ""Legends"" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of 'The Harvard 100'; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[237][239] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[240] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her ""classic and confident"" look.[241][242]  At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans.[243][244] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[245] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[246][247]  Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[131][248] as she was accepted as a role model.[131] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.[249] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called ""star power""[248] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[238] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[250] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[250][251] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[252]  Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style,[240] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[253][254] Obama's style has been described as ""fashion populist.""[50] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than 50 design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company.[255] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[256] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[257][258]  Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[259][260] Every First Lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[259] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[261] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[262] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[263] During the 2013 Academy Awards, she became the first First Lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to Argo).[264]  The media have been criticized for focusing more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[50][265] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[243][266][267] In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[268] and stated that Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[71][269]  Subsequent activities  In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[270] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[271] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[272] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[273] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[274] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[275] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[276] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[277] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[278]  In February 2018, Obama announced that her memoir Becoming would be released on November 13, 2018.[279]  Despite speculation that she would be running for president in 2020, Barack Obama stated during a campaign rally in Nevada that Michelle would not be running for president in 2020. Michelle has previously stated that she has no passion for politics.[280]  Authored books  Book reviews  New York Journal of Books, 2018 [281]  References  Further reading"	0
Scott Disick‘s girlfriend Sofia Richie celebrated her 20th birthday in a bikini — and his ex Kourtney Kardashian apparently refused to be outdone, following up with a topless shot.  “I’m like goddamn bitch, I am not a teen choice #20,” Richie captioned her sultry snap.  Hours later on Friday, Kardashian, 39, took to her Instagram story from a swanky walk-in closet wearing jeans, heels and nothing on top but a necklace — plus her arm and a text bar reading “proud wife” obscuring her nipples. She captioned the image, “I swear this is about [pal] Steph [Shepherd’s] jeans.”  Richie has been dating Disick, 35, for about a year.  Kardashian, who shares sons Mason and Reign and daughter Penelope with Disick, split from a much younger lover of her own, 25-year-old model Younes Bendjima, earlier this month.  Disick and Kardashian discussed their rocky on-again-off-again romance on the 10-year-anniversary special of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” in September 2017.  “The debauchery that’s gone on has definitely closed the door several billion times [on a reconciliation], but it’s been back open,” Kardashian said at the time.  Disick quipped, “Here’s the thing, every time I become too good of a person, she stops loving me because she fell in love with a guy who was a little bit f–ked up … I treat you like royalty, you don’t say hello to me. I spit in your face, you’re like, ‘Hey babe.’ ”  Kardashian and Disick split, seemingly for good, in July 2015.	1
Hmmmk. Farrah Abraham took to Instagram to reveal that she had a procedure done that would make most women cringe.  The Teen Mom OG star documented her experience undergoing vaginal rejuvenation at the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center in Los Angeles on Saturday, August 26.  Loving my lady parts! #vaginalrejuvenation ? @beverlyhillsrejuvenationcenter @la_laser_lady @sarafowler_ Schedule your noninvasive appointment today ??? #Lasvegas #beverlyhills A post shared by Farrah Abraham (@farrah__abraham) on Aug 26, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  One photo showed the reality star standing alongside a doctor in front of a lobby desk, wearing a pretty lace top with a black skirt. She captioned it, “Loving my lady parts!” with the hashtag #vaginalrejuvenation.  The reality star, 26, also tagged the clinic before encouraging her followers to “Schedule your noninvasive appointment today.” Another photo showed the sex tape star wearing a shiny silver bra and lying on an examination table with a sheet over her legs while she underwent the procedure.  In a video Abraham uploaded, her doctor explained the process of vaginal rejuvenation, saying, “What this does is distributes little wounds through radio frequency which kind of breaks up the collagen and forces it to restore during that healing process, so everything becomes tighter and you actually experience …”  “Like I’m 16 again?” the My Teenage Dream Ended author interrupted.  “There you go, like you’re 16 again!” the doctor answered with a laugh.  Abraham’s followers quickly slammed the single mom for sharing the private procedure. One person wrote, “My god…poor little Sophia. A mother who ‘loves’ her body so much she altered every bit of it. Great example. I hope Sophia will grow into a strong and independent woman who does not need her ‘mother’ to be around.”  Another commented, “Farrah why? I understand you’re a mom and need the procedure for personal reasons but why make it public? Have respect as a mother for your child and for others.”  A third follower simply asked, “Aren’t you like 25? Why do you need this?”  The MTV star has previously undergone plastic surgery to alter her nose and chin, and has breast implants. She also shared pics on Twitter in 2015 of an allergic reaction she had to lip implants. Abraham also met with a surgeon in 2016, in a segment shown on The Doctors, to look into getting a butt lift.

ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.	1
"Hollywood star Angelina Jolie's fans have expressed their concern over the actress' bold style statement when meeting the head of the Church of England.  On Thursday (16 March), the 41-year-old actress sat down with Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to discuss pressing issues; unfortunately, it was her alleged braless look that grabbed eyeballs sending Twitter into a meltdown.  Fans shocked by the actress' daring outfit began criticising her soon after her pictures from the meeting were tweeted by the Anglican leader.  ""Privilege to welcome UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie. Discussed refugee crisis, South Sudan and prevention of sexual violence in conflict,"" the archbishop had captioned the pictures.  ""She needs a bra. Looks like she could poke someone's eye out. How embarrassing!"" a shocked viewer wrote on Twitter. Another user mockingly asked the archbishop to maintain his focus, ""Eyes up, Archbishop!"" the tweet read.  One of the angry tweets branded her ""shameless"" while another furious tweet said: ""Angelina Jolie is a trick ass ho in this pic. You are meeting religious figures, wear a goddamn bra.""  Jolie met the Archbishop to discuss topics such as sexual violence, the refugee crisis and South Sudan. However, on social media at least, the focus was on her clothing — a full-sleeved grey sweater and an ivory-pleated skirt.  Welby, on the other hand, only had good words for the global star. ""The role of the U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy on Refugees, Angelina Jolie Pitt, is one that has been extraordinary,"" he said.  ""What she said just now sums up so beautifully the issues we are facing, and puts it so precisely in terms of the challenge that there is. It's wonderful that she has committed her time, her energy, and has taken great personal risks in order to be able to speak authentically as to what she's done.""  Take a look at some of the reactions on Twitter to Jolie's meeting with the archbishop below:"	1
(If you’re having trouble viewing this video on a mobile device, click here.)  Where’s Kylie? That’s the question Kardashian fans were asking when the reality TV family finally unveiled their annual Christmas card Monday afternoon but a reportedly pregnant Kylie Jenner was noticeably absent.  In fact, fans were fuming on Twitter and elsewhere that they had fallen for what turned out to be a 25-day-long tease to the card’s release.  Each day, starting Dec. 1, Kim Kardashian and other members of the clan released a photo from the family’s Christmas card photo shoot, showing different group shots, including of Kim and Kanye West with their two kids, North and Saint.  Fans had expected that 20-year-old Kylie, reported to be well into her first pregnancy with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, would finally display her baby bump on the Dec. 25 card.  Instead, the card showed nearly all the Kardashian-Jenner women and grandchildren, including Kris Jenner and grandmother Mary Jo “M.J.” Houghton. But there was no Kylie Jenner.  Khloe Kardashian was there, though with no baby bump yet visible, possibly because the photo shoot took place sometime in early November, E! News reported. She already had confirmed her pregnancy on Dec. 20 with a baby bump photo posted to her Instagram account.  Khloe’s long-expected public acknowledgement that, yes, she is having a baby with NBA star Tristan Thompson raised fans’ expectations that Kylie would use the family’s annual card to publicly confirm her pregnancy as well.  But when Kylie didn’t, fans seemed ready to declare a national state of emergency or a state of something related to the family.  “Maybe we should call the authorities because @KylieJenner is still missing from the damn Kardashian Christmas card,” one fan tweeted.  “I need to see the BELLY,” wrote another.  “I hate that I am so invested in Kylie Jenner’s alleged pregnancy,” another tweeted.  Others grew more belligerent and hurled expletives:  “Lmaoooooo THEY MIND F—KED US ALL MONTH LONG!!!!” one put it bluntly. “What is this total f—kery they have done to us!!! C’mon @KylieJenner @KimKardashian we wanted Kylie on the damn 25th day!!!”  But the young lip kit mogul wasn’t in total hiding on Christmas Day. She and big brother Rob Kardashian, who also was absent from the family holiday card photos, appeared on Khloe’s Snapchat on Monday. Kylie also shared a photo of herself on the cover of Love magazine, though the photo only showed her face.  Still her absence from the Christmas card itself left fans wondering if she’ll ever confirm her pregnancy or what other occasion she’s holding out for — perhaps for the next season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”  Here are some more fan reactions:  this would’ve been the perfect marketing ploy. so why didn’t they use it? where is kylie and that bump? pic.twitter.com/E77ur2KJnY — 💿 (@squareups) December 26, 2017  She must be behind that tree — 🌻📷 (@IviweVikki) December 26, 2017	0

"IN a rumble of reality-show divas, Shanna Moakler and Kim Kardashian had a screaming catfight at Carmen Electra's party at the DKNY Jeans Beach House in Malibu Sunday night.  Moakler, the former Miss USA and co-star of MTV's ""Meet the Barkers,"" threw a drink in the face of Kardashian, star of E!'s ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" and yelled ""Whore!"" at her.    The bootylicious daughter of late O.J. Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian once modeled for Famous Stars and Straps, the clothing line of Moakler's ex-husband, rock drummer Travis Barker. But according to Shanna, Kim wanted more from Barker than modeling work.    ""She was sending him text messages and e-mails, and this was when Travis and I were working on (staying together),"" Moakler told Page Six. ""When it happened, I asked her, 'What are these e-mails?' She had no answers for me. She was blatantly disrespectful.""    Moakler says she wouldn't even have gone to the party if she had known Kardashian was going to be there.    ""I was going to leave, but I'm a human being. I get upset. I wasn't drunk, and I confronted her. She ruined my marriage and my family. If I get passionate about it, they call me crazy,"" Moakler relates.    She says that Kardashian boyfriend Reggie Bush tried to calm them and that ""I told him, 'Your girl's a whore.' I told him Kim sent Travis messages to meet up secretly.""    Kardashian retaliated on Monday by strolling around in a T-shirt from Barker's line in front of the paparazzi. ""It was in the poorest of taste,"" said Moakler.      Originally published as Kim Kardashian soaked in catfight"	1
"She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release.  And Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night.  The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida.  Baggy dress: Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night  The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset.  The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do.  The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels.  Stepping out: The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida  Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish.  The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance.  The artist explained on Thursday why she was staying silent, telling people that they should listen to her upcoming album if they want to discover things she'd rather rap about than talk about, during an interview on Apple Music out Thursday.  Striking: The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset  Blonde ambition: The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do  Sharp: Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish  Sole survivor: The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels  Keeping mum: The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance  Hot right now: She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release  Speaking to Ebro Darden, the starlet said: 'I feel like people just got to tune in a little bit on my album and they will know a little bit more because I can't address all the rumors and everything.  'I have been so open to people about myself. People cannot expect me to be open about everything. Certain things to me, it has to be private. You cannot invade my privacy,' said B ahead of her Friday album release.  Cardi - who became engaged to Offset in October last year - blasted the idea that she should be open like an 'animal in the zoo', and hinted that people would only know if she was pregnant 'if it [the baby] arrives'.  Speaking during an interview for Beats 1 Radio, Cardi said: 'I'm not a damn animal at the zoo that you just could see everything, no. People will just find out more. If it arrives, if it don't arrive, then you gonna know what the f**k is going on.'  At the beginning of December, 2017, Cardi B said that she and Offset plan to spend $1 million on their wedding.  Loved up: One member Offset is also engaged to rapper Cardi B who happens to be the hottest up-and-comer in hip-hop, as the couple are pictured together in February  'We're going to spend over a million,' she told BBC Radio One’s Charlie Sloth.  The pregnancy rumors come after Offset's iCloud was hacked and photos and footage was leaked of him with another girl.  Cardi forgave her beau for the gaffe, and said she doesn't owe an explanation to those who wonder why she didn't leave the star.  She said: 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck like, ""Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem.""  'I don't have low self-esteem ... I know I look good. I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented. I know I could get any man I want - any basketball player, football player.  'But I want to work out my s**t with my man, and I don't got to explain why. I'm not your property. This is my life... I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision...  'It's not right, what he f***ing did, but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.'  While Cardi was willing to forgive the Motorsport rapper (seen in her Bartier Crdi video above) for his indiscretion, she was less understanding about people's unsolicited advice, saying 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck'  Last year, she signed a record deal with Atlantic Records, whose other artists include Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran.  Cardi B’s ‘Bodak Yellow’ topped Billboard 100 for three consecutive weeks and her boyfriend, Migos’ Offset, became her fiancé when he proposed to her in October.  Her first music appearance was in November 2015, on Shaggy’s ‘Boom Boom’ remix single.  Following two mixtapes, Gangsta B*tch Music, Vol. 1 and Gangsta B*tch, Vol. 2, the rapper signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in February, 2017.  In May of the same year, Cardi B was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the 2017 BET Awards.  In January 2018, Cardi B surpassed Beyonce as the first female artist to have five Top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in the same week.  She is also featured on Bruno Mars’s ‘Finesse (Remix)’ and appeared in the accompanying 90s video."	0
"Harry Styles proved to be a knight in shining armour for a fan who suffered a panic attack at one of his concerts.  The former One Direction singer was midway through an acoustic performance of Just a Little Bit of Your Heart at London’s Hammersmith Apollo when he spotted a female fan having trouble in the crowd.  Styles told fans to take a step back and allow the security guards some room to tend to the girl.  In a video shared on Twitter he can be heard saying: “Is everyone OK? You still with me? Do you want to help her up? If everyone could give a little bit of space. Just chill for one second, we'll get some people.”  According to Uproxx the fan, named Annie, recalled the “horrendous” incident in a series of tweets in which she referred to the young singer as “pure”.  She wrote: “Harry Styles stopped his entire show because I got crushed and then watched me being pulled over the barrier. That was one of the most horrendous panic attacks I’ve ever had, like even the medics were terrified of the state I was in.  “Harry is so f****** pure I can’t believe it. I feel like f****** s*** but I’m so grateful to Harry for having such a pure heart and stopping the show to get security to help me.”  One Direction's Harry Styles - In pictures 45 show all One Direction's Harry Styles - In pictures 1/45 The early days Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Zane Malik and Niall Horan of 'One Direction' attend a photocall during the X Factor press conference at the Connaught Hotel on December 9, 2010 Getty Images 2/45 Olympic moment Harry Styles of the One Direction band performs at the Olympic stadium during the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games in London on August 12, 2012 AFP/Getty Images 3/45 Front row Harry Styles, Nick Grimshaw and Kelly Osbourne attend the House Of Holland show during London Fashion Week SS14 on September 14, 2013 in London Getty Images 4/45 Harry's hair-Styles Harry Styles of One Direction performs on stage at CenturyLink Field on July 15, 2015 in Seattle Getty Images 5/45 Young direction Rex Features 6/45 2010 Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik arrive for an autograph signing session at the HMV store, Bradford PA Archive/PA Images 7/45 2010 Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Zain Malik and Louis Tomlinson of 'One Direction' attends the Very.co.uk Christmas Catwalk Show at Victoria House on November 24, 2010 in London Getty Images 8/45 2010 Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Cher Lloyd and Niall Horan sighted getting some snacks before returning to an X Factor recording studio on October 4, 2010 in London Getty Images 9/45 2010 Harry Styles attends the Royal Film Performance and World Premiere of 'The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader' at Odeon Leicester Square on November 30, 2010 in London Getty Images 10/45 2011 Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne of 'One Direction' attend the GQ Men Of The Year Awards at The Royal Opera House on September 6, 2011 in London Getty Images 11/45 2012 Harry Styles celebrates after winning best British Single for What Makes You Beautiful during the 2012 Brit awards at The O2 Arena, London PA 12/45 2012 Harry Styles of One Direction attends ""El Hormiguero"" Tv show at Vertice Studio on October 31, 2012 in Madrid, Spain Getty Images 13/45 2012 One Direction attend Nickelodeon Hosts Orange Carpet Premiere For Original TV Movie ""Big Time Movie"" Starring Big Time Rush at 583 Park Avenue on March 8, 2012 in New York City Getty Images 14/45 2013 Harry Styles of ""One Direction"" attends a photo call and press conference for ""One Direction This Is Us"" at Big Sky Studios on August 19, 2013 in London Getty Images 15/45 2013 Harry Styles attends the Teen Choice Awards 2013 at Gibson Amphitheatre on August 11, 2013 in Universal City, California Getty Images 16/45 2013 Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Harry Styles of One Direction pose with their Brits Global Success Award in the press room at the Brit Awards 2013 at the 02 Arena on February 20, 2013 in London Getty Images 17/45 2013 Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction perform on stage during the Brit Awards 2013 at the 02 Arena on February 20, 2013 in London Getty Images 18/45 2013 Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Mailik and Naill Horan in TriStar Pictures' ""One Direction: This Is Us."" 19/45 2013 Harry Styles attends the British Fashion Awards 2013 at London Coliseum on December 2, 2013 in London Getty Images 20/45 2013 Niall Horan,Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik of One Direction perform at Rumsey Playfield on November 26, 2013 in New York City Getty Images 21/45 2013 Simon Cowell and Harry Styles attend the ""One Direction This Is Us"" world premiere after party on August 20, 2013 in London Getty Images 22/45 2013 Harry Styles with the British Style bought to you by Vodaphone Award poses in the winners room at the British Fashion Awards 2013 at London Coliseum on December 2, 2013 in London Getty Images 23/45 2014 Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan of One Direction, winner of the British Video and Global Success BRIT awards, pose in the winners room at The BRIT Awards 2014 at 02 Arena on February 19, 2014 in London Getty Images 24/45 2014 Harry Styles from One Direction poses with fans at the 28th Annual ARIA Awards 2014 at the Star on November 26, 2014 in Sydney Getty Images 25/45 2014 Harry Styles accepts the Favorite Pop/Rock Album award for 'Midnight Memories' onstage at the 2014 American Music Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A.

It’s been three years since Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick parted ways — but no matter how much time passes, he will always be considered a part of her family.  After nine years together, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and Disick split in July 2015. Since their breakup, both have found love with someone new: Kardashian, 39, with boyfriend Younes Bendjima and Disick, 35, with girlfriend Sofia Richie.  Though Kardashian and Disick are no longer romantically linked, they continue to co-parent their three children: sons Mason Dash, 8½, and Reign Aston, 3½, and daughter Penelope, 6.  “I think Scott will always be family, and so we really try to have a good relationship for the kids,” Kardashian told PEOPLE about Disick while promoting the new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram  She also revealed that KUWTK audiences will catch a glimpse of how their relationships with their significant others has impacted their co-parenting rhythm.  “I think you’ll see that on the season a bit, but you know we really do our best to make the kids the priority,” she said.  In addition to appearing on KUWTK, Disick will soon be starring in his own E! reality show about his hobby of flipping home.  “It will probably come out next year, and it’s basically about me doing things that I’m interested in, which is buying and selling properties,” he told PEOPLE last weekend.  And as he embarks on this new endeavor, Kardashian will be cheering him on from the sidelines.  “I’m excited! I think that he’s great at that; it’s always been a passion of his,” she said. “He puts his own spin on the houses, so I think it’s amazing. I can’t wait to see it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kourtney Kardashian ‘Trusts’ Sofia Richie with Her and Scott Disick’s Kids: Source  With the season 15 premiere episode just days away, Kardashian also hinted that there will be lots of drama in store for viewers.  “I think this was probably our craziest fight that we’ve ever had,” she shared about an explosive moment between her and sister Kim Kardashian West.  She explained, “I think I’ve always been the sister who like I would just tell them like it is or if they said something to me, I’d just break them right down the fastest and make them upset and now I’ve been working on being more in touch with my feelings. I think I just couldn’t take it anymore. I just felt like we needed to make a change and not be so critical.”  “We’ve always been a family who will do anything for each other and we know that at the end of the day, but sometimes there’s criticism and I felt not good hanging out with them everyday and I couldn’t take it anymore,” said Kardashian. “So you’ll see in the season how it plays out.”  Season 15 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!	1
"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Menzies (right) replaces Matt Smith in the role of Prince Philip  The Queen has found her prince for the next series of The Crown.  Former Game of Thrones and Outlander actor Tobias Menzies will star as Prince Philip in the Netflix show, opposite Olivia Colman as the Queen.  He takes over from Matt Smith and will portray the Duke of Edinburgh from the 1960s to 1980s.  The 44-year-old actor, who played Edmure Tully in Game of Thrones, is expected to be seen in the royal role from next year.  It's understood that he has signed up for seasons three and four of The Crown, with the cast changes allowing the characters to be seen as they age.  Colman signed up to play Queen Elizabeth II in January, replacing Claire Foy.  Image copyright Netflix Image caption Foy and Smith play the young Elizabeth II and Prince Philip  Menzies has already starred opposite Colman in The Night Manager, playing Geoffrey Dromgoole.

Other casting is yet to be announced - but Helena Bonham Carter has been tipped to take over the role of Princess Margaret.  Vanessa Kirby, who currently plays the Queen's sister, appeared to confirm the news by posting an Instagram picture of her alongside Bonham Carter, with the caption ""honoured"".

Production company Left Bank Pictures apologised to both stars - who said they were not aware of each other's pay.  Shakespeare role  Menzies was the groom at Game of Thrones' infamous Red Wedding, one of the show's most memorable and talked-about moments.  In time travel drama Outlander he plays 20th Century character Frank Randall, as well as his 18th Century ancestor Jonathan Randall.  Other roles include an appearance in James Bond film Casino Royale, as M's assistant Villiers.

"Despite all the engagement buzz surrounding Gwen Stefani and her boyfriend Blake Shelton, don’t expect to see a diamond ring popping up on that finger anytime soon.  The 49-year-old sat down with Today’s Natalie Morales for a candid interview about her relationship with the country singer, sharing that the two are in no rush to get married.  Image zoom Kevin Mazur/WireImage  “There is zero pressure,"" she said, esecially, ""when there’s trauma, the way that we had trauma back in the day.""  ""Going through all these hard times, [you] get to a place where you find somebody that’s like your best friend, that you know you can depend on and trust and go through life — we’re just trying to be in the moment as much as we can.”  The trauma that the No Doubt frontwoman is most likely referencing is the couple's shared history of divorce. Prior to becoming an item in 2015, Shelton had split from wife Miranda Lambert and Stefani from husband Gavin Rossdale after his alleged cheating scandal. However, Stefani told Morales that it's these similarities in their past relationships that have actually brought them closer as couple.  RELATED: Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Plan to Have a Baby Via Surrogate: Report  So, close it seems, that the performer now considers Shelton her “forever.”  “He’s your forever, right?” Morales asked Stefani.  “I hope so!” she shared. “I never thought I would get this moment, and so it’s just really special.  While we couldn’t be happier for the mom of three, we can’t say that we were surprised by her response given that Shelton said almost the exact same thing last month when he admitted to ET that the “forever” lyric in the pair’s romantic duet, “You Make It Feel Like Christmas,” was “of course” about their relationship.  Image zoom Rachel Murray/Getty Images  Though the couple won’t be getting engaged anytime soon, we can rest assured knowing that after three years of dating, our favorite couple is still “madly in love” per People’s report.  “Blake has wanted to take his time with marriage, but he is absolutely committed to Gwen,” a source told People. “They both feel they’ve found their true partner in life and plan to be together forever.”"	0

"Brad Pitt is not looking for a serious relationship The Hollywood actor prefers to spend time with his children  Court warns Angelina, asks her to allow Brad more access to kids 00:36  Hollywood star Brad Pitt is in better spirits as he is getting to spend more time with his children. The actor, 54, will soon be in London, where ex Angelina Jolie is currently filming 'Maleficent 2 ' to see his children for a second time in recent weeks. 'The visit comes after a judge presiding over the former couple's divorce proceedings established a detailed schedule for him to spend time with Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.""Having kids was always very special to him. He wanted kids for years before he met Angie. He was dreaming about being a dad. And he has always been a great dad. Very involved and present. He talks about the kids non-stop now. He brought gifts back to England,"" a source told .The court papers stated, ""The children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,"" and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she does not allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.Their oldest son Maddox , 16, is not included in the timetable because, according to the court, he is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.""Brad has been in the best mood. Although he was away from the kids for a week, it seems just the fact that he now knows when he will see them, makes him very happy. He couldn't wait to get back to England.

Britney Spears‘ return to her Piece of Me Las Vegas residency after a summer hiatus got off to a terrifying start when a fan rushed the stage.  The incident occurred Wednesday night just as the 35-year-old pop star finished performing “(You Drive Me) Crazy” towards the end of her set at the AXIS auditorium inside Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. In a video obtained by TMZ, Spears engaged the crowd, initially unaware that a man had climbed onto the stage, attempting to get her attention. Quick-thinking dancers encircled the crasher until security agents arrived onstage and surrounded the headliner.  X17Online/YouTube  “Is something OK?” Spears asked. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?” Then — visibly frightened — she gasped, “He’s got a gun?” Her mic was switched off as she was rushed to safety offstage. Loyal fans voiced their support, chanting, “We love you!”  (Warning: The video above contains graphic language.)  The man (who did not have a gun) struggled with security, even kicking a member of the force as he executed a cartwheel. Muscular members of her dance squad gathered to subdue the man until more security guards arrived, at which point the intruder was restrained and escorted offstage to chants of “A–hole! from the crowd. Before he was ejected from the theater, the man succeeded in kneeing one of the guards.  Las Vegas law enforcement officials told PEOPLE that the intruder was 37-year-old Jess Webb, who apparently had been acting disorderly during the performance. After allegedly being asked to leave, Webb leapt to the stage. He was arrested for trespassing after the incident.  “On Aug. 9, 2017, officers from the LVMPD arrested 37-year-old Jesse Webb for trespassing during a Britney Spears concert. Webb was asked to leave the concert by security prior to him jumping on stage and dancing,” the statement read. “Webb was transported to the Clark County Detention Center.”  Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department  Just before the show, Spears had tweeted a warm message to her Vegas audience.  Feels so good to be back in Vegas!! #PieceOfMe returns tonight! 🦋 — Britney Spears (@britneyspears) August 9, 2017  She’s scheduled to return to the stage on Friday. A rep for Spears did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.	1
Selena Gomez had a strong support system during her recent kidney transplant, including boyfriend The Weeknd.  A source close to the 25-year-old tells PEOPLE that the R&B star — born Abel Tesfaye — did all he could to help his girlfriend recover after she underwent surgery following complications from the chronic autoimmune disease Lupus.  “Abel has been one of her biggest supports. She had been traveling with him on his tour and he was off during her surgery and right after during her recovery,” the insider says.  “He’s been very caring and it’s meant a lot to her to have him by her side.” The pair were seen out and about on Friday in New York City.  BACKGRID  Gomez revealed the transplant news in an Instagram post on Thursday, sharing a photo of herself and her friend, Francia Raisa — who donated a kidney — next to each other in hospital beds.    “I’m very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn’t promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of,” Gomez wrote in the post. “So I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health.”  The insider says that Gomez is “feeling much better” in the wake of the operation.  Selena Gomez Instagram  “She was feeling really lethargic and worn out before the surgery,” the insider tells PEOPLE. “The surgery was a couple months ago so she’s been recovering and is in a much healthier place now. Her close group of girlfriends have all been there for her”  Earlier this week, another source told PEOPLE that The Weeknd scheduled performances around Gomez’s medical emergency.  Meet Francia Raisa, Selena Gomez’s Actress BFF Who Gave Her a Kidney  The Weeknd was in between dates of his Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour from July 22 through Aug. 6, then again until Sept. 6.  The Grammy winner’s Grey Goose-sponsored show was canceled last-minute on Aug. 26 — and though he was initially announced as a performer for the 2017 MTV VMAs, he was a no-show Aug. 27 at The Forum in Inglewood, California.	1
"Tibrina Hobson/Getty  Demi Lovato threw quite the rager for her ""Sorry Not Sorry"" music video, and her party guests included several famous faces: Wiz Khalifa, Paris Hilton, and Jamie Foxx. This may seem like an unexpected group of celebrities, but nothing brings people together like neon lights, a kiddie-pool bubble bath, and a dance floor.  ""I wanted random people in my video,"" Lovato told MTV News correspondent Gaby Wilson this week, ahead of her VMA performance on Sunday. ""I wanted people to be like, what? Like, I wanted Bill Nye the Science Guy to be in it too, but I don't think he was available. Too cool for my video.""  Yep, that's right: Demi wanted to turn up with your childhood science teacher, but because she couldn't, she recruited the other celeb cameos via text messages. ""I thought Paris would be, like, awesome to be the DJ,"" Lovato explained. ""Wiz is a friend of mine — we go to the same gym — and then Jamie Foxx, I had just been over to his house for a party. And so I was like, I'd love for you to be in my video, and he is so freakin' funny, so having him in it was a blast.""  The party continues this weekend in Las Vegas, where Demi will belt out ""Sorry Not Sorry"" before DNCE take the stage with the legendary Sir Rod Stewart for a remote performance during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards. ""Sorry Not Sorry"" is up for Song of Summer, and the competition is especially fierce this year — Fifth Harmony's ""Down"" and Luis Fonsi's ""Despacito (Remix)"" with Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber are also contenders.  But whatever happens, it's good to know you always count on Demi to host a fabulous party.  The 2017 VMAs touch down at the Forum in Inglewood, California, on Sunday, August 27 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.

"This article originated from Den of Geek UK.  Contains spoilers for all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films up to and including Ant-Man and the Wasp and Avengers: Infinity War.  The Marvel Cinematic Universe is full of household names--some pre-established and some that the studio made themselves. This is a franchise with so much star power that even small roles are taken by the likes of Glenn Close and John C. Reilly. Which is its own special kind of shame.  Still, to maintain this level of impressive casting over its long-form storytelling style, Marvel Studios gets most of its cast members on multi-film contracts. We did some digging to find out how many films everyone has left. Where official information is available, we've used that as a source. We've tried to fill in the gaps with our own guesswork. We'll keep this incredibly long list up-to-date as we learn more.  Of course, based on the ending of Avengers: Infinity War, predicting who will be back and when is becoming more and more difficult. Especially because, well...half of everyone is dead.  The Avengers  ROBERT DOWNEY JR.  Tony Stark / Iron Man  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (cameo), Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  The first superhero that Marvel Studios presented us with was Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark – a casting masterstroke that would become the benchmark for all future Marvel heroes. At the moment, RDJ is only scheduled for Avengers 4 which could potentially write him into super-retirement. Could he continue as a consultant past that point?  further reading: Avengers: Endgame Trailer Breakdown and Analysis  Well, Marvel would probably need to renegotiate.  CHRIS EVANS  Steve Rogers / Captain America  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World (cameo), Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming (cameo), Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  It’s widely known that Chris Evans has expressed an interest in departing superheroics to focus on film directing instead. More recently though he's been speaking openly about being up for anything that Marvel want to do with Cap, even though he says he views Avengers: Endgame as a sort of sendoff to his performance.  CHRIS HEMSWORTH  Thor  Films appeared in so far: Thor, The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  Despite not appearing in Civil War, Thor actor Chris Hemsworth was still very much in the Marvel fold. And after Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War he can finally be considered an MVP.  further reading - Thor: Ragnarok Complete Easter Egg and Reference Guide  At the moment, all we know about is Avengers 4. Maybe one day he'll pass on the hammer to someone else, but that won't happen any time soon, as he has expressed interest in doing a Thor 4 past his current contract, complete with a possible return of Taika Waititi as director.  MARK RUFFALO  Bruce Banner / The Hulk  Films appeared in so far: The Avengers, Iron Man 3 (cameo), Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  Mark Ruffalo has made no secret of the six-film deal that Marvel has him on. Seeing as cameos don’t count towards that, he still has two films left, making him among the few stars of the original Avengers movies who is on the hook for continuing past ""Phase 3"" and Kevin Feige's fabled Avengers 4 finale. This is all great news, however the solo movie is still not happening.  SCARLETT JOHANSSON  Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  There’s isn’t an official answer out there on how many Marvel movies Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow has left. She said her contract has ""morphed"" and ""mutated"" in recent years when Collider asked. We know that she'll be back for Avengers 4. Kevin Feige has now also (finally) confirmed a Black Widow solo movie is happening after Phase 3, complete with Cate Shortland of the greatly underrated Lore directing. So there seems to be an interest in getting Johansson to reup after her contract is up.  JEREMY RENNER  Clint Barton / Hawkeye  Films appeared in so far: Thor (cameo), The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  Jeremy Renner is believed to have a standalone Hawkeye movie on his contract, but that doesn’t seem very close to happening. We totally support his avenging though, which is handy because he is on board for Avengers: Endgame.  Further he will only have been in four MCU films in a non-cameo capacity after Avengers 4, and as the standard contract is (at least) six movies, we imagine he'll turn up for at least one more bullseye after 2019 since we haven't seen him since Captain America: Civil War's cliffhanger ending.  DON CHEADLE  James ‘Rhodey’ Rhodes / War Machine / Iron Patriot  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: End Game  Gwyneth Paltrow already let slip she's enjoying working with Don Cheadle on the set of Avengers 4. And since he survived Infinity War, well we have a good feeling about this.  ANTHONY MACKIE  Sam Wilson / Falcon  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None.  There is no word yet whether he will be involved in the Avengers: Endgame, but we imagine he will be. He almost certainly has more films left on his contract, as the standard deal is six movies (he'll have appeared in five after 2018). Mackie also previously joked about signing a contract for ""like 50"" movies. Then again, he did get a little dust in his eye (pardon the pun) in Infinity War.  ELIZABETH OLSEN  Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The Winter Soldier (cameo) Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None, but on Disney+...  It seems safe to assume she'll appear in Avengers 4 given that she is a fan favorite who has only appeared in three major films (plus they've already killed off one Maximoff). But time will tell, considering she died at the end of Infinity War. Then again, she already as a TV show in the works.  PAUL BETTANY  J.A.R.V.I.S. / The Vision  Films appeared in so far: As J.A.R.V.I.S.: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Age of Ulton. As The Vision: Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The exact length of Bettany's contract is unknown, but Infinity War left the character in a difficult place. However, Bettany let it slip to Collider that he is going to be involved in shooting Avengers 4. If he signed a new contract beginning with Age of Ultron, he also could conceivably be in at least two more Marvel movies after 2019. Assuming, you know, he gets better.  PAUL RUDD  Scott Lang / Ant-Man  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man and the Wasp  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  His days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. Instead Scott Lang will have to find something else to do in Avengers 4, especially after Ant-Man and the Wasp's cliffhanger left him stranded in the Quantum Realm while Hank, Janet, and (maybe) Hope were made dust in the wind.  Rudd has described his contract as ‘three-plus-plus’ deal, which should see him hanging around for quite a while.  EVANGELINE LILLY  Hope van Dyne / Wasp  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  Ant-Man and the Wasp sent Lilly's character Hope Van Dyne into full superhero mode before making her literal dust in the wind by the film's end. However, we know she already has a role in Avengers 4 thanks to her in costume joining a Marvel PSA for Puerto Rico on the Avengers 4 set. So... death is like a state of mind, we guess?  further reading: Ant-Man and the Wasp Reference Guide  CHADWICK BOSEMAN  T’Challa / Black Panther  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None, but we all know Black Panther 2 is happening.  Word on the street is that Chadwick Boseman has signed up for five films. And after his tremendous debut as a franchise lead in Black Panther, we imagine we'll be seeing him in more than just one film after Avengers 4. Death is but a door, time a window. He'll be back.  TOM HOLLAND  Peter Parker / Spider-Man  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Spider-Man: Far From Home (co-produced with Sony)  Tom Holland has said he signed a six-film contract, and we know that he will be with the Avengers until the end of Phase 3 at least. He also has one Homecoming sequel already in the can and while it is murky, it seems likely Sony and Marvel Studios will continue their collaboration into a third Homecoming movie. After that though the future is less certain for the wallcrawler since Sony and Marvel would have to come to a new deal.  ""Mr. Stark, I'm feeling much better."" Mark our words, it'll happen.  BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH  Doctor (Stephen) Strange  Films appeared in so far: Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok (cameo), Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed Upcoming Films: Probably Avengers 4 and Doctor Strange 2.  He is not officially confirmed for Avengers 4 yet, but as he has a stunt double listed on IMDb, we imagine it's a good bet to continue expecting the Sorcerer Supreme, especially as he likely signed the standard six movie contract (which was apparently a sticking point that led to Joaquin Phoenix backing out of the role).  They are officially working on Doctor Strange 2 too, so that's nice.  BRIE LARSON  Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel  Films appeared in so far: None  Confirmed upcoming films: Captain Marvel and Avengers 4  The Academy Award winning actress will be making her Marvel debut in her own (overdue) movie in 2019's Captain Marvel. However, that spring release is a prequel of sorts to most of the MCU, as it takes place in the 1990s. This likely means it will be a precursor of sorts to the conclusion of the Infinity crisis in Avengers 4, where Captain Marvel will cross paths with fellow Avengers.  further reading: Captain Marvel Trailer Breakdown and Analysis  Guardians Of The Galaxy  CHRIS PRATT  Peter Quill / Star-Lord  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: We'd Assume Something...  After the release of the first Guardians, Pratt told GQ that he's signed up for ""two more Guardians plus another couple.” Pratt has since featured in Guardians 2, and Avengers: Infinity War, and Guardians 3 was announced but then Disney (rather rashly) fired James Gunn because of a bad faith conservative smear campaign earlier this year. And after the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy elected to standby Gunn, well Disney decided to put Guardians 3 ""on hold."" Whether that means until the controversy dies down or indefinitely as a punishment for a cast standing by principle against corporate cowardice remains to be seen. Still, even if there is no Guardians 3, Disney and Marvel Studios are nothing if not practical, and we'd imagine that in addition to any possible Avengers 4 cameo, most of the Guaridans cast will appear in some sort of contractual supporting appearances down the road.  ZOE SALDANA  Gamora  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: ?  We imagine she'll be back for a cameo in Avengers: Endgame, but...well... you know. She also signed the letter all but demanding Disney rehire James Gunn. That didn't happen, so maybe Marvel Studios will be happy if she stays in the refrigerator?  DAVE BAUTISTA  Drax  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Heh, about that...  Dave Bautista is technically still contracted to appear in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. However, he has been the most vocal in his support of James Gunn, insisting that he is only working for a company he now considers ""nauseating"" because of that contract, and will ask to be let out of it if they don't use Gunn's previously completed Vol. 3 screenplay. Given that movie is on hold, we could see Drax staying dust or retiring offscreen after Endgame. He has since asked to appear in Gunn's next project across the street: Suicide Squad 2.      SEAN GUNN  Body of Rocket / Kraglin  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War (as Rocket)  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  One of the Guardians franchise's unsung heroes is Sean Gunn, who portrays the physical form of Rocket Racoon via motion capture and improvises a fair few lines. He also plays the Ravager-turned-Guardian Kraglin, noted for yelling “Captain’s gotta teach stuff!” in the first film.  The length of his Marvel contract is unclear, but he’s definitely back for Avengers 4. We wouldn't be surprised if he is done with Disney after that, which is a shame given his mo-cap, and non-mo-cap, performances added a lot of character to this sometimes sterile universe.  further reading: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Stan Lee Cameo Explained      BRADLEY COOPER  Voice of Rocket  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  Finding the right voice for Rocket was a difficult one, with various comedians, voice actors, and film stars all coming in to read test lines. In the end, Marvel went with Bradley Cooper, and we expect they got him on a long contract. At the very least, we'll hear his voice in the next Avengers movie. See above though about why he might be done with Marvel after that. If so, it's their loss.      VIN DIESEL  Voice of Groot  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War, Ralph Breaks the Internet (cameo)  Confirmed upcoming films: Hmmm...  As above, see here. Vin Diesel was set to return in Guardians 3. Beyond that is a mystery, and so are the exact specifics of his contract. There is no way they'll leave lovable teen-Groot to the weeds, and this is one we could definitely see Marvel having an easy time recasting if necessary, though we doubt it will come to that.  further reading: Complete Marvel Movie Release Schedule  POM KLEMENTIEFF  Mantis  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: ?  She appeared in the second Guardians and third Avengers movies, and was supposed to thus appear in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. But see above.  further reading - Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Complete Reference Guide  KAREN GILLAN  Nebula  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  ""I have so many plans for Nebula… I love Nebula,"" director James Gunn told Yahoo. ""To me, she’s the Boba Fett of the movie… She’s the one that you really dig because she’s the cool one that we need to get more of. I hope to God that we get a chance to see a lot more of Nebula.""  It was later confirmed to us that she'll be in Avengers: Endgame, which she damn well better since she'll be Iron Man's ride off of Titan. Depending on what happens with her and Thanos' arcs in that one, it could make sense for Guardians 3. Oh wait...      SYLVESTER STALLONE AND THE REST  Starhawk And The 'Original' Guardians of the Galaxy  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Sly Stallone debuted as Stakar Ogord--aka Starhawk--in Vol. 2 with a brief performance that culminated in a post-credits scene. Therein, Starhawk and his shiny friend Martinex (Michael Rosenbaum) met up with Aleta Ogord (Michelle Yeoh), Charlie-27 (Ving Rhames), Krugarr and Mainframe (the latter of whom is voiced by Miley Cyrus).  In the comics, this gang were the original Guardians team that existed before Star-Lord's team. In the film universe, they are Ravager faction leaders that used to be firm friends. They have plans to steal some shit, but it remains to be seen which film that will happen in.  ""My plan is to see more of him,"" director James Gunn told the Toronto Sun, talking about Sly's character, but he wouldn't be drawn on how/when this will shake out.  ""I’m not sure about him appearing in Vol. 3,"" Gunn said, ""We’ll have to see about that, but it’s our plan to see more of Stallone. Kevin [Feige, MCU overlord] and I are working on what is going to become of the Marvel Cosmic Universe and where it’s going to go. We plan to see the rest of them in the future.""  The ""rest of them"" he mentioned, presumably, are the Ravager chums that Starhawk met up with at the end. Color us intrigued.  further reading: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Post-Credits Scene Explained  Villains  JOSH BROLIN  Thanos  Films appeared in so far: The Avengers (cameo), Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron (cameo), Avengers: Infinity War  Upcoming Films: Avengers: Endgame  While there isn’t a specific number out there, it’s assumed that Marvel has Josh Brolin on one of Marvel's heftiest contracts. He’s dominate Phase 3, for sure. We mean, Marvel even promised, ""Thanos will Return.""  further reading: Avengers: Endgame - How Thanos Could Be Defeated  TOM HIDDLESTON  Loki  Films appeared in so far: Thor, The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None, but on Disney+...  He’s believed to be on a six-film deal, so we’d expect one more appearance. But either way, death proves to be a prety loose term considering he has his own TV show set-up on Disney's new streaming service.  SEBASTIAN STAN  James ‘Bucky’ Barnes / The Winter Soldier  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther (cameo), Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  He’s on a nine-film contract! Sebastian Stan has confirmed to Cinema Blend that he is in Avengers 4. That leaves four more movies on his contract. Could we be headed for Captain America: The Next Generation?      ELIZABETH DEBICKI  Ayesha  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Elizabeth Debicki's golden villainess (although, arguably, she did have an understandable motive for hating the Guardians) will obviously return at some point. Once her creation Adam [Warlock, one assumes] is cast, we'll add him to this list.  Where Marvel plans to slot them in remains a mystery.      KURT RUSSELL  Ego  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2  Confirmed upcoming films: None  He's immortal and a Marvel character, so there's every chance that Ego's death from Guardians 2 could be undone at some point. But as far as we know, there are no further Marvel films on Russell's slate right now.  MICHAEL KEATON  Adrian Toomes / The Vulture  Films appeared in so far: Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Micheal Keaton played Adrian Toomes, aka the Vulture, in Spider-Man: Homecoming. This could well be a recurring role, especially if Sony decides to resurrect its Sinister Six flick at some point. Given his positive reception and the post-credits stinger to Homecoming, we find it highly unlikely we've seen the last of Toomes in this universe.  further reading - Spider-Man: Homecoming Post-Credits Scenes Explained  WILLIAM HURT  General Thaddeus ‘Thunderbolt’ Ross  Films appeared in so far: The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  One of the big surprises of Civil War's cast was the return of William Hurt to the MCU. Since he played an important role in that film, he could well return again. The actual length of his contract is a mystery though.  further reading - Captain America: Civil War Reference Guide  ANDY SERKIS  Ulysses Klaue  Films appeared in so far: Avengers: Age of Ultron, Black Panther  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Andy Serkis' cuttlefish-hating baddie returned for a nasty supporting role in Black Panther. One that also appeared very final after Killmonger put two in his chest. It is Marvel, so anything is possible, but him getting bagged and tagged seemed like the end of the road for this former hobbit's journey.  further reading: Andy Serkis Black Panther Interview  MICHAEL B. JORDAN  Erik Killmonger  Films appeared in so far: Black Panther  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Marvel made waves when they announced that Creed star Michael B. Jordan would be joining the MCU to face off against Chadwick Boseman in Black Panther. The film saw Jordan will be reunite with his Creed and Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler. And honestly, we think he turned out to be the best villains Marvel ever produced. But some of that power comes in his final line about welcoming death over bondage. While, again, Marvel can undo most deaths, that one seemed too powerful to revisit. It seems pretty one and done to us.  DANIEL BRUHL  Helmut Zemo  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: Civil War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  He's still alive at the end of Civil War, so don't rule out a comeback for Zemo at some point. However, Bruhl hasn't let slip the details of his Marvel contract at this stage.  further reading: Captain America Civil War - Who is Zemo?  CHIWETEL EJIOFOR  Baron Mordo  Films appeared in so far: Doctor Strange  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Chiwetel Ejiofor played one of Stephen Strange's tutors in the mystical arts in the Doctor Strange movie, building up to a huge heel turn right at the end of the movie. That post-credits scene needs to be resolved at some point.  As it stands, though, Marvel has yet to find space for Doctor Strange 2 in its slate. If/when it's finally announced, we'll be sure to update this article.  further reading: Doctor Strange Ending Explained by Scott Derrickson  MADS MIKKELSEN  Kaecilius  Films appeared in so far: Doctor Strange  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The Hannibal star made the best of a not-particularly-great villain role in Doctor Strange, but if he has any Marvel plans beyond that, they're being kept under wraps. We wouldn't be surprised if he was a one-and-done baddie, to be honest.  further reading: Doctor Strange - Complete Reference and Marvel Easter Egg Guide  CATE BLANCHETT  Hela  Films appeared in so far: Thor: Ragnarok  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Blanchett played the Goddess of Death in Thor 3, and some sources are already suggesting that she might stick around for supporting villain duties in Infinity War. We'll keep you posted on that front, because she was a hammy good time in Thor, and her fate seemed ambigiuous as Asgard went boom, to say the least.  further reading: Thor: Ragnarok Ending Explained  FRANK GRILLO  Brock Rumlow / Crossbones  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  After Winter Soldier came out, Grillo told Collider this: “I have a multi-contract deal with Marvel. The movie was an origin film for that character. If you know the comic, he has a significant presence. So, knock wood. With Marvel, you can’t say very much, but I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll have some fun in the next few Marvel movies.”  Could he somehow bounce back despite the very explode-y events of Civil War? Time will tell, but it seems unlikely.  further reading: Frank Grillo and James DeMonaco Interview  MICHAEL CHERNUS  Phineas Mason / Tinkerer  Films appeared in so far: Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: None  A recognizable, if fairly minor, Spider-Man villain, Michael Chernus' (Orange is the New Black) Tinkerer will likely be on hand to help more baddies in the future.  BOKEEM WOODBINE  Herman Schultz / Shocker  Films appeared in so far: Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: None  He barely became the Shocker in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Marvel has to have bigger plans for this guy, right?  further reading: Who is the Shocker?  TIM ROTH  Emil Blonsky / The Abomination  Films appeared in so far: The Incredible Hulk  Confirmed upcoming films: None  They had him on a three-picture deal, but the lack of standalone action for the Hulk seems to negate the need for an Abomination return. Perhaps that could change one day, especially given that William Hurt returned for Civil War.  SAM ROCKWELL  Justin Hammer  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man 2, ""All Hail The King"" (short)  Confirmed upcoming films: None  “Ah! I was hoping to come back in one of the Avengers films and come after Gwyneth Paltrow, because that's what they set-up, that I was going to get revenge on Gwyneth for getting me arrested or something,” Rockwell told Vulture of a possible Marvel return.  “I could do a Cape Fear thing with Gwyneth. But they've got a lot of mojo in there already, so I don't know if they need another pirate like me in the mix there! [Laughs.] Maybe S.H.I.E.L.D. is the way to go.” We’d color this one as unlikely, in all fairness.  HUGO WEAVING/Ross Marquand  Johann Shmidt / Red Skull  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The First Avenger, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Hugo Weaving told Collider: “I [signed a multi-picture deal] for Captain America. I think the tendency, with those films, would be to probably not bring a villain back. […] And it’s not something I would want to do again. I’m glad I did it. I did sign up for a number of pictures and I suppose, contractually, I would be obliged to, if they forced me to, but they wouldn’t want to force someone to do it, if they didn’t want to. I think I’ve done my dash with that sort of film.”  We probably won’t see him again, then. The Red Skull was recast for Infinity War for a pretty final seeming cameo.  S.H.I.E.L.D. Personnel (and retirees)  SAMUEL L. JACKSON  Nick Fury  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man (cameo), Iron Man 2, Thor (cameo), Captain America: The First Avenger (cameo), The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron (cameo), Avengers: Infinity War (cameo)  Confirmed upcoming films: Captain Marvel  Samuel L. Jackson is confirmed to have a supporting role in the 1990s-set Captain Marvel, but after that... who knows?  further reading: Captain Marvel Behind-the-Scenes Photos and Video Reveal Nick Fury  CLARK GREGG  Phil Coulson  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, ""The Consultant"" (short), ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor’s Hammer"" (short), Thor, The Avengers  Confirmed upcoming films: Captain Marvel  As you already know, Coulson has been reprised by Clark Gregg in Agents Of SHIELD on TV. We'll meet a younger version of Phil Coulson in the 1990s-set Captain Marvel.  COBIE SMULDERS  Maria Hill  Films appeared in so far: The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Avengers: Infinity War (cameo)  Confirmed upcoming films: None  At the time of The Avengers, Smulders said she was signed on for “plus this one, seven more I think.” By our counting, she should have one film left by now. Two if her Infinity War cameo doesn't count.  Her next Marvel appearance is currenly unknown.  HAYLEY ATWELL  Peggy Carter  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The First Avenger, ""Agent Carter"" (short), Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man (cameo)  Confirmed upcoming films: None  With Peggy Carter dead in the modern timeline, it's not seeming likely that Hayley Atwell will return in any more big screen Marvel films. There could feasibly be more flashbacks, but there are no plans at present of which we know.  further reading: Agent Carter Producers Still Want to Bring Show Back  DOMINIC COOPER  Younger Howard Stark  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The First Avenger, ""Agent Carter"" (short)  Confirmed upcoming films: None  We’d wager that Marvel may have had Dominic Cooper on a one-film deal, seeing as they don’t seem to have plans to return to the WWII era on the big screen. His appearances on the Agent Carter TV series prove that he's game for more if Marvel is, however.  further reading - Captain America: The First Avenger Reference Guide  JOHN SLATTERY  Older Howard Stark  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man 2, Ant-Man (cameo), Captain America: Civil War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  How’s that for a gap between appearances? Marvel may not have John Slattery on a massive contract, but he could pop up again if Marvel delves into more flashbacks.  further reading - Captain America: Civil War Review  MICHAEL DOUGLAS  Hank Pym  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp  Confirmed upcoming films: None.  Michael Douglas appears to be dead at the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp, but we doubt it's the last we'll see of Dr. Pym.  further reading: Ant-Man Review  MICHELLE PFEIFFER  Janet Van Dyne  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man and the Wasp  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Michelle Pfeiffer is superhero movie royalty after appearing in Batman Returns and was more or less treated like it in her brief but memorable scenes from Ant-Man and the Wasp. In the superhero romp, she is Hank's long lost wife and Hope's long lost mother, who is rescued from the Quantum Realm where she's survived for 30 years. While it is left vague how she survived, the experience has left her clearly changed, complete with subatomic powers that allow her to heal the antagonistic Ghost of an agony that is killing her.  further reading: Ant-Man and the Wasp Review  Clearly Marvel has plans for Janet down the road, as does Ms. Pfeiffer. So that makes her supposed death at the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp seem like a mere technicality until we get more answers in another sequel.  HANNAH JOHN-KAMEN  Ghost  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man and the Wasp  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Technically a villain, but not really, Hannah John-Kaman's antagonist in Ant-Man and the Wasp was the first antagonist who was almost entirely justified in everything she did... nor did she ever actually do anything too irredeemable. It is why we cannot place her in the villain column, and we imagine neither will Marvel in the longrun. As a woman cursed with phasing powers because of her father's failed experiments (and maybe Hank Pym's arrogance?), she is spared a horrible death by Janet and parts way with the heroes as... well not enemies, at least.  further reading: Ant-Man and the Wasp Director Talks Post-Credits Scene  It would seem likely Marvel will not leave an anti-heroine around with a cool costume and powers. And hey, we don't know if she's dust or not!  EMILY VAN CAMP  Sharon Carter / Agent 13  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  ""They're just sort of planting the seed for this character,"" Van Camp told MTV. ""I think Marvel likes to sprinkle little bits of things for fans, and anyone who is a Captain America fan will know that Agent 13 is Sharon Carter.""  further reading: Captain America: The Winter Soldier Review  While she hasn't told the world how long her contract is, we'd expect her to be back multiple times.  AARON HIMELSTEIN  Cameron Klein  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The unsung hero of two Marvel films--he refused to launch the ships for Brock Rumlow in The Winter Soldier and got those Helicarrier’s ""full of people"" in Age of Ultron. Unsurprisingly, there’s no word out there on whether Marvel has signed Aaron Himelstein up for more appearances yet.  At the very least, Marvel could recruit him for TV. Or could he be a second-generation Coulson-alike, recruiting new heroes for the greater good in Phase 3? Okay, our S.H.I.E.L.D. speculation may have gone too far.  Supporting Stars  ANTHONY HOPKINS  Odin  Films appeared in so far: Thor: Ragnarok  Confirmed upcoming films: None  That scene in Ragnarok seemed pretty final, didn't it? Not unless he's just ""sleeping"" again. It's not like Odin has proven himself to be very forthright or trustworthy when it comes to sweating the details of things.  further reading: Thor: Ragnarok Review      SETH GREEN  Howard The Duck  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy (cameo), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (cameo)  Confirmed upcoming films: None  It's unclear if Seth Green is on any sort of official contract, but MCU overlord Kevin Feige was quoted as saing this this recently: ""You know, the fun thing about Howard is he shows up where you least expect him, so like who knows where he’s going to appear next?""  We'd expect those cameos to keep coming, then. He's like the waterfowl version of Stan Lee.  further reading: Howard the Duck Deserves Another Chance?  GWYNETH PALTROW  Pepper Potts  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Spider-Man: Homecoming (cameo), Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers 4  While her contract concluded with Iron Man 3, she and Marvel have clearly come to some amicable arrangements. After seemingly (and lamely) being written out off-screen in Captain America: Civil War, she appeared for a fan-pleasing cameo in Spider-Man: Homecoming and again in Infinity War.  NATALIE PORTMAN  Jane Foster  Films appeared in so far: Thor, Thor: The Dark World  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Natalie Portman didn't return for Thor: Ragnarok. In fact, Portman told The Wall Street Journal that she's ""done"" with Marvel altogether, as far as she knows. While a final cameo in Avengers 4 wouldn't be amiss, there does not appear to be much love lost in this relationship.  However, Joe and Anthony Russo would not comment if she died or not during the The Great Snap of 2018. So could she be in Avengers 4?  further reading: Vox Lux Review  JON FAVREAU  Happy Hogan  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: None  It came as a bit of a surprise to us--what with Jon Favreau's manifold other projects as an actor/director, including The Lion King remake--but Happy Hogan returned alongside Tony Stark in Spider-Man: Homecoming.  ZENDAYA  Michelle  Films appeared in so far: Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: Spider-Man: Far From Home  As the love interest to Tom Holland's Peter Parker, Zendaya's Michelle debuted in the 2017 solo Spidey flick. While a return is not official, she did sign on for a contract and has indicated that she is set to return for the untitled 2019 sequel.  further reading: Far From Home Cast Teases Clues  DONALD GLOVER  Aaron Davis  Films appeared in so far: Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: None  As the uncle of the kid who will become the second Spider-Man, we doubt we've seen the last of this lovable (and ever growing in popularity) actor, writer, musician, and all around pop culture renaissance man.  further readding: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Review  JUDY GREER / ABBY RYDER FORTSON  Maggie / Cassie Lang  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp  Confirmed upcoming films: None.  They were back briefly for the Ant-Man sequel, and you would think they would be Scott's first priority to check on after getting out of the Quantum Realm, but time will tell if they show up in Avengers 4. Or maybe they're dust too?  MARISA TOMEI  May Parker  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming  Confirmed upcoming films: Probably Spider-Man: Far From Home  You don't think we'll follow up on THAT ending? Hopefully her next scene will use music as well as her last.  WILLIAM SADLER  President Ellis  Films appeared in so far: Iron Man 3  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The MCU's POTUS has popped up on Agents Of SHIELD since debuting in Iron Man 3. He was also seen in a photo during The Winter Soldier. It doesn't sound like Marvel is finished with him yet then.  LUPITA NYONG'O  Nakia  Films appeared in so far: Black Panther  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The Oscar winning Lupita Nyong'o joined the MCU as Nakia, a Wakandan secret agent and patriot. It was one of several standout roles for women in that movie, and was a refreshingly meaty part in a blockbuster for Nyong'o, who has too often been cast as CG characters or voices. However, her continued involvement likely depends on Black Panther's in the MCU. But after the box office performance of Black Panther, it looks like a long continued role, indeed.  further reading: Black Panther: Complete Reference Guide  DANAI GURIRA  Okoye  Films appeared in so far: Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: Avengers: Endgame  As a general and head of the Dora Milaje, the serect service of Wakanda, Gurira keeps her record playing characters you don't want to mess with going. We already know she will fight alongside the rest of the Marvel heroes in Avengers 4.  further reading: Ryan Coogler Wanted Back for Black Panther 2  LETITA WRIGHT  Shuri  Films appeared in so far: Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Another breakout star of Black Panther is the young Letita Wright, who portrays the little sister of T'Challa and is by definition a princess of Wakanda. However, she is not defined by her royal lineage, but by being potentially the smartest genius in the MCU, and a woman who can give Tony Stark a run for his money. A tech whiz with Wakanda's vibranium, she plays Q to T'Challa's Bond, designing all of his weapons. If Marvel is smart (and they're not dumb...), she's on a long contract.  further reading: Is Shuri Alive in Avengers: Endgame?  MARTIN FREEMAN  Everett Ross  Films appeared in so far: Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Ah, now here is the almost certain heir apparent to Agent Coulson. After having a bit part as a CIA wiseass in Civil War, Martin Freeman was rather cleverly cast in the ""token"" role in Black Panther, and made the most of it. The odd chemistry between him and T'Challa makes Ross an almost certain lock for appearing in the eventual Black Panther sequel (there is no way he was on only a two-film contract), but we wouldn't be shocked if he starts popping up in all sorts of MCU movies after Phase Three ends, like the good ol' days of Coulson.  STELLAN SKARSGARD  Erik Selvig  Films appeared in so far: Thor, The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Age of Ultron  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The mighty Stellan Skarsgård told us exclusively that he's on a five-film deal with Marvel, and that he only has one more film to go as the scientist Erik Selvig (unless he and Marvel manage to negotiate an extension).  KAT DENNINGS  Darcy Lewis  Films appeared in so far: Thor, Thor: The Dark World  Confirmed upcoming films: None  At one point, we would have said Kat Dennings was a shoo-in for Ragnarok, now it appears unlikely she'll be returning to the MCU despite probably still having more movies on her contract.  JONATHAN HOWARD  Ian Boothby  Films appeared in so far: Thor: The Dark World  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Same as Dennings above.  JAIMIE ALEXANDER  Lady Sif  Films appeared in so far: Thor, Thor: The Dark World  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Jamie Alexander was invited to return for a one or two-day shoot for a cameo in Thor: Ragnarok but apparently could not make it work due to scheduling conflicts with her NBC series Blindspot. Talk about a fortuitous delay since if she had returned for Ragnarok, she would have been as blandly and unceremoniously killed off as the rest of the Warriors Three. Kevin Feige has even mused that it leaves the fate of Sif open to revisiting in a later sequel. Sometimes delays are our friends.      IDRIS ELBA  Heimdall  Films appeared in so far: Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Well...you know how this one ends.      JEFF GOLDBLUM  Grandmaster  Films appeared in so far: Thor: Ragnarok  Confirmed upcoming films: None  The Grandmaster is chums with The Collector in the comics. In the movies, all we know is that he's played by Jeff Goldblum, he looks amazing, and he orchestrates the bout betwixt the Hulk and Thor. No clue if Goldblum signed up for more.  further reading: Jeff Goldblum's Summary of Thor: Ragnarok  TESSA THOMPSON  Valkyrie  Films appeared in so far: Thor: Ragnarok  Confirmed upcoming films: none  This Creed star made a huge splash in Thor: Ragnarok, playing an ancient warrior woman who also had a touch of Han Solo scoundrel in her demeanor.  further reading: Tessa Thompson on Rematch with Chris Hemsworth  GLENN CLOSE  Nova Prime  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy  Confirmed upcoming films: None  There wasn't space for Nova Corps in Vol. 2 in the end, and it remains to be seen if/when Glenn Close and her cohorts will return to the MCU.  JOHN C. REILLY  Rhomann Dey  Films appeared in so far: Guardians of the Galaxy  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Since Nova's involvement in the MCU going forward is unclear, we've no idea what the chances of John C. Reilly returning are.  BENICIO DEL TORO  The Collector  Films appeared in so far: Thor: The Dark World (cameo), Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: none  Is...is he dead?      MICHAEL PENA / T.I. / DAVID DASTMALCHIAN  Criminal Trio  Films appeared in so far: Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp  Beyond Ant-Man and the Wasp...we have no idea.  TILDA SWINTON  The Ancient One  Films appeared in so far: Doctor Strange  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Swinton's first MCU appearance came in Doctor Strange. It might also be her last, barring a resurrection or a dream sequence or some sort of magic vision thingy.  RACHEL MCADAMS  Christine Palmer  Films appeared in so far: Doctor Strange  Confirmed upcoming films: None  If Doctor Strange 2 does happen (which it surely will, eventually), we'd expect Rachel McAdams to return. She's not disclosed her contract details publicly.  BENEDICT WONG  Wong  Films appeared in so far: Doctor Strange, Avengers: Infinity War  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Will Wong return for Avengers 4? It's no clear yet. We imagine he'd be back for Doctor Strange 2, too.  further reading: Avengers 4: The Best and Worst Theories  Extreme long shot potential returnees  TIM BLAKE NELSON  Samuel Sterns  Films appeared in so far: The Incredible Hulk  Confirmed upcoming films: None  This bumbling scientist was meant to become The Leader, but never did. Tim Blake Nelson signed a three-picture deal to transform into said supervillain. That arc was pretty much written out in The Avengers' tie-in comic Fury’s Big Week though.  TY BURRELL  Leonard Samson  Films appeared in so far: The Incredible Hulk  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Hulk’s psychiatrist becomes a hero in his own right in the comics. At this stage though, if Marvel make another Hulk movie, it’ll probably be a clean slate supporting cast wise. William Hurt made a comeback, however, so who knows? Burrell is surely on a multi-film contract like Tim Blake Nelson.  LIV TYLER  Betty Ross  Films appeared in so far: The Incredible Hulk  Confirmed upcoming films: None  Her father Thunderbolt Ross returned for Civil War, but the fact that Marvel has now paired Bruce up with Natasha has us fairly confident that we won't see Betty Ross return. The length of her contract was never announced publically, but you can bet that Marvel had anticipated at least one The Incredible Hulk sequel for her.  Marvel could make a pretty decent movie with all the actors they have on multi-film deals that will never be used, couldn't they? Let us know if we've missed anyone important off this list. We'll do our best to keep it updated."	0
Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are moving fast, and a shocking Jan. 31 report claims that the couple is not only ready for marriage, but that Selena is EXPECTING! So is she going to walk down the aisle as a pregnant pride?! Get all of the crazy details right here.  Selena Gomez, 24, is pregnant with The Weeknd‘s baby, sources claim to Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 13 issue. OMG! “Selena is crazy about The Weeknd, 24, and has told pals that he’s the one,” one insider tells the mag, adding that the “Heart Wants What It Wants” singer has been experiencing cravings. “She’s [dropped] several hints that she’s expecting, complaining to those close to her that she’s too tired to stay out and that she feels nauseous. When she’s not nauseous, though, she’s having weird cravings, and she can’t stop eating ice cream!” That certainly does seem a little fishy.  It sounds kind of nuts, but friends say that Selena “can’t wait to have a child of her own”, according to the report, and she’s constantly telling friends “how much she wants to be a mom”. Selena also isn’t concerned about having kids at a relatively young age, as insiders claim to the mag: “Her own mom [Mandy Teefey] had her at 16, and Selena thinks her mom did a great job, so being a young mom has never been an issue.”  This is a lot to take in, and of course we’re wondering if Selena is nervous about these dramatic changes in her life. Well, yes and no! “She is excited,” a source shares with Life & Style. “She has always talked about having a little girl.”  Finally, if Selena and The Weeknd do get married, one thing’s for sure: it’ll be spectacular. “As far as weddings go, Selena wants to do something dramatic and different,” an insider reveals to the mag. “She has talked to friends about everything from an African safari wedding to a tropical Mexican wedding.” Sounds amazing!  HollywoodLife.com has reached out for comment.  HollywoodLifers, do you think it’s too soon for Selena and The Weeknd to get married and start a family together?	1
"Movie  Report says that the 'How to Be a Latin Lover' actor is currently in talks to play the reality show star in a possible movie based on her new memoir 'The Secrets of My Life'.  Jun 8, 2017  AceShowbiz - Caitlyn Jenner new memoir ""The Secrets of My Life"" reportedly will be adapted into a movie, with ""How to Be a Latin Lover"" actor Rob Lowe reportedly in talks to play her. A source told OK! that the actor would be interested to portray the Olympian-turned-transgender reality show star.  ""Rob’s been hunting for an awards-caliber movie part. This would be a game-changer for him,"" a source told the magazine. The insider went on saying that Caitlyn had sent Rob a copy of her book and that ""they've met up a few times to discuss it."" The source added, ""She thinks he's got what it takes to play both her and her former self, Bruce, and now Rob's throwing his weight behind the project as well.""  However, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply ""not true."" A rep for Rob tells the site that ""he hasn't met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic."" Caitlyn simply said in an interview that Rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film, but the idea hasn't been brought into real life yet. As for the memoir itself, there hasn't been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie.  Caitlyn's 320-page memoir ""The Secret of My Life"" was published last April and chronicled her life as well as revealed some intriguing truths about her past. One of them was the claim that her ex-wife Kris Jenner actually knew about her gender issue during their then-marriage.  ""I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her,"" wrote Caitlyn. ""This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn...I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did, because I did it several times in front of her after we were married,"" she claimed."	1
"Michelle Obama and Barack Obama might be two of the most-missed former residents of the White House. Even though Obama's presidency ended over a year-and-a-half ago, the couple known for being #relationshipgoals has recently come back into the spotlight. With Obama's 57th birthday on Saturday, Aug. 4, Michelle took to social media to wish her husband a happy birthday with a sweet post about him. Michelle Obama wished Barack Obama happy birthday with a thoughtful photo and message to Obama on Instagram.  Like any good significant other in the age of technology, Michelle made sure that she wished Obama a happy birthday on social media. The photo of Obama on Instagram and Twitter is accompanied by a short caption, but Michelle did anything but phone it in on this one. She posted what looks like a personal picture of Obama looking deep in thought as he overlooks a desert, and she wrote,  Happy birthday @BarackObama! The view is always better with you.  OK, you can now add ""expert at writing captions"" to Michelle's resume. I mean, c'mon, that post is sure to bring a smile to Obama's face when he sees it. Would you really expect anything less from this couple, though?  These two have proven time and again that they know how to keep their relationship going strong. Just look at their date night on the weekend of July 28, when the couple attended Beyoncé and JAY-Z's OTR II tour in Maryland. Not only did they make time to spend together at the show, but they spent that time doing what you should be doing at a Beyoncé concert: dancing! Seriously, the Obamas showed that they know how to move to the music, and the lucky concertgoers around them caught it all on video — but beware to get all the FOMO when you watch it.  When it comes to birthdays, though, it really isn't shocking that Michelle knocked it out of the park with this post. Her short and sweet caption about how ""the view is always better"" with Obama is such a thoughtful message to her husband. The swoon-worthy birthday posts must be a hallmark of their relationship, because Obama also shared an IG post to his better half on Jan. 17 to celebrate Michelle's big day. He wrote,  You're not only my wife and the mother of my children, you're my best friend. I love your strength, your grace, and your determination. And I love you more each day. Happy Birthday, @MichelleObama  It's not only birthdays that bring out the sweet messages from this couple, though. Obama also wrote Michelle a Valentine's Day post on Feb. 14 that said she makes ""every day and every place better."" I'm inclined to agree with the former POTUS on that one.  Really, there is no shortage of examples of how these two celebrate and lift each other up on the most special days in their lives. I would like to imagine that they are also they kind of couple that leaves little love notes for each other around the house on a daily basis.  Of course, I don't know if that's how the Obamas roll, but I do know they've perfected the art of the social media birthday post. Hopefully Obama is brainstorming Michelle's post for January!"	0
"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Weiner looked sombre as he left US Federal Court following his sentencing  Ex-New York congressman Anthony Weiner burst into tears as he was sentenced to 21 months in jail for sending sexually explicit messages to an underage girl.  He pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor and agreed not to appeal against a prison sentence of 27 months or less.  Weiner, 53, quit Congress in 2011 over a sex scandal and was again exposed in his 2013 run for New York mayor.  His lawyers had asked a US District Judge for probation instead of jail.  But in sentencing Weiner, US District Judge Denise Cote said: ""This is a serious crime that deserves serious punishment.""  She also said Weiner ""has a disease. He has a compulsivity. Some say a sex addiction.""  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption As a New York City mayoral candidate, Anthony Weiner confronts a heckler  Acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H Kim said in a statement that Weiner ""asked a girl who he knew to be 15 years old to display her naked body and engage in sexually explicit behaviour for him online"".  ""Justice demands that this type of conduct be prosecuted and punished with time in prison.""  In addition to jail time, Weiner was sentenced to three years of supervised release, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office.  Weiner's lawyers contended the former politician had acted out of the ""depths of an uncontrolled sickness"" and was now seeking treatment.  In a letter to Judge Cote, Weiner said he felt ""profound"" regret for his crimes and that his misconduct had ""crushed the aspirations"" of his wife, Huma Abedin, and ruined their marriage.  Ms Abedin filed for divorce on the same day as her husband was found guilty in May.  She did not attend the sentencing, but asked for leniency on their son's behalf in a letter to the judge.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Anthony Weiner (L) and Huma Abedin split last year  The FBI began investigating Weiner last September after the Daily Mail reported that he had exchanged obscene messages with a North Carolina teenager.  The 15-year-old girl said he had asked her to undress on camera.  A month earlier, Ms Abedin announced she was separating from her husband after it emerged he sent a photo of himself in his underpants with his toddler son nearby.  The New York Post reported that Weiner had sent sexual messages along with the photo to an unidentified woman in 2015.  Once a rising Democratic star, he stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after a graphic image sent from his Twitter account went public.  Initially claiming his account was hacked, he eventually confessed to having lied.  Weiner also admitted indulging in explicit online exchanges with at least six other women and pledged to seek therapy.  He tried to revive his political career in 2013 by running for mayor of New York.  But his campaign imploded amid reports of further graphic online messages.  The investigation into Weiner's sexting case played a role in last year's 2016 presidential election, when authorities found emails on his laptop from Ms Abedin, who was a senior aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  A separate FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's private use of email while she was secretary of state was closed after officials said nothing incriminating was found."	0
"Black Panther is ruling Wakanda, the global box office and as of Tuesday, he is also the king of Twitter.  The Marvel Studios blockbuster ""Black Panther"" is the the most-tweeted about movie of all time, Twitter announced on Tuesday in statement. The film, which stars Chadwick Boseman and is directed by Ryan Coogler, has amassed more than 35 million tweets.  ""Black Panther"" Twitter chatter was loud enough to topple two other box office hits that held the title from a galaxy far, far away: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi.""  In January, Kendrick Lamar fired off what is now the most-retweeted ""Black Panther"" tweet ever when he posted to Twitter the track list to the film's soundtrack, which was curated and produced by the Grammy-winning rapper. ""Black Panther The Album 2/9,"" Lamar wrote in the tweet, which has now been retweeted more than 240,000 times.  Black Panther The Album 2/9 pic.twitter.com/MqhsEcj6iF — Kendrick Lamar (@kendricklamar) January 31, 2018  The film, which is Marvel's first to be directed by an African-American, opened to a record-breaking $201.8 million in North America last month. That's the largest opening for an African-American director ever.  Since then, ""Black Panther"" has gone on to take on the global box office by storm.  Related: 'Black Panther' to cross $1 billion worldwide in less than a month  It took only 26 days for ""Black Panther"" to crack $1 billion at the global box office, and since opening last month the film has been at the top of the box office five weeks in a row.  So far the film has made more than $1.1 billion worldwide.  The film also holds a 97% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, making it one of the best-reviewed comic book films in history."	0
Orlando Bloom celebrated his 41st birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio by attending the third race of the Formula E season in Marrakesh, Morocco on Friday.  The Lord of the Rings star came to do more than watching, as he got behind the wheel of one of the high-speed electric race cars.  Bloom might have been a touch star-struck as he suited up to take a photo with Alejandro Agag, founder and CEO of Formula E as well as legendary French Formula One driver Alan Prost.  The Brit went all out with the car racing themed birthday blowing out candles of his epic race car cake. Bloom celebrated his birthday with his father Colin at his side, who couldn’t have looked more proud, cheering his son from the sidelines.  Happy birthday Orlando!	0
Insiders in Senate Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office tell the Army Times that there might be an open spot “as early as next week” following the bombshell allegations leveled at Pelosi this past week.While the mainstream media continues to ignore Pelosi’s scandals, Breitbart reported on Thursday that “at least five men and one woman have complained about Pelosi making unwanted advances in the past, but it always got swept under the rug.”According to the publication, two sources have confirmed that they were “incentivized” to transfer out of her office — one with a promotion and one with a lump sum cash payment of $15,000.According to insiders, Pelosi “has determined that she has no choice but to step down, though she wholeheartedly denies the allegations.”Three of Pelosi’s accusers, all male, are former interns and pages, while the others worked as a clerical aide and a member of the cleaning staff..Pelosi has been attacking Roy Moore lately for his alleged consensual affair with a young woman, but was simply her covering up her own misdeeds with fake outrage.It’s time for that old bat to retire anyway, but it’s good to see her go sooner rather than later. Now it’s time for a Republican to take her seat.	1
"According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to ""process their thoughts"" instead of rushing through their day.  Prince Harry: ‘There Is Much More We Can Do’ To Promote Mental Health Awareness  Speaking at a panel event entitled “Encouraging Happy Young Minds” in Leeds, the prince suggested that young people need to take a moment to think things over before moving on. “I read recently that young people check their phones at least 150 times a day,” he said. “I’m sure we could all be more effective and efficient if we took a moment to process our thoughts rather than rush to the next one.”  Prince Harry, along with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have spearheaded new mental health campaign, Head Together, which has initiated important conversation around the country.  “I cannot tell you how pleased William, Catherine and I are that the dial seems to have shifted and that there is now a greater understanding, compassion and kindness for anyone who opens up about their struggles.  “But let’s not kid ourselves that the job is done – there is much more that we can do at every level to make conversations about mental health as commonplace as those about physical health.”  Mental health awareness is a subject close to his heart. Harry had earlier this year admitted to undergoing counseling to cope with the loss of mother Princess Diana."	0
"Kevin Hart has become an 'amazing' husband after his cheating scandal last year 'because I get it now.'  The hunky 39-year-old took to People magazine to shower praise on his 34-year-old second wife Eniko for forgiving him.  'I applaud my wife for just displaying a high level of strength that I can’t even explain,' said Kevin, who shares infant son Kenzo with Eniko.  Looking back: Kevin Hart has become an 'amazing' husband after his cheating scandal last year 'because I get it now'; he is pictured with his wife Eniko Parrish  'I applaud her for being my backbone, my support system, and more importantly, taking my life to the next level,' he gushed.  When he cheated on Eniko during her pregnancy, setting off a massive public scandal, his relationship with his wife was 'put to the test.'  Kevin claimed that video footage of his indiscretion was being used for extortion purposes - though Montia Sabbag, the purported other woman, has denied involvement in such a plot.  Getting through it: The hunky 39-year-old took to People magazine to shower praise on his 34-year-old second wife Eniko for forgiving him  'It’s the most difficult test ever,' he said of the strain on his marriage. 'And, you know, sometimes those tests come from stupidity. But it’s how you handle it, and how you decide to move forward from it.'  The comedian added, 'The friendship that I have with my wife is insane. Yes, that’s my wife, we’re lovers, it’s a relationship, it’s marriage…but the friendship we have is like no other.'  And he said he is now an 'open book.'  Hart explain: 'I’m not talking about outside your home, I’m talking about inside your home.'  Grateful: 'I applaud my wife for just displaying a high level of strength that I can’t even explain,' said Kevin, who shares infant son Kenzo with Eniko  'When you get to a point to where you’re that open, and you’re that understanding, and knowing of one another, the word ""friendship"" is a real word, you know, that word ""best friend"" is a real word,' said the movie star.  Kevin, who shares 13-year-old daughter Heaven and 10-year-old son Hendrix with his first wife Torrei Hart, married Eniko in 2016.  Reflecting on his and Eniko's romance, he said: 'The tests we’ve passed made us love each other even more. It made us understand our bond even more.'"	0

Justin Bieber hit a paparazzo with his car Wednesday night after leaving City Church in Beverly Hills, police confirm to PEOPLE.  Lt. Scott Dowling of the Beverly Hills Police Department tells PEOPLE the accident occurred outside the Saban Theater at 9:24 p.m. According to Lt. Dowling, the victim, identified as Maurice Lamont, suffered non-life threatening injuries and was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to a source on the scene, Bieber, 23, was trying to drive away from the church but a slew of photographers was at the end of the driveway. “He tried to scare away the paparazzi but as he neared the group, he accidentally hit one of the photographers who was in his path,” the source tells PEOPLE.  Photos taken at the scene show Bieber got out of his car to check to see if Lamont was okay.  BACKGRID USA  Byrdman/BACKGRID  “Justin was surrounded by paparazzi leaving church services and accidentally grazed or came into contact with one of the paps surrounding his truck. To say he ‘ran over’ or ‘hit’ the guy is misleading and an overstatement and implies something much more grave than what happened,” a source close to Bieber tells PEOPLE.  “Justin immediately stopped, called 911 himself, stayed with the guy and the police, fully cooperated and as I understand it, was released from the scene without citation.”  A rep for Bieber had no comment.  All Access/SPW/Splash  All Access/SPW/Splash  Also pictured at the scene: Bieber’s former fling Kourtney Kardashian, who occasionally attends the church as well. The reality star enjoyed dinner at Craig’s before heading over to the theater, and was photographed going to her car after Bieber’s accident.  Juliano/X17online.com  On Thursday, Lamont gave his version of events via Instagram, straight from his hospital bed.  “Hanging in there everybody … Hour before my birthday hits, I get ran over by Justin Bieber. Isn’t that something? He’s a good kid, though. I think the truck was a little bit too big for him though ’cause there’s no way he could see over the front — the slope it was on.”  He added, “But like I said: He got out, he was compassionate, he’s a good kid, accidents happen. Hopefully everything works out here. Getting ready to go into X-ray right now!”  RELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Focusing on ‘Being Spiritual and Attending Church’ After ‘Disappointing’ Decision to Cancel Tour: Source  Earlier this week, a rep for the singer revealed the singer was canceling the remaining dates of his Purpose World Tour “due to unforeseen circumstances“; following the announcement, Beliebers around the world unleashed tweets voicing their frustration.  A friend of Bieber’s told PEOPLE why the “Sorry” singer needed a break from his grueling schedule on the road.  “He didn’t feel like he could give the rest of the tour as much energy as his fans deserve,” says the friend of Bieber’s decision to call it quits. “He is a perfectionist and didn’t want to disappoint fans with some half-ass performance. He thinks his fans deserve and should expect the same performance at the end of the tour as in the beginning. He just didn’t have that passion right now.

"Lindsey Caroline Vonn (née Kildow ; born October 18, 1984)[1] is an American World Cup alpine ski racer on the US Ski Team. She has won four World Cup overall championships—one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Pröll—with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010,[2] plus another in 2012.[3] Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman.[4] She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008–2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009–2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010–2012). In 2016, she won her 20th World Cup crystal globe title, an all-time record among men or women, passing Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, who won 19 globes from 1975 to 1984. She has the second highest super ranking of all skiers, men or women.  Vonn is one of 6 women[5] to have won World Cup races in all five disciplines of alpine skiing—downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom and super combined—and has won 82 World Cup races in her career through February 3, 2018. Her 82 World Cup victories are an all-time women's record, passing Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria who had held the record since the 1970s, and only Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden with 86 World Cup victories has more. With her Olympic gold and bronze medals, 2 World Championship gold medals in 2009 (plus three silver medals in 2007 and 2011), and 4 overall World Cup titles, Vonn is the most successful American ski racer and is considered one of the greatest ever.[6]  In 2010, Vonn received the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award [7] and was the United States Olympic Committee's sportswoman of the year.[8]  Various injuries have caused Vonn to miss parts of several seasons, including almost all of the 2014 season and most of the 2013 season. While recovering from injury, she worked as a correspondent for NBC News covering the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.  Early life and education [ edit ]  Born Lindsey Caroline Kildow in Saint Paul, Minnesota, she is the daughter of Linda Anne (née Krohn) and Alan Lee Kildow.[9] She grew up in the Twin Cities metropolitan area in Burnsville, Minnesota. She is of Norwegian ancestry.[10] Vonn was on skis at age two before moving into Erich Sailer's renowned development program at Burnsville's Buck Hill, which also produced slalom racer Kristina Koznick. Her father, who had won a national junior title before a knee injury at 18, ""pushed"" her very hard, according to Sailer.[11]  When Vonn was 10 years old, she met Olympic gold medalist ski racer Picabo Street, whom she considers her hero and role model. Their meeting made such an impression on Street that she remembered the meeting and later served as Vonn's mentor in skiing. Vonn commuted to Colorado to train for several years before her family moved to Vail, Colorado in the late 1990s.[12][13]  Vonn attended University of Missouri High School, an online program through the university's Center for Distance and Independent Study.[14][15] She speaks German fluently.[16]  Skiing career [ edit ]  Early years [ edit ]  Vonn was taught to ski by her grandfather, Don Kildow, in Milton, Wisconsin.[17] Vonn began skiing as a child in Burnsville, Minnesota, at Buck Hill Ski and Snowboard, and through family vacations that included 16-hour drives from Minnesota to Vail. ""I would be in the back under a sleeping bag, and she'd be driving and singing along to some Eric Clapton tape,"" Vonn said in an interview.[citation needed] By the time Lindsey was 7, she had skied in Minnesota, Colorado, and Oregon year-round. When skiing in Colorado, she had lessons at Ski Club Vail (SCV), an alpine racing program (subsequently expanded and renamed Ski & Snowboard Club Vail) that taught, and still teaches skiers from ages 6 and up.[18][not in citation given] During her first year at SCV, Lindsey skied under ""Gravity Corps"" Ski Coach Colby S. Scudder, Vonn's only female coach, in Ski Club Vail's Gravity Corps ""pre-age-class"" program. The program was directed by Tom Krebs[19][not in citation given] who told the Gravity Corps coaches to not train the skiers inside gates, but instead to develop their all-mountain skiing skills and to develop their comfort in the fall line (the most direct route down a ski slope), while ensuring the kids were exposed to as much terrain as possible ""versatility and exposure to diverse challenging terrain"" was the directive.[20][not in citation given] At that time, the Gravity Corps pre-age-class skiing program consisted of multiple groups of 8–10 skiers; it was the only SCV venue open at the club to younger skiers who were not yet old enough to participate in official ""age-class"" USSA or FIS sanctioned events.  Lindsey and other members of her gravity Corps group, placed first, second and third, in Gravity Corps unofficial races in which all gravity corps skiers participated in one collective unofficial gathering. The race was set and run by Krebs, and directed as the only time gravity corps skiers should ""be in a race course"".[20][not in citation given] At the end of that first Vail season, Lindsey's mother asked if the coach thought Lindsey was a slow skier; the answer was an emphatic ""NO,"" Lindsey was most definitely NOT a slow skier. It was mentioned that if anyone ever said that Lindsey was slow, it was likely because that person was not recognizing that Lindsey was in a perpetual growth spurt and, that the person saying that Lindsey was slow was not considering that changes in Lindsey's height, affected her center of gravity, etc., and skiing confidence, and thus that person who described Lindsey as skiing slowly was not acknowledging the differences between a growing young male skier vs. a young female skier (who by the age of 11, stood at a much taller height than her peers) - which, in the SCV Gravity Corps Coach's opinion resulted in the devastatingly inaccurate ""slow"" comment. The words used by Colby S.Scudder were more colorful, and much less diplomatic. Based on Lindsey's newly confirmed speed,Lindsey and her mother asked about enrolling Lindsey into the older ""Age-Class"" program, which they said, had previously denied their enrollment request.  The coach supported the idea of skiing with ""age-class"" skiers. The next season, with the final approval of Director Chip Woods, Lindsey was enrolled into the ""age class program,"" under SCV Alpine ""technical skiing Coaches Reid Phillips, Chip Woods, Todd A. Rash and Gus Pernetz,etc., who collectively perfected Lindsey's early technical skills and began her SCV ""in gate"" training.[21][not in citation given]  In the late 1990s, Lindsey and her siblings and mother stopped commuting from Minnesota to Colorado and instead moved to Colorado to ski exclusively at Ski Club Vail. During her first SCV year in Vail, Lindsey and one of her sisters skied together in the same ""gravity corps"" SCV group, it was during that first season Lindsey and her family were contemplating if the entire family should move from Minnesota to Colorado. ""Vail was wonderful to me,"" Lindsey said, ""but I missed all the traditional things of childhood – sleepovers, school dances, making friends in a conventional way. Halfway through the second season, Lindsey's siblings also moved to Vail. ""Now all my brothers and sisters had left their friends for me. That was stressful on them. I felt so guilty.""[citation needed]  However, the move paid off because in 1999 Lindsey Kildow and Will McDonald became the first American athletes to win the ""Cadets"" slalom events in Italy's Trofeo Topolino di Sci Alpino.[22] In 1986, Lindsey's hero, Picabo Street, participated, but did not medal, in the same Topolino event.[22][23][24][not in citation given] In 1995 Lindsey first met Street in person, a few years later, ""Street said was stunned watching a 15-year-old Lindsey ski for the first time in 1999. She marveled at Vonn's knack for following the fall line. 'The faster she went, the bigger the smile she got on her face,' Street said. 'You can't teach somebody to love the fall line like that little girl loved the fall line.'"" [25]  After climbing through the ranks of the U.S. Ski Team, she made her World Cup debut at age 16 on November 18, 2000, in Park City, Utah.  In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France.  Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful.[26]  On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months.  In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event.[11]  Lindsey Vonn during a slalom race in Aspen in November 2006  At her second Winter Olympics in 2006, Vonn clocked the second-best time in the first practice run yet crashed in the second training run for the downhill race on February 13, 2006, in San Sicario, Italy; she was evacuated by helicopter to Turin and was hospitalized overnight. Despite a bruised hip and strong pains, she returned on the slope 2 days later to compete and finished eighth. The gritty performance earned her the U.S. Olympic Spirit Award, as voted by American fans, fellow Team USA athletes, former U.S. Olympians, and members of the media for best representing the Olympic Spirit.  Vonn earned her first ""big race"" medals with silver in both downhill and super-G at the 2007 World Championships in Åre, Sweden. A training crash before the slalom caused her a low-level ACL sprain to her right knee, ending her season 4 weeks early. Nevertheless, she finished third for the season in the women's 2007 World Cup disciplines of downhill and super-G.  2008–2010: Winning the overall World Cup for three consecutive years [ edit ]  In 2008, Lindsey Vonn won the overall World Cup title. She became the second American woman to do so, following Tamara McKinney in 1983. American Bode Miller won the men's title to complete the first U.S. sweep of the men's and women's overall titles in 25 years (McKinney and Phil Mahre in 1983). She also won the World Cup season title in the downhill and the U.S. Alpine Championships combined title (downhill & slalom), marking her best ski season to date. Vonn set a new American record for the most World Cup downhill victories with ten, winning at Crans-Montana, Switzerland, on March 8.  Vonn in March 2008  In 2009, Vonn repeated as overall World Cup champion, repeated as downhill champion and also won the season championship in super-G by winning the final race of the season. During the season, she broke Tamara McKinney's American record of 18 World Cup victories when she won the super-G at Tarvisio in February. Her nine World Cup wins also set an American single-season record, surpassing Phil Mahre's total of eight in 1982. At the 2009 World Championships in Val-d'Isère, France, Vonn won her first world championship and became the first American woman to win the world super-G title.[27] In the super combined event, she won the downhill portion and had appeared to have finished second in the event with a strong slalom performance, but was disqualified for splitting a gate.[28] Three days later she won the gold in the downhill. During early 2009, she appeared in Alka-Seltzer television commercials in the United States as support for the United States Ski Team. During the summer of 2009, Vonn switched her equipment sponsor and supplier to Head skis, after previously racing her entire career on Rossignol skis.[29] In October 2009, Vonn was awarded the Skieur d'Or Award[30] by members of the International Association of Ski Journalists for her performances during the previous season.  In December 2009, Vonn sustained a bruised arm after a crash during the opening run of the World Cup giant slalom. She continued racing as there was no fracture that would prevent her return and run at the Olympic Games in Vancouver.[31] Despite skiing with her arm in a brace due to the injury, Vonn won three straight races (two downhills and a super-G) in Haus im Ennstal, Austria from January 8–10, 2010. The wins raised her to second among American skiers on the all-time career list for World Cup wins with 28, passing Phil Mahre and trailing only Bode Miller. On January 14, 2010, Lindsey Vonn was named Colorado Athlete of the Year for 2009.[32] With her victory in a super-G just prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics, she clinched her second straight super-G discipline title with two races still to go.[33] Vonn ended up also winning the overall title, as well as the discipline titles in downhill, super-G and combined, and by winning the last super-G of the season, she boosted her overall World Cup victory total to 33, surpassing Bode Miller for the most World Cup victories by an American.[34] The third consecutive overall World Cup title also equals Phil Mahre's American record and makes Vonn the third woman to achieve it, behind Petra Kronberger with 3 straight and Annemarie Moser-Pröll with 5 straight.[34] Vonn was also named by the Associated Press as 2010 Female Athlete of the Year.[35]  2010 Winter Olympics [ edit ]  Vonn at the 2010 Arthur Ashe Kids Day in Queens , New York, August 2010  At the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Vonn planned to compete in all five women's alpine events.[36] On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week. Vonn said the pain from her injury was ""excruciating"" and she would have a difficult time competing at the Winter Olympics.[37] Due to unseasonably warm weather and resultant poor snow conditions, many of the Alpine skiing events were moved back, giving Vonn additional time to heal.[38] On February 17, in her first event, Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at Whistler Blackcomb, beating longtime U.S. rival Julia Mancuso by 0.56 seconds and becoming the first American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill.[39][40]  From left to right: Tina Maze of Slovenia (silver), Andrea Fischbacher of Austria (gold), and Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. (bronze) with the medals they earned in the super-G  In her second event, the super combined, Vonn finished first in the downhill portion of the race. In the slalom portion, however, she crashed when she failed to get her ski around a right-hand gate. Vonn said her shin wasn't the problem. Gold and silver were won by Maria Riesch and Julia Mancuso respectively.[41]  In her third event, the super-G, Vonn finished third behind Andrea Fischbacher and Tina Maze, 0.74 seconds behind Fischbacher's winning time.[42] Afterwards, Vonn said she didn't ski the last part of the course as aggressively as she could have and lost the race as a result.[43] In her fourth event, the giant slalom, fog affected visibility. Vonn crashed in her first run, resulting in a broken fourth finger and Vonn's disqualification from the event.[44][45] In her fifth event, the slalom, Vonn lost control and straddled a gate, disqualifying her from the event.  2011: Losing the overall World Cup to Maria Riesch by 3 points [ edit ]  Vonn at the Boston Red Sox vs. Baltimore Orioles game, April 2011  After 3 consecutive overall World Cups, Vonn faced more serious competition from Maria Riesch of Germany in 2011. Riesch had a strong start to the season by winning 2 downhills in Lake Louise, where Vonn had won 7 races. Vonn placed on the podium in every speed race but failed to finish in several slaloms. Riesch had 5 podiums in the first 6 slaloms and was significantly ahead in the overall ranking by the end of January.  At the 2011 World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Vonn suffered from a concussion she acquired during training a week earlier. She started in 2 events and achieved a seventh place in super-G and a silver medal in downhill.  Back to World Cup and healthy again, Vonn finished ahead of Riesch in several races (including a giant slalom she finished third, best career result in GS until then), she took overall lead for first time that season after downhill event of the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide. The super-G was cancelled due to poor weather conditions, and after the slalom Riesch regained the overall lead by 3 points. The giant slalom was also cancelled due to weather and Riesch was the 2011 overall champion.  2012: Joining the all-event winner's club [ edit ]  Vonn won her fourth Overall World Cup Title in 2012. The season opened in October in Sölden, Austria where Vonn won her first giant slalom. This made Vonn the 6th woman to have won all events at least once.  On December 2–4, 2011, she won all three races in Lake Louise (two downhills, one super-G) for her second career 'hat trick', and with her eleventh win at Lake Louise she surpassed Renate Götschl's record for most career wins at a single resort (ten in Cortina d'Ampezzo). On December 7, 2011, Vonn notched her first World Cup victory on U.S. snow, at Beaver Creek, Colorado. Due to a lack of snow in France, its super-G was rescheduled in advance for a Wednesday on the Birds of Prey course. Her limited success on U.S. snow is primarily due to a lack of speed events; only three have been run in the U.S. during her career. It was the first home win by an American woman in 17 years, since Hilary Lindh of Alaska won the downhill in nearby Vail in December 1994.  With further victories in January 2012, she overtook Renate Götschl to become the third most successful female World Cup racer in terms of victories.  On February 4, 2012, Vonn achieved her fiftieth World Cup victory on the Kandahar downhill course at Garmisch, Germany. The win also gave her 25 career downhill victories, surpassing Götschl for second most career DH wins. With a podium finish in Russia on February 18, 2012 Vonn clinched the season title in downhill, her fifth consecutive in that discipline.  Vonn's expressed disappointment that she missed the FIS Alpine Record for 2,000 points in a season by 20 points. In her final race of the season at Schladming, Austria, she was not able to improve on her first giant slalom run after losing her pole at the starting gate. Her 24th finish at Schladming led to her loss of a potential 20-plus points for her season record. ""It was possible to get those 20 points, I was in a good position ... If you work so hard to reach your goal but you lose your pole in the very last run, that's hard to take. It will give me even more motivation for next season"", commented Vonn after the race.[46]  2013 [ edit ]  Vonn got off to a slow start in the 2013 season, slowed by illness with marginal results in giant slalom and skipping a pair of slalom races in November 2012. She came back quickly once the speed events started, again sweeping all three races in Lake Louise from November 30 to December 2 (two downhills, one super-G) for her third career 'hat trick', and increasing her record for most career wins at a single resort to 14. The three wins increased her career total to 56, moving her past Vreni Schneider into second place all-time among women behind Annemarie Moser-Pröll with 62.  After some disappointing results, Vonn announced her decision on December 17 to take a break from the World Cup circuit to fully recover from her earlier illness.[47] She returned and finished in 6th place on January 6 in her first downhill race since her break. Two weeks later she won the downhill in Cortina d'Ampezzo and week later won the giant slalom in Maribor, Slovenia.[48]  World Championships [ edit ]  At the first marathon of the 2013 World Championships in Schladming, Austria, Vonn crashed in the super-G and was airlifted to a nearby hospital. She tore her anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in her right knee, with a tibial plateau fracture.[49] Vonn said she would be ready for the 2014 Winter Olympics despite her injury.[50]  World Cup Finals [ edit ]  Before her season ending crash on February 5 in Schladming, Vonn led in the World Cup downhill standings with 340 points. Several were within reach of taking the title during her absence from the tour. Overall champion Tina Maze, who trailed Vonn by more than a hundred points, took a 4th-place finish in Méribel and a win in Garmisch to close the gap to a single point with one race remaining at the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide. Weather conditions were in Vonn's favor, as officials canceled the race after numerous delays due to a thick fog on the lower section. As a result, she won her sixth downhill season title despite not competing in a downhill since mid-January.  2014 [ edit ]  Vonn traveled to Austria for the first race of the 2014 Alpine Skiing World Cup, but ultimately decided not to compete during the first weekend.[51] She announced plans to return to competition in late November.[51] On November 20, 2013, Vonn re-injured her right knee straining it and partially tearing her right ACL after a crash during training.[52] She returned to competition on December 6, finishing 40th the first of two downhill races in Lake Louise, Canada,[53] then 11th in the second downhill on December 7, followed by a 5th place in the super-G on December 8. In December, she said of her preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics that ""I'm going to play it safe and race minimal races, so I can get the confidence and the timing and the feeling of racing again. I'm really going to be safe and smart as I can.""[54]  On January 7, 2014, Vonn announced that she would not compete in the Sochi 2014 Winter Games because she had re-injured her right knee on December 21, 2013, while skiing in France. ""I am devastated to announce that I will not be able to compete in Sochi. I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level. I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February. On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold. Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially team USA!"" [55] ESPN posted a reference to her announcement, a few hours after Lindsey wrote the aforementioned on her Facebook page.[56]  2015: Comeback [ edit ]  Vonn made her comeback to the top of the podium on December 6, 2014 at the Women's World Cup downhill race at Lake Louise, Alberta, winning the event in only her second race back.[57] In January 2015, she tied and then overtook Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell for the most World Cup wins ever.  At the 2015 World Championships in Vail / Beaver Creek, Colorado, Vonn won a bronze medal in the first of ladies' events, the super-G.[58] She placed 5th in the downhill race and 14th in the giant slalom race.  On March 18, 2015, Vonn won the last World Cup downhill race at Meribel, France and claimed the World Cup downhill title for the seventh time. Vonn tied with Moser-Proell for the women's record of seven globes in one discipline.[59] The next day, Vonn notched her eight victory of the season by winning the last super-G race. With this win, Vonn took the super-G season title for a fifth time, tying a record shared by German Katja Seizinger, Austrian Hermann Maier and Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal. She joined Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark as the only skiers to reach 19 season titles across all disciplines and the overall. Vonn also made a World Cup podium for the 113th time, tying Moser-Proell‘s women's record.[60][61]  2016 [ edit ]  Vonn started the season by winning the three races contested by women in Lake Louise (2 Downhill, 1 Super G) for her third career victory. This brought her to 70 career World Cup wins, increasing her lead over the previous women's world record holder for most World Cup podiums by a woman (Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell, 62 career victories) and with her 25th Super G win, she passed Austrian Hermann Maier for most Super G wins for either gender.[62] In January, Vonn tied the record of Annemarie Moser-Pröll for all-time downhill victories at 36 with a win at Altenmarkt-Zauchensee, Austria. Because poor snow conditions resulted in a shorter course, the race was uniquely held over two combined runs, similar to slalom and giant slalom races. Two weeks later in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Vonn broke Moser-Pröll's record with her 37th downhill victory.  2017 [ edit ]  On November 11, 2016, Vonn announced on her Facebook page that she had severely fractured the humerus bone of her right arm in a training crash. She had undergone surgery to repair the bone.[63] Vonn returned to the World Cup on January 15, 2017, in the downhill race at Altenmarkt; she finished 13th. On January 20, in her second race back from injury, she won the downhill event in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, capturing her 77th win.[64]  On December 8, 2017, Vonn stated in an interview she will not be representing the President in the 2018 Winter Olympics and will not attend the White House reception if she wins a gold medal. Vonn made it clear in her statement that she feels that all Olympians represent the United States people, and not the leaders. She was quoted in the CNN article saying, ""Well I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the President."" [65]  2018 [ edit ]  2018 Winter Olympics  At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Vonn tied for 6th in Women's Super-G.[66] She won the bronze medal in women's downhill.[67] Vonn dedicated her Olympic races to her grandfather, a Korean War veteran who died the previous November, competing with his initials on her helmet.[68] In a tearful interview following the woman's downhill race, Vonn stated: ""Our family never gives up and I never gave up. I kept working hard and I'm really proud of this medal and I know he [her grandfather] is too.""[69][70] She later scattered some of her grandfather's ashes near the men's downhill racing course, stating: ""I know that it would mean a lot to him to be back here, a part of him is in South Korea always."" [71]  2019 [ edit ]  In October 2018, ahead of the start of the 2018–19 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, Vonn announced that she would retire from competition at the end of the season. Having previously suggested that she would continue until she had broken Stenmark's record for World Cup race victories, she confirmed that she would retire in 2019 regardless of whether she managed to surpass Stenmark's tally or not, explaining that ""physically, I've gotten to the point where it doesn't make sense... I really would like to be active when I'm older, so I have to look to the future and not just be so focused on what's in front of me"". She also said that she aimed to compete in all downhills and super-Gs in the World Cup season, planning to make her debut at Lake Louise at the end of November.[72] However the following month she injured her knee whilst training at Copper Mountain, forcing her to pull out of the Lake Louise races.[73]  Personal life [ edit ]  Vonn has enjoyed a significant amount of media attention for an alpine skier, making her the face of her sport in the US. She has appeared on The Today Show, Access Hollywood, and The Late Show with David Letterman and has picked up endorsements from notable companies such as Head, Oakley, Red Bull, Rolex, and Under Armour.[74] In 2010, her assets were estimated to be worth over 2.5 million dollars.[citation needed]  Vonn in March 2010 with 8 crystal globes, including 3 large ones for FIS World Cup overall titles and 5 smaller ones for various discipline titles  Vonn married fellow 2002 Olympian and former U.S. Ski Team athlete Thomas Vonn on September 29, 2007, at the Silver Lake Lodge in Deer Valley, Utah.[75] In November 2011, the couple announced initiation of divorce proceedings after four years of marriage.[76] The divorce was finalized on January 9, 2013.[77]  Vonn met golfer Tiger Woods at a charity event in 2012. They started dating in March 2013 before splitting in May 2015.[78][79][80]  Vonn frequently stays at the home of Maria Höfl-Riesch, her friend and former major competitor, in Garmisch, Germany. Lindsey and Thomas Vonn often spent Christmas Eve at the Riesch family home. Vonn is fluent in German (including Austro-Bavarian).[81] During the off-season, Lindsey resides in Vail, Colorado. The most unusual of Vonn's trophies lives in Kirchberg, Austria—Olympe the cow. Vonn won the oversized pet in 2005 in Val-d'Isère.[82] Vonn's nicknames are ""Kildon"", ""Don Don"" and ""The Don.""  Though she makes many public appearances, Vonn says training takes up most of her life except for a few weeks after the ski season. She trains six to eight hours a day for six days per week during the summer, incorporating endurance cycling, tight-rope walking, and reaction training into her indoor regimen. She also spends a significant portion of her training regimen skiing, focusing on technical aspects and speed all year round.[83]  Vonn appeared in the 2010 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition which featured Olympians from the 2010 Winter Games.[84] She came in 59th on Maxim's Hot 100 list that year.[85] She appeared in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition again in 2016. This time she only wore bodypaint.  As of December 2017, she is in a relationship with Canadian ice hockey player P. K. Subban.[86]  World Cup results [ edit ]  Season titles [ edit ]  20 titles (4 overall, 8 downhill, 5 super-G, 3 combined)  Season Discipline 2008 Overall Downhill 2009 Overall Downhill Super-G 2010 Overall Downhill Super-G Combined 2011 Downhill Super-G Combined 2012 Overall Downhill Super-G Combined 2013 Downhill 2015 Downhill Super-G 2016 Downhill  Season standings [ edit ]  Season Age Overall Slalom Giant  Slalom Super G Downhill Combined 2002 17 93 — — 35 41 — 2003 18 118 — — — 47 — 2004 19 30 38 45 26 14 — 2005 20 6 28 35 3 5 5 2006 21 5 9 49 4 2 3 2007 22 6 37 — 3 3 7 2008 23 1 32 13 6 1 2 2009 24 1 3 8 1 1 2 2010 25 1 14 28 1 1 1 2011 26 2 19 12 1 1 1 2012 27 1 20 2 1 1 1 2013 28 8 — 20 4 1 — 2014 29 68 — — 25 36 — 2015 30 3 — 29 1 1 — 2016 31 2 43 18 3 1 5 2017 32 19 — — 12 4 — 2018 33 10 — — 9 2 10  Race victories [ edit ]  82 wins – (43 DH, 28 SG, 4 GS, 2 SL, 5 SC)  137 podiums, 213 top tens  World Championship results [ edit ]  Year Age Slalom Giant  slalom Super-G Downhill Combined 2005 20 — DNF1 9 4 4 2007 22 DNS1 — 2 2 DSQ2 2009 24 DNF2 — 1 1 DSQ2 2011 26 — — 7 2 DNS2 2013 28 — — DNF — — 2015 30 — 14 3 5 DNF2 2017 32 — — DNF 3 5  Olympic results [ edit ]  References [ edit ]  Quotations related to Lindsey Vonn at Wikiquote Media related to Lindsey Vonn at Wikimedia Commons"	0

April Rietze  It’s official!  Laura Bell Bundy, the actress, singer and Broadway star (she played Elle Woods in the Legally Blonde musical!) married Thom Hinkle, an executive at TBS. The two tied the knot during a country-themed ceremony in the infield at Santa Anita Park, a horse racetrack in Arcadia, California, on Saturday in front of family and friends.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  And like any true horse racing fan, she abided by a very festive dress code. Bundy chose a custom Sherri Hill gown that featured all-over lace, beading along the bodice, a strapless sweetheart neckline and a long, elegant mermaid-style train.  April Rietze  “I knew I wanted a dress that was more sexy and slinky than ‘Cinderella goofy’ or big,” Bundy tells PeopleStyle exclusively. “The dress is elegant with some beading detail and also has a simplicity to it which I wanted.”  RELATED PHOTOS: Cocktail Dresses You Can Easily Re-Wear During Wedding Season  Bundy visited Hill in her Atlanta showroom to design the gown in April and with just one fitting, received the dress by mid-May. “That was my only fitting before I got the dress — naturally, I was quite anxious,” Bundy says. “I received the dress on May 12th, and had it altered by the seamstress on the set of Good Behavior.”  As for her bridal accessories, she chose a floral wreath by the Crown Collective with a white veil flowing in the back. “I wanted to add more white to my look once I saw the neutral underlay on the dress,” the star explains.  Bundy wore Hey Lady pumps featuring floral details on the heels and earrings and bracelet by Brooke Worthington Jewelry.  Bundy announced her engagement on Dec. 31, 2015 by showing off her blinding ring in a heartfelt Instagram post writing that she knew Hinkle was the one when he “switched from Scotch to KY Bourbon.”  FROM COINAGE: Your Go-To Guide to Finding the Right Wedding Gift  She wrote: “He is my rock. My Partner. My Best Friend. My roomie. My champion. My greatest most fun challenge. My make-out Partner.

Selena Gomez reportedly walked out on Justin Bieber during their date night in Seattle.  A source told E! News that Gomez disliked the fact that Bieber’s dancing drew too much attention. Immediately after Gomez walked out of the venue, Bieber followed her, and they both returned to Los Angeles together.  The couple rode a private jet over the weekend to enjoy some quality time together. Another source told the same publication that the two are doing great ever since they started seeing each other again in October.  “Selena and Justin are doing great. Justin is very affectionate to Selena. He wears his heart on his sleeve lately especially when it comes to her. They are still learning about each other as grown adults,” the source said.  The same source claimed that Bieber and Gomez will be spending New Year’s Eve together since they won’t be able to celebrate Christmas together. However, nothing has been finalized as of late.  Another source told People last week that Gomez’s family doesn’t like Bieber for the “Wolves” singer that’s why she never invites him to attend their gatherings.  “Justin’s family always loved Selena, but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin. Selena doesn’t bring Justin to any family events. Selena is spending Christmas with her family. As of now, Justin is not invited,” the source said.  Gomez and Bieber dated on and off from 2010 to 2015. The two rekindled their romance after she underwent kidney transplant. Following her split from The Weeknd, Bieber and Gomez started hanging out more frequently. Last month, they were also photographed kissing each other on the lips.  While speaking with Billboard, Gomez also said that she’s more mature now to know who is good for her.  “I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean caring for someone ever goes away. And that goes for people in general,” she said.	0
NEW YORK (AP) — Jada Pinkett Smith is calling the Tupac Shakur biopic “All Eyez on Me” ″deeply hurtful” for its portrayal of her relationship with the rap legend.  In a series of tweets Friday, just as the film is opening in theaters, Pinkett Smith contradicted several scenes. She said she never had an argument with Shakur backstage, that their parting was fictionalized and that he never read her a poem, as seen in the film. Pinkett Smith said her relationship to Shakur was “too precious” for her not take issue.  Pinkett Smith was close friends from childhood with Shakur. She’s portrayed in the film by Kat Graham, whose performance Pinkett Smith complimented, along with Demetrius Shipp Jr., who plays Shakur.  The filmmakers of “All Eyez on Me” didn’t immediately comment Friday.	0

Sara Gilbert.  Nearly a week after ABC canceled Roseanne following the star’s racist tweet, co-star Sara Gilbert spoke on her other show, The Talk, about the sitcom’s end. Gilbert was an executive producer on the revival and one of the driving forces to get it to happen. She was one of the first to speak out on Twitter against Barr’s tweet last Tuesday, before ABC canceled the series. “In addition to my statement, I would like to say this has been a very difficult week,” Gilbert said. “A lot of people have been hurt by this. I will say I’m proud of the show we made. This show has always been about diversity, love, and inclusion. And it’s sad to see it end in this way. I’m sad for the people who lost their jobs in the process. However, I do stand behind the decision ABC made.”  ABC is reportedly looking into ways to reformat Roseanne without its star, including a show possibly centered on Gilbert’s character Darlene, though Gilbert and the network haven’t commented on those reports.	0
How to perform a Satanic Destruction Ritual  Photo by Levan TK (LA Weekly).  I’ve come to learn that rituals are treated very similarly to masturbation in society. It’s something everyone does (whether they like to admit it or not), we’re told to be ashamed of their practice, but they both make us feel good. Rituals are a very personal thing, and seldom understood writ large. If you’re out with people and you tell them you did a ritual earlier that day, odds are you’ll be met with the same response as if you told them you jerked off that morning.  What are rituals?  The truth is, that all of human life is made of rituals.  Mere mention of the word generally conjures images of occult symbols painted on the walls of decrepit basements, animal sacrifice, and strange chanting that reverberates off the walls of horror film scenery and news headlines to assault the American imagination. However, rituals are a universal feature of human cognitive function and social structure. It’s time we reevaluate what the meaning of a ritual is, and recognize the potential (dare I say) benefits of doing such things — specifically here the Destruction Ritual.  Rituals have a strange role in my life. Coming from an academic background in anthropology, the anthropological definition is engrained in my mind. The formal definition in that field is:  “Rituals are actions with intentional symbolic meaning undertaken for a specific cultural purpose, such as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, and may reinforce broader community social bonds, as in a wedding. They are used to reinforce social bonds and structure.”  Traditional Oriya Wedding Ceremony in India is a right-of-passage ritual practiced by those of the Hindu faith to ceremonialize the union between two people.  Communion is a Christian ritual in which bread and wine are consumed to symbolically represent the body and blood of Christ being consummated and taken into his worshippers.  New Year’s Eve ritual practiced by Americans in New York every year on January 31st at Midnight in which a giant ball is “dropped” from the top of Time Square and confetti is released to celebrate the arrival of another year.  I’m also a chapter head for The Satanic Temple, so writing and performing rituals has become a foundational and therapeutic practice for me. For the last few years, I’ve found myself straddling a line between scientific objectivism and emotional catharsis with the subject.  Rituals are repeated human actions to fulfill, reinforce and maintain a part of the human function and experience. Brushing our teeth is a ritual created to tend to our dental health. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are daily rituals to tend to our caloric intake. Prayer before bed, meals or at church every Sunday is a ritual to tend to piety and relationship with God. Going to the gym is a ritual to tend to maintenance of our muscular and cardiovascular systems. But why don’t gym bags, toothbrushes and Eggo waffles send people running for the hills?  The media-driven Manson case heavily polluted the concept of rituals in America.  The media has heavily slandered the practice of rituals. The taboo has gone so far in the U.S. as to compelling hundreds of police departments nationally to create specific manuals for identifying Satanic rituals and effectively “busting” anyone caught doing them. This has had devastating side effects on our society (see The Satanic Panic of the 1980s & 1990s). Countless people who simply didn’t fit the mold of their community have been falsely accused of and imprisoned for horrible crimes ranging from rape to murder.  What is The Satanic Temple?  The Satanic Temple is a religious and activist organization that was birthed from the idea that we are at a point in history where combating the status quo is an essential component of progression as individuals and as a society. In our view, Satan is a mascot for combating bigotry and detrimental authority. We see God and Satan as literary figures that have become so deeply engrained in our culture that much of our public policy and legislation is based upon their story.  In the infamous revolt of the angels, Satan (let’s refer to him as Lucifer the Angel, as he is called in the New Testament) was, of the angels created by God, said to be the most perfect, powerful, and intelligent. God essentially created these angels to be hit men — immediately sending them off on quests to murder people who challenged him. Lucifer identified this problem, rallied some of the other angels, and confronted God to challenge his authority. Most any Christian you talk to will see this as Lucifer being arrogant, but we see it as bravery. As a result of Lucifer’s revolt, he was cast out of heaven by God, where he then fell to Earth and bestowed the gift of knowledge to human kind (specifically to Eve in the Garden of Eden in Genesis). We see ourselves as aligning with a literary figure that is heavily misinterpreted, and undertaking the same mission. Since we don’t believe in the supernatural, the concept of a nontheistic but Satanic ritual seems like an oxymoron.  What is the Destruction Ritual?  I’ll preface by saying, it’s not for invoking Satan, but rather combating harmful power over us just as Lucifer the angel did in the Bible. The Destruction Ritual was born from a tradition I have done for many years with friends and loved ones on New Year’s Eve. We would gather around a fire with some scraps of paper, pens, and a few bottles of liquor. We would take turns writing things down on the pieces of paper, reading them aloud, throwing them into the fire and then taking a shot. It would start out with us drawing dicks or writing silly stuff, but as the night progressed and the bottles emptied, we found ourselves sobbing, hugging, and getting some really sticky shit off our chests.  Then one year, we started bringing physical objects to destroy. Things that bore some kind of sentimental value we hung onto, but in reality just sat in a box in a closet somewhere and caused us negative emotions when we remembered they were there. We felt by hanging onto these objects, we were holding onto the hope of a failed relationship or the improvement of someone’s character, or a good memory we would cling to like this object was a life raft, but all it did was hurt us. My friend had a box of these creepy ceramic dogs her abusive grandfather gave her every year for her birthday. Another friend had an engagement ring from his ex fiancée that cheated in him. I had an antique children’s tambourine my ex gave me that I couldn’t let go of for some reason, as well as a bunch of photos and letters. We took turns smashing our objects with hammers, knives, and throwing the pieces into the fire. Afterwards, I felt a sense of empowerment I had never felt before, and an epiphany. The relationship was done, but I had let it still continue to hurt me by giving power to this stupid little plastic tambourine and a box of paper. By hanging onto them, I allowed the toxicity to seep into my everyday and gave something inanimate delusional purpose. We all cried, hugged, and stood around the fire silently watching the shards of our bad memories burn in the fire.  The Destruction Ritual serves this very purpose — destroying objects that we have given the power to hurt us. It’s a form of self love, as you are trusting that by destroying these stupid things, you will be stronger and lighter, so to speak, after doing it. So much of our culture revolves around material possessions. Our social status is assigned by what we have, our self worth is measured by what we have. We go into debt to buy cars and clothes and technology that pollutes the environment and will probably break and need to be replaced within two years anyway. In a way, you could stretch it and say the Destruction Ritual is your own petty way of combating the detrimental effects of capitalism. Whatever floats your boat.  Destruction Ritual performed by The Satanic Temple in Los Angeles during the Satanic Mass of 2017.  We performed this ritual (which also involves an incantation) at our Satanic Mass in January of 2017. Wedding rings, old medication bottles, gifts from exes and a diary were among the things destroyed. As I was reciting it, I looked at the audience and saw a lot of crying faces. Our Arizona chapter also performed it over the summer and it yielded a similar effect. This thing sounds goofy, but trust me, it feels really, really good.  So gather some loved ones, or just grab a hammer and ride solo. Here is the how to for the Destruction Ritual.  How to perform the Destruction Ritual:  Step One — Gather your object(s):  Preference is given to something you’re holding onto that has a negative association to a person or memory or action. Maybe it’s something you hide so it’s not in sight everyday to cause you grief, but it’s there and you can’t let go of it. It could be a possession or gift from someone abusive or cruel, a piece of clothing from “the old you”, bank statements or receipts from a time you made a poor financial decision, a token of some kind of failure (relationship, friendship, or a personal failure). If something doesn’t immediately come to mind, you can improvise. Write angry things you want to get off your chest onto a piece of paper and put it in a glass bottle.  Step Two — Find a good place to do it:  Ideally somewhere outdoors, where it’s safe to get dirty and have sharp pieces of your freshly destroyed bad memories around. It’s best to place plastic or something underneath so cleanup is easy and damage to surrounding area is minimized. Objects can also be placed on a platter of some kind. Fireplace, bonfire or fire pit is a bonus.  Step Three — Choose your weapon:  Depending on the object(s) you are destroying, choose your weapon of destruction. Hammers, daggers, baseball bats, crowbars, mallets, and knives work well. It’s really up to you and the space available to you. Don’t forget safety — if you are destroying something shatterable like glass or ceramics, wear safety glasses and gloves.  Step Four — Set the mood:  Light some candles, pick some music (we recommend Author & Punisher as an official TST Destruction Ritual selection), and lay your object(s) and weapon(s) of choice out.  Step Five — Recite the incantation:  * The “Ave Satanas” are totally optional and up to you, the reciter. But they’re fun to yell.  These were things that I held in my hands  These were things that belonged to me  These were things that I held in my heart  These were things that have meaning to me  These things are not dead, because they never carried life  But I gave these things life, because they have carried me  I gave these things my memories  My fear  My secrets  My tears  My blood  My devotion  My hate  My forgiveness  My pain  My pleasure  My love  My disdain  I am the creator of life in these things  For without me, they would not be  And people would seek to profit off what I give  With no mutual heart given back to me  We emancipate ourselves from this material slavery  For without my heart, these things would not be  (Ave Satanas)  We liberate ourselves from this endless cycle  Of voids filled with unnecessary greed  I fill my voids with love and compassion  I fill my voids with clarity  I fill my void with the beauty that surrounds me  I fill my voids with only that which propels me  (Ave Satanas)  Together we raise our arms and unshackle ourselves from the control these things have over us  Together we raise our hammers and daggers, and with them pierce the heart of that control  A power driven by addiction, attachment, consumption, and by a relentless hunger for excess  (Ave Satanas)  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  Step Six — Destroy your object(s):  Self-explanatory. Discard the pieces afterwards, there’s no point in holding on. Have at it, and be well. Ave Satanas, Hail Satan.	1
This Is Us kicked off its second season last year with a bit of a stumble, courtesy of NBC: the network announced at its 2017 upfront that the show would move to Thursdays, only to backtrack two weeks later. But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.  After avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC—which won’t have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season—will be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.  Robert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is “the only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,” he said. “When 12 to 14 million people watch America’s Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that’s an extraordinary cultural achievement.”  While Greenblatt scuttled the show’s Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show’s narrative arc, he didn’t consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.  “We felt, by this point, that it’s a Tuesday staple, for I’m happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,” said Greenblatt. “So we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let’s keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let’s build more of a good thing on Thursday. We’re really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There’s a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.”  As for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, “we have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,” said Greenblatt. “I haven’t seen a creator who’s as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He’s weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven’t even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.”  Fogelman “knew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia’s character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,” said Greenblatt. “So there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.”  NBC thinks the show’s momentum will continue this season. “I feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don’t want to give anything away,” said Greenblatt. “But there’s some extraordinary things he’s going to do this year.”	0
So it seems that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have finally decided to go public with their romance which the two have managed to keep under wraps for years now. The ongoing denials by each star certainly had the masses scratching their heads seeing as the duo were often seen in one another’s company on getaways and at various locales in Los Angeles.  Reasons for Katie and Jamie not going public earlier are rumored to be due to a contract that was signed by Holmes during her swift divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Tom Cruise. The contract was said to have included a five-year dating clause which meant that the Dawson’s Creek star was not allowed to date publicly for this duration. Well, that was back in 2012, so the five years are up, which leads onlookers to believe that the contract was a real binding agreement.  Additional claims, since Jamie and Katie were spotted walking in Malibu holding hands, have been made regarding Cruise’s reaction to his ex and former co-star coming clean about their relationship. The action star is reportedly “furious” and “envious” about the relationship between Holmes and Foxx and feels a sense of betrayal over it all, as International Business Times states.  A said source indicates that Tom is bothered by the romance and that “Katie is so happy with someone else,” adding that “Tom would love to find his own true love, someone he can share the rest of his life with too. ”  ‘Katie Holmes finally goes public with new man Jamie Foxx, I’m questioning why she ever agreed to marry Tom Cruise’https://t.co/NWx1Ogo3ml — The Sun (@TheSun) September 10, 2017  It’s been no secret that Cruise’s relationship with the Church of Scientology has caused both of his marriages to fail and if the star is to find love again, it must be with the approval of the faith. As for Tom being “furious,” this seems a bit far-fetched seeing as the actor was snapped looking as happy as can be, even after news broke that Katie and Jamie are, in fact, an item.  Tom Cruise is pictured for the first time since ex-wife Katie Holmes confirmed her relationship with Jamie Foxx https://t.co/BqKD4cDrxm — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 6, 2017  As The Sun indicated, Cruise recently landed in London and fans awaiting the Hollywood heartthrob were greeted with an ear-to-ear smile from Tom, who also gave an enthusiastic thumbs up. The actor had recently been injured while filming the latest installment for the Mission Impossible franchise, yet looked much better and entirely unaffected by the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reveal.

A surprise guest was among the thousands in attendance at Lady Gaga‘s Chicago Wrigley Field concert on Friday.  Fans spotted the “Bad Romance” singer’s ex-fiancé, Taylor Kinney, among the throng of concertgoers. Several attendees posted about the celebrity sighting, with a few people sharing pics of the celebrity posing for snaps with people in the stadium.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Tay with fans at Lady Gaga’s concert in Chicago last night. #TaylorKinney #LadyGaga,” a twitter user wrote for his post.  While Gaga didn’t address her ex’s attendance at the concert, she did post a pic and caption on Twitter, writing about her historic appearance at the Chicago stadium. “So proud to have been the 1st Woman to headline at Wrigley Field #joanneworldtour wih my manager and friend by my side! We love u Chicago!” Gaga wrote.  The Chicago Fire star had famously proposed to Gaga on Valentine’s Day in 2015, but the couple ended their five-year relationship in July of 2016.  The couple had always seemed supportive of each other’s careers. In 2016, Kinney turned down the opportunity to take the stage with Gaga at the Golden Globes award ceremony to make sure all eyes were on her.  “Do you want to know something wonderful?” she told PEOPLE that year. “They asked him to present tonight, but he said no because he just wanted it to be my night and he wanted to support me. Isn’t that special? I just found that out. I love him so much.”  Tay with fans at Lady Gaga's concert in Chicago last night. #TaylorKinney #LadyGaga pic.twitter.com/N0cI30G2gw — ᵀᴱᴬᴹ ᴷᴵᴺᴺᴱᵞ ™ (@TaylorkUpdates) August 26, 2017  I met @taylorkinney111 last night and he's such a cool guy.

Meghan Markle, 36, will marry Prince Harry, 33, in a royal wedding ceremony on May 19 2018, and it seems the royal’s wife-to-be stands out from his previous girlfriends in one particular way.  It is known Prince Harry had high profile relationships with Chelsy Davy, 32, and Cressida Bonas, 29, before he began dating Meghan in 2016.  However, a royal expert has said no previous romantic interest had ever “tamed” Harry in the way that Meghan has done.  “I think Meghan has had a really positive influence on Harry,” Katie Nicholl, author of Harry Life Loss and Love told Express.co.uk exclusively.  “Historically Harry has always been ‘tamed’ by his girlfriends, we saw that with Chelsy and Cressida, but I think Meghan’s had a bigger influence on him than any other woman.”	1
Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It’s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. I’m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm, he says as he plows toward the ballroom.Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable womana former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson scripta bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. I was telling one of my buddies up there, You know, it’s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.’ And he says, Well, don’t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.’ Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. And then he says, Thompson, you got it all covered.’ Everyone laughs.Today, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. We can’t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We’ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can’t prove they’re terrorists within 24 hours, you’ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain’t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.Someone shouts Go, Fred, go.Now it’s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. People talk about the last election. They say, The war, the war, the war,’ Thompson says with a sigh. I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it’s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.A minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. Maybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues. The applause builds to a standing ovation. You know, I had another comment or two, Thompson says, but I think that’s the perfect place to stop.Thompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete, Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. Without raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I’ve already saved $50 million this year. Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.Since announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson’s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn’t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.	0
"Caitriona Balfe is best known for her role as Claire Fraser on Outlander, and while attending the 75th annual Golden Globes Sunday night (she was nominated for ""Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series–Drama"") the 38-year-old completely shocked everyone on the red carpet when a gorgeous engagement ring was spotted on her finger. See for yourself below.  Getty Images  Getty Images  So who's the lucky guy? Balfe told People she's engaged to her boyfriend of almost two years, Tony McGill. The couple have kept their relationship fairly very private. As in, so private that there's virtually zero evidence of McGill on the internet. Here's the little of what we know about Balfe's fiancé and their relationship over the past two years.  They got engaged over the holidays.  ""It happened over the break,"" Balfe revealed. ""I’m very happy.""    Like Balfe, he's Irish.  Did ""McGill"" give it away?  There's a throwback video of the pair from 2015, and he looks *so* in love with her.  They've only been spotted in public together twice.  First at the 2016 ceremony for Jodie Foster’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and almost a year ago at the 2017 Oscar Wilde Awards.  Balfe and McGill attend the 2017 Oscar Wilde Awards in Los Angeles. Getty Images  And although McGill seems like more of a mystery man than ever at this point, we can only hope the pair will be more open about their relationship now that Balfe has *officially* announced the engagement."	0

But sources say there’s another huge reason for her wanting to lie low – problems with Brad Pitt, who friends have confirmed would be the father of her child.  It’s believed Brad and Jen – who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen’s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year – have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad’s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.  Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.  Added to this is the fact Jen’s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it’s a difficult time for the actress.  ‘She’s under a lot of stress at the moment, so... all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,’ adds the source.  ‘Not only is she going through a messy divorce, she’s having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she’s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.  ‘Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they’re just friends and that he’s committed but Jen just isn’t buying it.  ‘She’s very wary of him – after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.  ‘While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she’s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that’s how everything worked out,’ reveals the insider.  After her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.  ‘She had been sad it never happened,’ a source told the magazine. ‘But it never consumed her.’  But since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.  ‘This could be a dream come true for her, and she’s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that’s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.’  Over the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.  In the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: ‘This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don’t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,’ she told Allure.  Denying that was the case, she said: ‘No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.’  For the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!	1

Who could forget Prince William's goddaughter, Grace Van Cutsem, stealing the limelight during his first kiss with the Duchess of Cambridge after their wedding?  The latest kid to totally upstage a monarch is 11-year-old Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway.  As the Norwegian royal family and nobility gathered on the balcony of an Oslo palace to celebrate the King Harald and Queen Sonja's 80th birthdays, well-wishers waved and cheered.  (Image: Getty)  But to the left of the monarchs in clips of the celebrations, a cheeky young prince was doing his best to keep fellow youngsters entertained - and totally stole the show.  Prince Sverre, who is third in line to the Norwegian throne - just like Britain's Prince George - could be seen mumbling and pulling faces, drawing eye rolls from his cousins and sister.  The cheeky chap, son of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, then decided to kick it up a notch and performed the popular 'dab' move (you can watch the video to see exactly how this one works) prompting giggles from the children around him.  It was such a 'blink and you'll miss it' moment, he almost got away with it, but unfortunately for him, cameras captured everything.  His antics prompted a sharp nudge from fed-up cousin Leah Isadora Behn, aged 12, who looks as though she was keeping him in check.  The clip prompted comparisons to Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011, when flower girl Grace Van Cutsem upstaged the couple's first kiss by covering her ears due to the noise of the crowd.

She and her reality TV family oversaw his hospital treatment and subsequent rehab.  After his recovery, their divorce was finalized in 2016.

Iowa’s golden girl, Shawn Johnson, revealed she recently suffered a miscarriage in a heartbreaking and emotional video posted Saturday on YouTube.    The 25-year-old former gymnast, who represented the United States at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and came home with a gold and three silver medals, decided to share the video because “we felt like a lot of people go through this.”    The nearly 21-minute video starts off with Johnson crying tears of joy and revealing that she is pregnant.    Her husband, former NFL player Andrew East, tells his future unborn child, “If you are on the way, I love you. I have no idea who you are, what you are, or what you’ll be like, but I’m pumped to meet you.”    Johnson gives her husband a pair of Converse baby sneakers and tells him that she is pregnant before they give each other a big hug.    But then came the news no expectant mother ever wants to hear.  Advertisement  After she experienced bleeding, Johnson went to the doctor’s office, where the doctor confirmed the “Dancing with the Stars” winner was miscarrying but that it’s not her fault.    “So, it’s been a roller coaster of a few days. We just got back from the doctor and I’m no longer pregnant. Somehow, I lost the pregnancy already. It sucks. It’s definitely no fun, guys … and having a doctor confirm that we miscarried doesn’t feel good,” Johnson said in the video. “I’ve cried enough today, I don’t need to cry anymore.”    Johnson uploaded the video Saturday morning, and it’s already been seen more than 100,000 times as of late Saturday afternoon.  In the caption, she wrote: “The past 48 hours have been some of the happiest, scariest, and saddest times of my life.  My husband Andrew and I found out that we were unexpectedly pregnant, only to find out hours later some tragic news. I have been crying more than I ever have, but am still optimistic for what is next.”  AlertMe	0
It appears Brad Pitt has officially moved on from Angelina Jolie, doing some “serious flirting” with Sienna Miller during a congratulatory dinner for their new film, The Lost City of Z.  According to Page Six, witnesses say the pair got cozy at a restaurant near the ArcLight movie theater in Los Angeles, the movie’s premiere location, where they spent some time with a group of friends.  PHOTOS: Brad Pitt Struggles To Smile At Hollywood Event While Custody Battle Wears Him Down  Pitt and Miller were “heavily enjoying each other’s company,” and “were talking to each other all night,” a source told the publication.  Another insider added that Pitt, who’s been caught looking frail in recent months, was “in very high spirits, which he hasn’t been for a long time. He seems to be over a hump.”  Miller previously denied dating rumors, saying: “So this is the truth about that: Brad Pitt is producing the movie that I just wrapped, but I didn’t see him. He’s not been to the set. You know, he’s the producer of the film and I’ve met him twice. It’s insane.”  PHOTOS: Wearing Thin!

Kristen Wiig.  Kristen Wiig might be sticking her claws into Wonder Woman. According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is being considered to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the upcoming highly anticipated movie sequel. Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.	1
She may be country music’s darling, but Taylor Swift‘s life wasn’t always so sweet.  “Junior high was actually sort of hard because I got dumped by this group of popular girls,” the singer-songwriter, 19, tells Teen Vogue for its March issue, on sale Feb. 3.  “They didn’t think I was cool or pretty enough, so they stopped talking to me.”  Another reason she was singled out? “The kids at school thought it was weird that I liked country [music],” she says. “They’d make fun of me.”  But all that changed in ninth grade when she moved from her hometown in Pennsylvania to Nashville and scored a record deal.  A year into her career, Swift returned to perform in the place where earlier she’d been mocked – and saw the girls who made her feel so badly about herself.  “They showed up, wearing my T-shirts and asking me to sign their CDs,” says Swift. “It was bittersweet, because it made me realize that they didn’t remember being mean to me and that I needed to forget about it, too.”  Besides, she says, “Really, if I hadn’t come home from school miserable every day, maybe I wouldn’t have been so motivated to write songs. I should probably thank them!”  RELATED ARTICLE:  • Inside Taylor’s pretty in pink 18th birthday party!  RELATED GAME:  • Play matchmaker to the stars of country music in Love Connection!

Kaley Cuoco is married!  The Big Bang Theory star tied the knot with professional equestrian Karl Cook at an intimate wedding at a horse stable near San Diego, California, attended by close friends and family on Saturday, PEOPLE confirms.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Legally KCSQUARED 6-30-18 ❤,” Cuoco captioned an Instagram showing her kissing Cook near horse stalls.  For the big day, the actress wore a white lace dress with a cape by Reem Acra and styled by Brad Goreski and Daniela Romero, while Cook went with a classic look in a tux. Cuoco later changed into a lace Tadashi Shoji jumpsuit with Louise et Cie shoes and threw her hair into a ponytail for the reception.  Jamie Greenberg  “Ok let’s party!!! #kcsquared 💋 💕,” Cuoco captioned a second snap of the newlyweds gearing up for the reception.  RELATED: How Kaley Cuoco Achieved Her ‘Effortless and Natural’ Wedding Day Look — All the Details!  Cuoco, 32, and Cook, 27, delivered their own wedding vows, which had the bride both laughing and wiping tears from her cheeks, as a guest showed in an Instagram video.  One guest shared the moment Cook and Cuoco were married by her sister Briana Cuoco.  “I love you both so much,” Briana said before joking about how she took an online course to officiate the wedding, making Cuoco kneel over laughing.  Once pronounced husband and wife, the crowd cheered as the couple leaned in for their first kiss as newlyweds.  Another special video features the pair preparing for their first dance at the reception.  Cuoco and Cook got engaged on her birthday in November 2017 after dating for nearly two years.  Just hours before sharing the proposal on social media, Cook teased Cuoco with a fake ring while shopping at Target.  “On my loves birthday I got her everything she has always wanted….now judging by her face maybe not, it’s the thought that counts right,” he shared.  Then, Cook — the son of software billionaire Scott Cook — treated her to a romantic candlelit dinner and popped the question for real for a stunning tear-drop diamond, documenting her tearful reaction on Instagram.  She celebrated her bachelorette party in June.  “He is my perfect match,” Cuoco gushed to PEOPLE in March, adding that she hoped to make their pets part of their wedding. “He lets me wake up in the morning and say, ‘I want to go and rescue rabbits.’ And he’s like, ‘All right, let’s get a coffee and let’s go.’ And that is him. We are the same, our views are the same, our morals are the same, he is my perfect match.”  Karl Cook and Kaley Cuoco Milla Cochran/startraks  The duo started dating in spring 2016 and made their first public appearance as a couple in September that same year. (This is the actress’s second marriage; she filed for divorce from former tennis player Ryan Sweeting in September 2015.)  “From the beginning, Kaley was crazy about Karl,” an insider previously told PEOPLE. “They have so much in common and he makes her so happy. She went through such a tough time with her divorce from Ryan, but she never gave up on finding love again. She’s really a romantic!”	0
"Gigi Hadid hit social media on Monday to defend her arguably perfect body against some online haters, putting her life in stark relief against the lives of others whose problems include actual problems. Wait — strike that:  Gigi Hadid hit social media Monday to teach body-shamers a lesson they obviously deserve because the world should always be kind, gentle and supportive. And criticism-free.  Whew, that feels so much better.  The 20-year-old fashion model, who clocks in at 5-foot-10 and has already taken a daring stand about wanting to weigh more than ""2 pounds soaking wet,"" explained that despite being essentially superhuman, she's also just human.  ""Yes, judgment on social media comes from people who, 99% of the time, have no idea what they're talking about, but I'm human, and I'm not going to lie, I did let the negativity get to me a little,"" she wrote. ""I came to a realization that when one gets to this point, it's important to rethink why you're doing what you do. What your message is. What you have to say.""  See the most-read Entertainment stories this hour >>  And what does the daughter of a ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star have to say in the context of an industry that depends on hanger-like models fitting into size 0 clothes on the catwalk?  ""Yes, I have boobs, I have abs, I have a butt, I have thighs, but I'm not asking for special treatment. I'm fitting into the sample sizes.""  Also, she doesn't think she's the best model in every show but does think she needs to improve her runway walk.  A photo posted by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Sep 28, 2015 at 4:25am PDT  That said, any and all critics should get over themselves. ""If you don't like it, don't follow me, don't watch me, cause I'm not going anywhere,"" she said. ""If I didn't have the body I do, I wouldn't have the career I do. I love that I can be sexy. I'm proud of it.""  Hadid, who's BFFs with people like Taylor Swift, dates people like Joe Jonas and along with Kendall Jenner is kind of the model of the moment, has previously defended her looks.  ""I just want to be a healthy role model and I haven't swayed from that at all,"" she told the Daily Mail Australia in an August interview that also saw her describing the ""huge thighs"" she had as a Junior Olympian and explaining that she eats burgers regularly but then uses the Master Cleanse lemon-cayenne-and-maple-syrup liquid diet to snap back into shape for runway shows.  Tyra Banks, modeling's house mother, was supportive of Hadid's message on Monday.  ""I haven't met you yet @gighadid but I FEEL you so much,"" the ""America's Next Top Model"" star wrote when she regrammed the post. ""Your words are powerful. Your words are necessary. Your words are vulnerable. Your words are real. Sending you love and hugs. From one model that had curves and a unique walk to another, Tyra.""  Kris Jenner also had Gigi's back on Instagram, reposting the missive and adding, ""This is from one of the sweetest, smartest, and most beautiful girl inside and out, in the world. Why do people with no life, no purpose, who are angry and bitter and ignorant, or just plain nasty and mean, choose to bring everyone else down instead of finding the best in others? I will never understand the BULLYS that lurk on Instagram just to try and ruin someone else's spirit. If all of their horrible negative energy was focused on being positive and seeing good, imagine what a better more peaceful place this world would be.""  ""Spread love and joy everyone, not hate,"" Jenner continued, shaming snarky people everywhere. ""It only reflects what kind of person you are.""

Share this article:  Caitlyn Jenner made a plea for respect for the transgender community as she accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPY Awards.  “This transition has been harder on me than anything I could imagine,” Jenner told the audience at the Microsoft Theater Wednesday night. “That’s the case for so many others besides me. For that reason alone trans people deserve something vital. They deserve your respect.”  Jenner, formerly known as 1976 Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, received the award to recognize “the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years,” according to ESPN.  Bruce Jenner, who said he has long suffered from gender confusion and told ABC earlier this year that he identifies as a woman, was re-introduced to the world as Caitlyn Jenner on June 1 with a flashy photo spread and feature story in Vanity Fair magazine.  Later that day, ESPN announced plans to give Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, which is presented “to individuals whose contributions transcend sports.”  “Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but the ESPYs are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,” ESPYs executive producer Maura Mandt said.  “She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.”  Previous recipients of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award include Muhammad Ali, Jim Valvano, Pat Tillman, Robin Roberts and Nelson Mandela. Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, received the honor last year.  The selection of Jenner to receive the award has generated some criticism — notably from sportscaster Bob Costas, who dubbed the choice “crass exploitation.”  Some critics suggested that the honor should have gone to Lauren Hill, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor but continued to pursue her dream of playing college basketball.  The Indiana native made the team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and played in four games — while helping to raise more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research.  Hill died on April 10 at age 19.  Hours before the ESPYs ceremony, organizers announced in a statement to USA Today that Hill will be honored during the show — noting that the recognition had always been planned, but was not previously announced.  The ESPY Awards honor celebrities from sports and entertainment to recognize major sports achievements and salute “leading performers and performances.”  Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry received the best male athlete award, beating a field that also included Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt.  MMA fighter Ronda Rousey received the best female athlete award over University of Connecticut basketball guard/forward Breanna Stewart, skiing star Lindsey Vonn and tennis champion Serena Williams.  The ESPYs ceremony were hosted by comedian/actor Joel McHale and televised on ABC.  Here is the list of winners: Best Male Athlete  — Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors Best Female Athlete  — Ronda Rousey, MMA Best Team  — U.S. women’s national soccer team Best Championship Performance  — LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers Best Breakthrough Athlete  — Mo’ne Davis, Little League Baseball Best Record-Breaking Performance  — Peyton Manning throws record-509th touchdown pass Best Upset  — Mississippi over Alabama, college football Best Game  — Super Bowl Best Play  — Odell Beckham Jr. Best Coach/Manager  — Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors Best Comeback Athlete  — Rob Gronkowski, New England Patriots Best International Athlete  — Lionel Messi, Barcelona/Argentina Best NFL Player  — Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers Best MLB Player  — Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Best NHL Player  — Jonathan Toews, Chicago Blackhawks Best Driver  — Kevin Harvick, NASCAR Best NBA Player  — Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors Best WNBA Player  — Skylar Diggins, Tulsa Shock Best Fighter  — Ronda Rousey, MMA Best Male Golfer  — Jordan Spieth Best Female Golfer  — Lydia Ko Best Male Tennis Player  — Novak Djokovic Best Female Tennis Player  — Serena Williams Best Male College Athlete  — Marcus Mariota, Oregon football Best Female College Athlete  — Missy Franklin, Cal swimming Best Male Action Sports Athlete  — Ryan Dungey, motocross Best Female Action Sports Athlete  — Kelly Clark, snowboarding Best Jockey  — Victor Espinoza Best Male Athlete with a Disability  — Krige Schabort, Triathlon Best Female Athlete with a Disability  — Becca Meyers, swimming Best Bowler  — Jason Belmonte Best MLS Player  — Robbie Keane, Los Angeles Galaxy Special Awards Jimmy V Award for Perseverance  — Devon and Leah Still Pat Tillman Award for Service  — Danielle Green Best Moment  — Lauren Hill Icon Award  — Derek Jeter Arthur Ashe Award for Courage  — Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner: Becoming woman harder than anything was last modified: by  >> Want to read more stories like this?

Star magazine has released an explosive report today that claims a woman has come forward to claim she is pregnant with Brad Pitt's child.  The 54-year-old actor has allegedly learnt that a former 'twenty-something' fling from earlier this year, who wishes to remain anonymous, has come forward to the publication.  'This will be an absolute nightmare for Bard if her claims are true,' an insider spilled. 'After all the drama he's been through over the past two years, he's desperate to keep his life as trouble and scandal free as possible.'  According to Star's bombshell claims, the mystery woman is willing to undergo a paternity test and use the results to effectively tell Brad, 'I've got the DNA tests to prove it!'	1
"KIM Kardashian has broken her silence over claims she’s chosen the woman who will be a surrogate for her third child with Kanye West.  Yesterday it was reported the famous couple were in contact with “a married African-American college graduate with two children” who would help bring their third child into the world.  Splash News 15 Kim Kardashian has broken her silence over reports she has chosen the woman she wants as her surrogate  But it seems Kim isn’t ready to discuss details yet, as she told E! News she would talk about her much-talked-about “third child” when she was ready.  Kim explained: “[There’s] so many details out there, and like I've never heard this, I've never heard this.  “Like whatever. We have not confirmed it, and that's that. I'll let you know when we're ready.  “I've definitely seen a lot of things, we've never confirmed anything.”  Kim made the comments during a night out with her sister Kendall Jenner at the Harper's BAZAAR event celebrating ICONS By Carine Roitfeld in New York.  Rumours surrounding Kim and Kanye deciding to expand their family have been circulating for months, after the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she would use a surrogate.  Splash News 15 The reality star and her husband Kanye West have been at the centre of numerous surrogacy reports over the past few weeks  Earlier this week it was revealed that the couple, who are already parents to North, four, and Saint, one, will be welcoming a baby girl in January.  According to TMZ, the pair decided to have a third baby via surrogacy because of Kim's well-documented medical issues during her previous pregnancies.  Getty - Contributor 15 According to recent claims, the pair are expecting their third baby in January 2018  BackGrid 15 Kim was last seen in public out and about in LA on August 24  X17Online.com 15 Kanye was seen leaving a recording studio in LA on Tuesday night  Another source told People: ""The entire family is over the moon.  ""Given her health scares in the past, Kim felt the need to hire a surrogacy agency that helped serve as the liaison in finding a healthy woman who would be a great surrogate option for her and Kanye.  ""Both of them have been super involved in the process.""  Neither Kim nor Kanye has confirmed the news but it's not the first time they've been at the centre of speculation a third child is on the way.  Reports of a surrogate surfaced in July, with Us Weekly claiming their chosen surrogate was already three months pregnant.  An insider alleged at the time that the woman was approached by the famous couple through “an agency”.  Getty - Contributor 15 Kim and Kanye are already parents to daughter North, four, and son Saint, one, both conceived naturally  Claims of a surrogate child being on the way come after Kim revealed she suffers from a condition that means she is unable to carry any more children.  In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians aired last year, the reality star was warned she could ""bleed to death"" if she falls pregnant for a third time.  Kim sought her doctor's advice after admitting she wanted a third pregnant but fearing the same complications she endured in past pregnancies would return.  Getty - Contributor 15 Kim, pictured in 2015 while pregnant with Saint, has been warned she could 'bleed to death' if she falls pregnant again  Doctor Crane warned her against it and said there is a ""potential fear"" for her after she suffered from toxaemia - toxins in the blood from infection - and had two ""very traumatic"" labours with North and Saint.  He said: ""Here's what I think, your pregnancies, you had toxaemia, you had a retained placenta, very traumatic, we're always worried about the next serious complication. I think the potential fear of the whole situation is legitimate.  ""You never know that you might not have the same type of problem that might be more serious this time. You're always taking a little bit of a chance. There are situations where retained placenta could be life and death.""  Her mother Kris, 61, then said: ""You could bleed to death"".  What is toxaemia of pregnancy? During Kim’s last two pregnancy she suffered from toxaemia – more commonly known as pre-eclampsia. It is a condition that can affect pregnant women, resulting in high blood pressure and damage to one or more organs, often the kidneys. It is usually diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy and can lead to serious complications for mother and baby. In Kim’s case she was warned that she could ‘bleed to death’ if she got pregnant again following complications the last two times.  Splash News 15 Kim suffered toxaemia during her pregnancies with North and Saint  Instagram 15 Kim confirmed in August that she and Kanye wanted a third child  Kim confirmed last month that she and Kanye were hopeful of a third child, but kept tight lipped about details or timing.  Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility of a third child, she said: ""I hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We're definitely trying. We are hoping so.""  Getty - Contributor 15 Kim, seen while pregnant with Saint, hinted in August that she and Kanye were trying for a third child  Fame Flynet 15 The star has openly spoken about exploring surrogacy  Kim has spoken in the past about exploring surrogacy - and even said she'd asked sisters Kourtney and Khloe if they would be willing to carry her child.  Speaking during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, she explained: ""I have had to go through multiple things to try and do it on my own but I do not think that is looking good for me but I am not giving up.  ""So it is a process. You kind of see the whole thing on this next season of our show... of me begging Khloe to help out, but I do not want to do that to her.  ""My mom offered, Kourtney offered.""  BackGrid 15 Kim has asked her sisters if they would be surrogates for her and Kanye  EPA 15 The couple have been married since 2015  Kim’s troubles began when she was pregnant with her first child North after doctors discovered she had a high-risk condition called placenta accreta.  The rare condition occurs when the placenta attaches too deep into the uterine wall and is life-threatening because the sufferer can lose an average of three to five litres of blood during delivery.

"Serena Williams has the cutest baby girl, and she knows it too. Maybe that’s why they’re always twinning in adorable matching outfits. In addition to being the G.O.A.T. in tennis, Williams is a happily married mom. We get to see that on her social media, and it’s so sweet.  She’s also a successful business mogul. (Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies.  Basically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn’t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she’s sharing her joy, and that’s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she’s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it’s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend. Williams shared their ensembles via her Instagram Story on Saturday, even detailing their accessories. (Because c’mon, no look is complete without the right accessories.)  Just look at this gorgeous mother-daughter duo!  Serena Williams / Instagram  Here’s how Serena Williams described their coordinating looks:  ""Olympia is wearing a beautiful tulle dress with gold, and it's white, and that's why I decided to wear white,"" Williams said. ""Now check out her gold shoes! Olympia decided that she wanted to wear gold shoes, so mommy decided to wear gold shoes to match her, and we decided we'd try to be twinsies.""  We think you nailed it and then some, Serena.  Truthfully, the two look adorably happy together in every pic, even when they’re not matching.  Happy Easter, Serena and Alexis Olympia!"	0

""My new album is like another member of the team, or the family. It will be a true warrior, has something from all genres, from banda to pop, collaborations with DJ Snake and Selena Gomez.

The news of their unexpected collab comes just months after Gomez returned to the spotlight following her musical hiatus at the 2016 American Music Awards, where she gave a heartfelt and inspirational speech.  This will be the first time Gomez and the former X-Factor judge, who recently performed with Demi Lovato during a concert in Mexico City, have teamed up for a single."	1
Angelina Jolie wants to get “revenge” on Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, according to a completely wrong report. The story alleges Jolie is facing her “worst fear” now that Pitt and Aniston have supposedly reunited, and claims she’s striking back. But Gossip Cop can debunk the contentions.  According to Woman’s Day, Jolie has been a “constant fixture on the red carpet” recently and is “pulling out all the stops to look simply stunning at every occasion,” but her “flawless show-off is purely for Brad and Jennifer’s benefit.” The narrative suggests Jolie wants her estranged husband and his ex-wife to see how well she’s doing, even though she’s privately upset. “Ange is one green-eyed woman right now and can’t stand the thought of Brad spending time with Jen,” a so-called “source” is quoted as saying.  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  “She’s seething even thinking about it,” the tabloid’s supposed snitch continues, alleging Jolie was “always petrified” Aniston would “rear her head again.” In fact, the purported tipster claims Jolie would “squirm and spit venom” if she ever saw a “glimpse” of Aniston’s name during her marriage to Pitt. The gossip magazine even contends “Jennifer’s name was banned from the Jolie-Pitt household,” and asserts that with a “romantic reunion [in] the cards between Brad and Jennifer,” Jolie’s “biggest fears could be realized.”  The outlet’s aforementioned “source” alleges, “The very thought of Jen playing ‘stepmom’ to [her] kids… makes her toes curl. She says it’s her worst nightmare, which she can’t and won’t let happen.” And so the publication claims Jolie plans on getting her “revenge” by proving Pitt “got back with Jennifer before they had officially broken up in 2016.” Explains the questionable insider, “Ange is convinced that proving they were talking before the split and uncovering their romance will give her more ammunition” in her divorce battle with the actor.  “She hopes it will help her get full custody of the kids by exposing Brad’s ‘irresponsible’ behavior,” contends the “source,” prompting the tabloid to editorialize, “Sounds like the war is about to get even messier.” But while Jolie and Pitt do still need to work out their divorce settlement, there is no “war” involving Aniston. In fact, Pitt and Aniston haven’t even seen each other in ages.  The suggestion that they were carrying on an affair in 2016 behind Jolie’s back, while Aniston was committed to her own husband Justin Theroux, is out-and-out fiction. Indeed, this entire story relies on false premises. Pitt and Aniston were not secretly engaged in a “romance” during their respective marriages, and there’s no “romantic reunion” on the horizon now. Therefore, Jolie has no reason to get “revenge” on the pair or drag Aniston into her divorce proceedings.  Furthermore, the notion that Jolie is only attending red carpet events to get Pitt and Aniston’s attention is ridiculous and false. In most cases, she has been at awards shows, such as the BAFTAs earlier this month, because her film First They Killed My Father was nominated. Other times, Jolie’s received special honors, like at the recent American Society Of Cinematographers Awards, and in other instances, she’s been invited to participate as a presenter. This all has nothing to do with Pitt and Aniston.  Related slideshow: Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt having secret sleepovers and more tabloid tales debunked	1
Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.	1
She just gave birth 3 months ago.  Is Khloe Kardashian pregnant again? We all know that she has always wanted to be a mother. She’s talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.  Around the time of True’s birth, Khloe’s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?  A post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  It’s safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she’s been trying again with Tristan?  A source has said, “Khloe loved being pregnant, but she’s the first to say how great she feels now that she’s lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.”  Even so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, “they’ve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It’s basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.”  The source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. “He’s been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn’t changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she’s not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan‘s a convincing guy,” the source revealed.  Is that enough to convince Khloe to try to get pregnant again? After giving birth, women have to wait six weeks before they can have sex again and the couple is well past that date.  But don’t get too excite because Khloe herself revealed that she’s not quite ready. A fan recently asked if she was having another baby:  Not right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol https://t.co/TthrxOQdHr — Khloé (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018  Keep in mind that she just went back to work, and is in the process of fixing her relationship with Tristan.

"Vincent Anthony Vaughn (born March 28, 1970)[1] is an American actor, producer, screenwriter, and comedian.  Vaughn began acting in the late 1980s, appearing in minor television roles before attaining wider recognition with the 1996 comedy-drama film Swingers. He has appeared in a number of films in the 1990s, including the sports film Rudy (1993), the sci-fi adventure dinosaur film The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), and the drama-thriller Return to Paradise (1998).  Other than his dramatic role in The Cell (2000), in the 2000s he acted in several comedies, including Old School (2003), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), The Break-Up (2006), Fred Claus (2007), and Four Christmases (2008). He continued his comedic roles in the 2010s with The Dilemma (2011), The Watch (2012), and The Internship (2013). In 2015, he starred as Frank Semyon in the second season of the HBO anthology crime drama television series True Detective alongside Colin Farrell, Taylor Kitsch and Rachel McAdams.  Early life [ edit ]  Vaughn was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His mother, Sharon Eileen (née DePalmo; born in Brantford, Ontario, Canada),[2] is a real estate agent and stockbroker who was once ranked as one of the United States' top money managers by Bloomberg Wealth Manager magazine. His father, Vernon Lindsay Vaughn, worked as a salesman for a toy company.[3] As a child, he was raised ""both Protestant and Catholic"" by his Catholic mother and Protestant father.[4][5]  Vaughn grew up in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, where he played football and baseball and wrestled, although he has called himself ""unathletic"" and ""very average"" at high school sports.[6] He then moved to Lake Forest, where he graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1988. He was introduced to musical theater at a young age and decided to become an actor in 1987. He has credited his mother as the inspiration behind his career, saying that ""I saw her overcome stuff, and I thought if you worked hard at something you'd give yourself a chance"".[7]  Career [ edit ]  Vaughn in 2006  In 1988, Vaughn was cast in a Chevrolet television commercial and subsequently moved to Hollywood. He appeared in the 1989 season of the television series China Beach and in three CBS Schoolbreak Specials in 1990. His first film role was 1993's Rudy playing Jamie O'Hare, where he also struck up a friendship with featured Jon Favreau. Two years later, he was cast in a lead role in a proposed revival of 77 Sunset Strip that was to air on the fledgling WB Television Network, but the project ceased development after initial testing. Vaughn did not receive wider success until his role in 1996's Swingers with Jon Favreau. Swingers was released in July 1996 and became a successful independent film. Vince's father Vernon also did a cameo in this film.  Afterwards, director Steven Spielberg cast Vaughn in the blockbuster The Lost World: Jurassic Park which gave him increased exposure. In 1998, he starred in the critically acclaimed drama Return to Paradise with Anne Heche, and starred in Clay Pigeons with Janeane Garofalo and Joaquin Phoenix. In 2000, he starred in The Cell with Jennifer Lopez and in 2001, appeared in Made, another film penned by Favreau. Vaughn also appeared in Dwight Yoakam's directorial debut movie South of Heaven, West of Hell. Vaughn's role in the successful 2003 comedy Old School skyrocketed his popularity.  In 2004, Vaughn appeared alongside Ben Stiller in the hit films Starsky & Hutch and Dodgeball. After this series of roles, Vaughn was dubbed one of the Hollywood ""Frat Pack"", a group of actors who frequently co-star in film comedies. He subsequently appeared in 2005's Thumbsucker, Be Cool, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Also in 2005, Vaughn starred alongside Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers, which grossed over $200 million at the United States box office. In 2006, Vaughn starred with Jennifer Aniston in the comedy-drama The Break-Up.  In 2007, Vaughn starred in the Christmas comedy Fred Claus, as a sarcastic, wild-at-heart older brother of Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti). The film was directed by David Dobkin, who previously directed Vaughn in Wedding Crashers, and co-starred Elizabeth Banks and Kevin Spacey. Next, he momentarily moved from comedy to drama in Sean Penn's critically acclaimed film Into the Wild, a film about the adventures of Christopher McCandless, which was also a best-selling book by Jon Krakauer.  In 2009, Vaughn starred in Couples Retreat, a comedy chronicling four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort. Malin Åkerman played his wife.[8] Vince's real-life father Vernon portrayed his father in the film. In February 2010, Vaughn was among the nearly 80 musicians and actors to sing on the charity-single remake of We Are the World.  Vaughn starred in Ron Howard's comedy, The Dilemma, released in January 2011. It was produced by Wild West Picture Show Productions, his production company.[9][10] On July 31, 2012, it was announced that Vaughn would be developing a reboot produced by CBS to the sitcom The Brady Bunch, which was taken off the air in 1974.[11] On December 5, 2012, it was announced that Vaughn is working on a project with Peter Billingsley and Glenn Beck called Pursuit of the Truth for TheBlaze.[12]  In 2013, Vaughn co-wrote and starred alongside Wedding Crashers co-star Owen Wilson in The Internship. In 2015, he starred in Unfinished Business, which grossed $4.8 million in its opening weekend, a career-low for Vaughn. He also starred in the second season of True Detective alongside Colin Farrell, which premiered on June 21. In 2016, he starred in the crime thriller Term Life, which featured friend and frequent collaborator Jon Favreau in a supporting role and was directed by another frequent collaborator, Peter Billingsley.[13]  Personal life [ edit ]  In 2005, Vaughn began dating Jennifer Aniston, his co-star in The Break-Up.[14] In late 2006, Vaughn filed a lawsuit against three tabloid magazines accusing them of falsely claiming that he had been unfaithful to Aniston.[15] They broke up in November 2006.[14]  In March 2009, it was reported that Vaughn was engaged to Canadian realtor Kyla Weber.[16] They married on January 2, 2010,[17] in the historic Armour House at Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Illinois. The couple have two children: daughter Locklyn Kyla Vaughn (born 2010) and son Vernon Lindsay Vaughn (born 2013).[18][19]  Vaughn supported Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul in both the 2008 and 2012 elections,[20] and Rand Paul in the 2016 election.[21] He has also appeared at a number of Libertarian Party events.[22]  In 2016, Vaughn began training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the Gracie Academy in Torrance, Los Angeles [23] and received his blue belt in February 2018.[24]  On June 10, 2018 Vaughn was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving and resisting arrest in Manhattan Beach, California after failing a sobriety test at a police checkpoint.[25]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Music videos [ edit ]  Video games [ edit ]  Year Title Role Notes 1997 Chaos Island: The Lost World Nick Van Owen Voice  Awards and Nominations [ edit ]"	1

"Every girl loves flowers, right? Well, Scott Disick may be testing that theory.  Splash News  Earlier this week, Bella Thorne took to Snapchat to show off a large bouquet of flowers that she received. A few hours later, Kourtney Kardashian took to Snapchat to show off a huge bouquet of flowers that she received.  Both sets of flowers looking quite similar in size, type and color.  According to multiple reports, the flowers were sent to both women by Scott -- perhaps as a bit of mea culpa for his recent behavior.  TMZ (who has images of the flowers) reported on June 15 that Bella's flowers were indeed sent from Scott. Bella shared the image in which her hair matched the color of the roses. ""Now I match z flowers,"" she said.  Scott, if you'll recall, took Bella to the Cannes Film Festival and proceeded to flirt with a parade of women. The actress went home early and reports said she felt ""used"" by Scott.  Splash News  On May 25 she tweeted, ""Yo this #cannes fancy life isn't for me"" to her 6.6 million followers. She later said, ""I'm not talking to scott or anyone else"" before including a hashtag with an expletive.  When another fan inquired what she was doing with the ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star Bella responded, ""Legit nothing trolololo""  Kourtney, meanwhile, is said to be less than thrilled with the father of her three children and reportedly won't allow him to see their children unless he sobers up.  ""[Scott] is off the rails again... abusing alcohol and other substances,"" TMZ reported on May 28, citing sources close to Scott and Kourtney.  WCP/4CRNS/VM/FAMEFLYNET PICTURES  TMZ also wrote that even Scott's friends are frustrated with his troubling behavior. ""A few weeks ago they got Kourtney to call Scott and plead with him to get help, but he wasn't having it,"" TMZ reported.  Many friends have wondered if Scott's behavior can be linked to Kourtney's new romance with model Younes Bendjima.  ""Scott is jealous of Kourtney's relationship,"" a Kardashian source told Us Weekly in May, adding that ""he's realizing that getting back with Kourtney isn't going to happen."""	0

The first thing you’ll notice about the Dark Knight in Batman v. Superman, the second installation of the newly re-launched DC Universe, is that he’s gotten bigger in stature, muscle, and armor. The next? He’s also badder — gruff, aggressive, and the kind of character willing to square up to the Man of Steel. Given this, you might miss the third fact, that Batman — or at least Ben Affleck, the actor playing him — is also, well, middle-aged.  “I knew that a big part of the audience’s expectation around the role would be how I looked physically,” Affleck, now 43, tells Men’s Journal over email. “And that was something I had some control over. If I was going to fail in this role, I wasn’t going to let it be in a way that could have prevented if I had worked harder.” Director Zack Snyder believes that he got the job done, recently voicing his approval of Affleck’s portrayal as the iconic character, in both of his personas: “He’s an amazing Bruce Wayne, let’s just be frank about that. And then when he puts the cowl on, you know he’s got the chin for it.”  Affleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer Walter Norton Jr., of the Institute of Performance and Fitness, who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010’s The Town. Based in Boston, Norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever Affleck is, whether it’s in Los Angeles or on location. “Getting ready for this role meant working hard, day in and day out with Walter,” says Affleck. “But it was the kind of work where I felt gains in not only my size, but also my mental and physical health.”  There are benefits of having history with a trainer. “Seven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker,” says Norton. “Like any relationship, it’s all about communication and honesty. I can tell him a little something that he doesn’t want to hear and that’s fine. We’re not tiptoeing around issues. So we just addressed it right at the top. We did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints.”  But that does not mean that Affleck had it easy. Every week Norton created a new regime for him with specific goals, targeting each muscle group relentlessly, and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers. In context, Affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for The Town, and for Batman V. Superman, he went all the way to 231 at 7.7 percent body fat, which they ended up “dialing back” to 225. “This time around we did more bodybuilding. We wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass. The volume was higher. We lived on a lot of the basics, 80-pound dumbbell curls, heavy-loaded carries, and farmers walks with 60-pound weights.”  Affleck needed that extra strength on set: The batsuit weighs some 75 pounds. There are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut, showing off his ripped physique, like one he shot in the Batcave doing pull-ups, while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight. “If I had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to, it was pull-ups and chin-ups.”  “We wanted him to look like a thick MMA heavyweight puncher,” explains Norton. “This is a Bruce Wayne who’s been lifting for 20 years, hitting that heavyweight bag, and working out every day in the manor. I’ll just say that if you lined up all the Batmans before Ben and stood them next to each other, they’re not 6’4”, and they don’t weigh 225 pounds. He’s in a whole other class.”  Here’s a two-day glimpse at the workouts Norton created for Affleck as part of their two-year training program. You might not want to try this one on your own, though. “I recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with, create their own program suiting their own goals, and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that Ben did, they can also make gains like a hero.”  Day 1:  Block 1 (32 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Elliptical (Strength Program): 15 minutes  Rumble Roller (Hip/TFL/VMO/2 Way Glute/Calf): 9 minutes  Plank with Arm Extension: 10 seconds (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Spiderman: From a plank, bring you right foot next to your right hand. 3 reps for each side (hold for 2 breaths)  Inchworm: From touching your toes with straight legs, walk your hands out to a plank, then walk your feet back under you, 5 reps (hold for 1 breath)  Calf Stretch: 15 seconds (each leg)  Block 2 (40 minutes): Torso & Strength  Dumbbell Farmer’s Walk: 4 walks with appropriate weight for 1 minute  Alternating Hanging Knee-Up: 11 reps (for each leg)  ½ Kneeling Row: Kneel on your right knee in front of a cable machine, row with your right arm, 4 sets of 12 reps on each side  Back Bridge: 2 reps of 15 second hold (5-second pause between)  Alternating Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 8 reps (for each leg)  Pull-Up: 6 sets of 4 reps (hold for 4 seconds up and 4 seconds down)  Shoulder Bridge: 10-second hold (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Block 3 (22 minutes / Doing As Many Sets As Possible): Strength & Fitness  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 20 seconds  V-Grip Pulldown: 15 reps  Seated Row Handle Grip: 12 reps  Alternating Dumbbell Open Curl: 5 sets of 5 reps (each arm, then 5 reps together)  Goblet Squat: 8 reps  Lateral Squat: 6 reps (each side)  Day 2:  Block 1 (30 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 10 reps of 5 minutes at 75% (finish with 15-second sprint, then 45-second rest)    Soft Roller (Upper Back/Lat/Quad/Glute/Ham Junction): 8 minutes  Brettzel Stretch : 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Kneeling Lat: 1 rep each side (hold for 5 breaths)  ½ Kneeling Quad Stretch: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Brettzel: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Block 2 (32 minutes): Torso & Strength  Off-Bench Oblique Side Crunch: 8 reps dynamic (followed with hold for 8 seconds)  Valslide Body Slide: 4 sets of 12 reps  Dumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 sets of 12 reps  Back Bridge with March: Hold bridge for 8 seconds (then 4 knee raises on each leg)  Dumbbell Shrug: 5 sets of 6 reps  Rear Delt Machine: 4 sets of 15 reps  1 Leg Hip Lift : 3 sets of 8 reps for each side (hold for 2 seconds)  Tricep Pushdown: 4 sets of 10 heavy reps, then 10 lighter reps  Block 3 (36 minutes): Strength  Dumbbell Deadlift: 4 sets of 6 reps  Dumbbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 10 reps (count 3 seconds from up to down position)  Pec Fly: 4 sets of 12 reps  Ball Leg Curl: 4 sets of 6 reps (hold for 2 seconds)  Batman v Superman is in theaters March 25, 2016.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro%3Frel%3D0%26controls%3D0%26showinfo%3D0	1

"Kim Kardashian is back to doing what she does best: posting photos of herself on Instagram in relatively little-to-no clothing, and giving no effs about it. Because why should she? Every body is a bikini body, and Kim looks incredible in hers, dammit!  I’m really shy... A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jul 20, 2018 at 11:28am PDT  But while Kim in a bikini isn't exactly breaking news, her caption (read: ""I'm really shy..."") essentially amounts to her trolling herself.

'Avengers: Infinity War' Cast Reads Mean Tweets on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!': Watch  “Tom Hiddleston is so f*cking ugly why is no one acknowledging this,” the actor in question read out with a deadpan stare into the camera. In the latest edition of “Mean Tweets” on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last night (April 30,) It was time for the cast of Avengers: Infinity War to see that just because their film had the biggest box office opening of all time, didn't mean they were immune to the haters.  “Scarlett Johansson has the emotional range of a f*cking celery. I hate white people,” Johansson read with pure shock on her face.  As the segment continued, the tweets only got harsher. “Don Cheadle look like a mix between a beetle, a muskrat and a roach,” Cheadle read, “that’s just f----- up,” he added. Fittingly, Captain America got the final blow. “Perhaps Chris Evans is in truth a great actor but he plays Captain America like he’s a big dumb hunk of s---,” Evans read out as he exploded into laughter.

"With Turkey Day just around the corner, store shelves are already lined with Christmas decorations and retailers across the country are preparing for Black Friday and its assortment of clearance sales.  We also have another long list of new TV shows, movies and Netflix Originals headed to the streaming service this December, including some very big releases---and no, I'm not talking about Bride of Chucky, though that scary movie is arriving next month just a tad late for Halloween.  Fortunately, Netflix subscribers have plenty of great content to look forward to. Let's take a look at some highlights before moving on to the big list of releases.  Undoubtedly the biggest release of the month is Avengers: Infinity War (pictured above) which lands on Netflix Christmas Day. Watching Thanos do battle against the arrayed forces of good on our planet and across the galaxies should be a nice way to relax after Christmas dinner. It should also get audiences in the mood for Avengers 4 which is slated for a May 3rd 2019 theatrical release. I liked Infinity War a lot more than Age of Ultron, though I did have a few quibbles with the film.  I'm even more excited for the release of the eighth and final season of Voltron: Legendary Defender, though the ""final"" part is kind of bumming me out. All good things must come to an end, but I feel like the show was really hitting its stride in Season 7 and it's so soon now that it will all be coming to an end. Just 13 episodes remain. If you're not watching Voltron on Netflix, you really should be. It's fun for kids and grown-ups alike.  Other fantastical fare for December includes 2004's Hellboy (December 1st) and the 2009 sci-fi drama District 9 (Dec 4th) a clever dystopian film that cuts rather close to the bone.  Perhaps just as exciting---if not more so---than Voltron, we have Season 1 of 3 Below: Tales of Arcadia which comes to Netflix on December 21st. This is the second series in Guillermo del Toro's animated project that began with the absolutely wonderful Trollhunters. We were introduced to the star characters of 3 Below in the final few episodes of that show. I'm so excited to see what happens here. I adored Trollhunters as did my kids. This time around, instead of trolls we get aliens. Should be neat.  Here's the trailer:  I'm also looking forward to the 4-part miniseries Watership Down, produced by Netflix and the BBC. The animated show includes voice actors like Sir Ben Kingsley (Gandhi), John Boyega (Star Wars) and many more. I remember the original movie adaptation of the excellent book frightening me quite a lot. Rabbits aren't supposed to be this twisted. It lands on Netflix on Christmas Day.  For more comedic titles both Friday and Friday After Next hit Netflix on December 1st. The hilarious British zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead lands the same day.  Meanwhile, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, a Netflix original that follows fairly close on the heels of Disney's live-action Jungle Book, finds its way to the streaming service on December 7th. The movie was directed by Andy Serkis (Gollum from Lord of the Rings, Snoke in the new Star Wars movies, Caesar in Planet of the Apes, and so on and so forth) and was originally a Warner Bros. film slated for theatrical release.  The rights were sold to Netflix, however, so we can save a buck or two and see this from the living room couch. I'm honestly not sure what to expect, but I have nothing but admiration for Serkis as a creative. There's a bunch of big names attached as voice actors, but I'm particularly glad to see The Americans star Mathhew Rhys who was simply outstanding in that show (as was Keri Russell.)  Here's the trailer:  I think it looks quite good---and quite different from The Jungle Book.  There's tons more, including a plethora of new Netflix Originals. Here's everything coming to Netflix in December 2018:  December 1st  Memories of Alhambra (Season 1)  8 Mile (2002)  Astro Boy (2009)  Battle (2018) Netflix Original Movie  Bride of Chucky (1998)  Christine (1983)  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009)  Crossroads: One Two Jaga (2018) Netflix Original Movie  Friday (1995)  Friday After Next (2002)  Hellboy (2004)  Man vs Wild with Sunny Leone (Season 1)  Meet Joe Black (1998)  My Bloody Valentine (2009)  Next Friday (2000)  Reindeer Games (2000)  Seven Pounds (2008)  Shaun of the Dead (2004)  Terminator Salvation (2009)  The Big Lebowski (1998)  The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass (Season 5)  The Last Dragon (1985)  The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997)  December 2nd  The Lobster (2015)  December 3rd  Blue Planet (Season 1)  Hero Mask (Season 1) Netflix Original Anime  The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot (Season 2) Netflix Original Series  December 4th  District 9 (2009)  December 6th  Happy!

Despite their undeniable chemistry, Underwood and Fisher couldn’t see much more of each other right away, considering the country crooner was based in Nashville and the National Hockey League star lived in Canada. “I mean, can I make dating more difficult?” Underwood recalled on VH1’s Behind the Music. “Let’s get a hockey guy who lives in another country. Awesome.”  They began long-distance dating, which consisted of regular phone calls — before eventually reuniting in person once more three months later.	0
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated / Source: Associated Press  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is telling ""Tonight Show"" host Jimmy Fallon to ""be a man"" and stop ""whimpering"" about the personal anguish he felt over the backlash he received after messing up Trump's hair during a 2016 campaign appearance on the late-night talk show.  Fallon recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he ""made a mistake"" on the Sept. 15, 2016, episode and would do it differently.  During that interview with the presidential candidate, Fallon thanked Trump ""for giving us the material that we are doing"" and said he has been ""amazing to follow"" because ""you say some shocking things that I cannot even believe.""  ""But I'm trying not to anyway,"" Trump replied.  Fallon's latest comments, however, didn’t appear to sit well with Trump.  The president tweeted Sunday:  Fallon responded on Twitter with a nod to the plight of young immigrants caught up in administration policies.  ""In honor of the President’s tweet I’ll be making a donation to RAICES in his name,"" Fallon said, referring to a nonprofit organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrant children, families and refugees in Texas.  The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, is the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas.

"Ronald Lyle Goldman (July 2, 1968 – June 12, 1994) was an American restaurant waiter and a friend of Nicole Brown Simpson; they were killed in 1994 at her Brentwood, Los Angeles home. Nicole's ex-husband, O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of their murders in 1995, but found liable for both deaths in a 1997 civil suit.  Early life [ edit ]  Goldman was born on July 2, 1968. He grew up in the community of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, near Chicago. His parents divorced in 1974 when he was six and, after spending a brief time in the custody of his mother, Sharon (Fohrman) Rufo, he was raised by his father, Fred Goldman, and lived with him and his younger sister, Kim Goldman.[2][3]  Goldman grew up Jewish.[4][5] He attended high school at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. He was a student at Illinois State University for one semester (where he planned to major in psychology) and a pledge to Sigma Nu fraternity before he followed his family to southern California at age 18.[6]  When younger, Goldman had worked as a camp counselor and had volunteered to help disabled children.[7][8]  In California [ edit ]  While living in Los Angeles, Goldman took some classes at Pierce College.[7] He learned to surf and enjoyed playing beach volleyball, rollerblading, nightclubbing,[9] and working out.  Upon arriving in California, he lived independently from his family and supported himself by working as an employment headhunter and tennis instructor. He then worked a string of waiter jobs.[7] He also occasionally did work as a model for Barry Zeldes, owner of Z90049 (the store next to the California Pizza Kitchen in Brentwood Gardens, where he had worked before Mezzaluna).[6] Not long before his death, he had earned an Emergency Medical Technician's license but decided not to pursue that career.[7]  Instead, Goldman told friends that he wanted to open a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood area.[7] He had shared with friends his vision of opening a future restaurant or bar characterized not by a name, but by the ankh, an Egyptian religious symbol of life that matched the tattoo on his shoulder.[6] According to his friend, Jeff Keller, he wanted to learn all facets of the restaurant-bar business, and occasionally worked as a promoter[6] at a Century City dance club called Tripps.[7] For Memorial Day, he participated with a group of event promoters in organizing a party at Renaissance, a club and restaurant on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.[6]  Goldman had also expressed aspirations to act and to be on a show, and he appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show Studs in 1992.[10]  Friendship with Nicole Brown [ edit ]  According to a June 15, 1994 Los Angeles Times article published three days after his death, Goldman probably met Brown six weeks before they were killed, when he borrowed her Ferrari. They grew increasingly close, accompanying each other to dance clubs, and meeting for coffee and dinner during the month-and-a-half before they died. According to police and friends, their relationship was platonic. According to the article, he had borrowed her car when he met his friend, Craig Clark, for lunch. According to Clark, he told him it was her car, but that he did not say she was his girlfriend. ""He said they were friends.""[11]  Death [ edit ]  On the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Goldman was a waiter at Mezzaluna Trattoria, a restaurant located at 11750 San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. Brown had called there to report that her mother, Juditha Brown, had accidentally left her sunglasses on the table.[11] After a quick search, they were discovered in the gutter outside the restaurant. Although he had not served her table, he agreed to take them to her home after work.  Before returning the sun glasses, Goldman stopped at his apartment, located at 11663 Gorham Avenue in Brentwood. He had after-work plans with his friend, Stewart Tanner, Mezzaluna's bartender, who said: ""He was going to go home and change and then we were going to go out."" The Los Angeles Times reports, ""Goldman punched out at 9:33 pm and stayed another 15 minutes to have a bottled water at the bar. Then he left, still in his uniform, black pants and white shirt, his tie shed. He carried the glasses that Brown wanted to be returned to her. 'I'll see you later,' he called to Tanner as he walked out.""[6]  When Goldman arrived at Brown's residence, at 875 South Bundy Drive, he was stabbed to death along with her, on the walkway leading to the condominium. He was just a few weeks shy of his 26th birthday.[6] During a reconstruction of the events, the police came to believe he had arrived during or shortly after Nicole's death.[citation needed]  His body, along with Brown's, was found shortly after midnight, when police arrived at the crime scene.  Goldman is buried at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.[12]  Trials and aftermath [ edit ]  Simpson was tried for the murders of both Brown and Goldman. In October 1995, after a public trial that lasted nearly nine months, he was acquitted. In a 1997 civil trial, a jury found him liable for the wrongful death of Goldman and awarded $19.5 million in damages to his family. Simpson was subsequently jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008.[13][14]  The rights to Simpson's book, If I Did It, a first-person account of how he would have committed the murders had he committed them, were awarded to the Goldman family in August 2007. They were granted the proceeds from the book in 2007 as part of the $33.5 million civil jury award against him they had been trying to collect for over a decade. They own the copyright, media rights, and movie rights.[15]  They also acquired Simpson's name, likeness, life story, and right of publicity in connection with the book, according to court documents, ensuring he would not be able to profit from the book. After renaming the book If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, the Goldman family published it in September 2007 through Beaufort Books.[16]  Foundation [ edit ]  The Goldman family contributed a portion of proceeds from the If I Did It book sales to the newly founded Ron Goldman Foundation for Justice.[17] It provides grants for multiple organizations and programs that provide resources to victims and survivors of violent crimes.[18] One of the largest donors to the foundation is Las Vegas executive Mark Goldman, Fred's first cousin.  Portrayals [ edit ]  Goldman was portrayed by Paul Witten in the TV movie The O. J. Simpson Story. He was portrayed by Russ Russo in Reenactment of the Century. He will be portrayed by Oliver Walker in Joshua Newton’s upcoming 2019 film Nicole & O.J..  See also [ edit ]"	0
Please be seated for the most important announcement about the royal wedding: Meghan Markle's dog, Guy, was just in Windsor with the Queen. The bride-to-be's beagle was seen living his best life yesterday, peeking out the window while hitching a ride with her Majesty. (They're carpool buddies now. No big deal.)  We haven't even seen Meghan alone in a car with the sovereign, but here's Guy, four legged and all, riding in the back seat with the Queen.    A friend kindly alerted me to a very sweet moment we missed yesterday - the Queen travelling with Meghan's beagle guy spotted by the talented Lainey Gossip https://madaboutmeghan.blogspot.con/2018/05/live-blog-day-before-wedding.html pic.twitter.com/zpQbtg8YeQ — Mad About Meghan (@MadAboutMeghan) May 18, 2018  Much like his mom, Guy has been on an pretty incredible journey over the past few years. Before Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was going to be put down by a shelter in Kentucky after he was discovered in the woods but no one wanted to take him home, according to The Guardian.  He was then taken in by Dolores Doherty, who runs A Dog's Dream Rescue, an Ontario-based charity that saves beagles on the kill list in the US and brings them to Canada for refuge.  After Guy traveled a 500-mile journey to the border, Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Surely enough, Markle turned out to be one of the hopeful dog owners at the event.    Guy has moved to London with Meghan, a Kensington Palace rep confirmed in November. Markle's other dog, Bogart, couldn't make the trip across the pond due to his old age, The Guardian adds.  Queen Elizabeth II with one of her corgis in 1970 Getty Images  A love of dogs is something Markle shares with her grandmother-in-law, who's known to be very fond of corgis. Just last month, Her Majesty's last corgi, Willow, passed away at the age of 14. Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.  Markle also instantly connected with the Queen's dogs, saying they laid happily at her feet during tea when she first met them. “For 33 years, [I’ve been] barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails,” Harry recalled in their first interview together.  Here's to hoping Guy carpools with the Queen again to the wedding tomorrow.	0
"BRAD Pitt has apologised to Jennifer Aniston for leaving her for Angelina Jolie.  The actor famously left the Friends star after meeting Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr and Mrs Smith, but since splitting from Ange last year he is reportedly determined to right any wrongs he made in the past.  Splash News 8 Brad Pitt has said sorry to Jennifer Aniston, according to reports  AFP 8 Brad and Jen were married from 2000 to 2005  Getty - Contributor 8 Jennifer was dumped for Angelina Jolie  A source told In Touch Weekly: “He’s been determined to apologise for everything he put her through, and that’s exactly what he did.  “It was the most intimate conversation Brad and Jen have ever had.”  The apology was reportedly incredibly difficult for Jennifer, 48, to hear after all these years.  “Jen was overcome with emotion. All the hurt feelings and resentment she’d suppressed for years came flooding to the surface, and she broke down in tears,” the source revealed.  “He apologised to Jen for being an absentee husband, for being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for leaving her for Angelina.”  It’s thought the former couple have now reached a ‘level of closeness’ they never thought possible following their bitter split in 2005.

Return to the red room.  We still don’t know what’s in store for us when “Twin Peaks” makes its long-awaited return next month, but we do finally have some new footage — kind of. Showtime has released a new teaser for the series, and though the 30-second ad consists of nothing more than a few establishing shots, it does serve to remind that this truly is happening and is just a few weeks away.  READ MORE: ‘Twin Peaks’ New Teaser Sums Up the First Two Seasons in Less Than Three Minutes — Watch  Carrying the tagline “Something old is new again…,” the teaser returns us to a few familiar locations: the red room, the sheriff’s department, the Double-R Diner. We don’t actually see anybody — most of the main cast is returning, with a few notable exceptions; there are also a number of new additions — suggesting that they must all be in another place.

Much like a certain Amazon goddess with a lasso, there are no heights that director Patty Jenkins can’t scale. Her blockbuster “Wonder Woman,” which has grossed a staggering $821 million worldwide since it opened in the summer, has become a rallying call for women everywhere and a beacon of empowerment in a Donald Trump-led world. Beyond all the Instagram posts of little girls decked out in “WW” regalia while seeing the film and an endorsement from Hillary Clinton, Jenkins recently cracked another glass ceiling. She’ll be directing “Wonder Woman 2” for a reported $7 million to $9 million, a record salary for a female filmmaker.  As she negotiated the terms of her contract with Warner Bros. over several months, Jenkins was conscious of what earning a big paycheck would mean. “You’re of course aware of the money,” says Jenkins on a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles. “But I’ve never been more aware of a duty than I was in this deal. I was extremely aware that I had to make sure I was being paid what the male equivalent would be.”  CREDIT: Art Streiber for Variety  According to recent studies, women only earn roughly 80 cents to every dollar that men get. The pay gap is evident in all corners of society, even Hollywood, where A-list actresses such as Jennifer Lawrence and Charlize Theron have had to fight to be compensated the same as their male peers. But until now, there’s never been an A-list female director with as much clout as Jenkins. Other women behind big live-action tentpoles, such as Catherine Hardwicke (“Twilight”) and Sam Taylor-Johnson (“Fifty Shades of Grey”), didn’t return for second installments, and the studios quickly replaced them with male directors.  “Women who have not been in a system that allows them to build up the same level of pay as men are not able to be paid the same as men forever if that’s the way it continues,” Jenkins says. “You have to ask for it to happen, and you have to ask when you’re the appropriate person.” She points to Theron, who starred in her 2003 independent film “Monster” and won an Oscar for the role. “I knew when Charlize had to do it on ‘Snow White and the Huntsman,’ and I felt that it was my job to do it here.”  Gal Gadot, the star of “Wonder Woman,” was cheering Jenkins on. “She is definitely paving the way for so many other female directors,” Gadot says. “I think it was very important that she fought to get the best deal. You got to walk the walk and talk the talk.”  Despite the results of the presidential election and women’s marches throughout the country, Jenkins never imagined that “Wonder Woman” would touch such a nerve. “I didn’t really start to make the connection about the lightning rod it was going to hit until it had opened,” says Jenkins, who gets stopped by strangers who profess how much the movie has meant to them. “I assumed that it would be seen just as a superhero film.” She’s in awe of all the high-profile groupies that she’s collected along the way. “When you hear about people like Hillary Clinton or Dwayne Johnson talking about you in the press, it’s like, ‘What!’ It’s so crazy and lovely.”  Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot share a moment on the set of “Wonder Woman.”  Courtesy of Warner Bros/Clay Enos  As Wonder Woman has resurfaced as a cultural icon, Jenkins has been the brains behind the movement. “I’ve become more well-known than I ever thought I would,” Jenkins says. “I didn’t think I would be getting this much attention.” Acting as an ambassador for the disenfranchised is a responsibility that Jenkins doesn’t take lightly. “I think the legacy of ‘Wonder Woman’ is a different kind of hero, one that hits the same marks but also really is about love and empowerment in a slightly different way,” she says. “I think that’s why I love that people wear her outfit. People who are struggling in some sort of way or don’t identify with the world they live in can often find themselves in Wonder Woman.”  Although some critics have read “Wonder Woman” as a feminist manifesto — when our hero meets her love interest, Steve (Chris Pine), she keeps her clothes on, while he’s naked — Jenkins didn’t think about it in those terms. “Not at all,” she says. “And that is the success of feminism. I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where you’re so feminist, you’re not thinking about it at all. Where you’re like, ‘Of course this superhero is the greatest superhero of all time. Oh, she’s a woman? I wasn’t even thinking about that!’”  Not everybody has been a fan of “Wonder Woman.” After James Cameron publicly bashed the movie with a misogynistic shrug, Jenkins shot back with her own statement on social media. “I actually was not upset at all,” Jenkins says. “Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. But if you’re going to debate something in a public way, I have to reply that I think it’s incorrect.” Did Cameron ever reach out to apologize? “No,” she says.  Jenkins worked in Hollywood as a focus puller and a camera operator in her 20s. She was among the small group of women doing a man’s job, but she wasn’t so aware of it. “I never thought about the fact that I was the only woman,” she says. Even so, she thinks it’s important to mentor other women as they try to climb the industry ladder. “I definitely do,” says Jenkins. “But also, I feel a real obligation to be open to help everyone. I really think that ‘Wonder Woman’ is a loving character to all.”  There’s been a lot of talk about why 14 years elapsed between her first film and “Wonder Woman.” Jenkins says that it was mostly her decision, because she wanted to be at home at night with her son and her husband. And it’s not as if she wasn’t working. She took on TV projects like directing the pilot of “The Killing.” “When you have a little baby, directing a feature where you’re gone every few years is not the easiest thing to sync up,” Jenkins says. “I know people who have done it. It wasn’t something I chose to do.”  I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where you’re so feminist, you’re not thinking about it at all.”  PATTY JENKINS  All the speculation about her career is understandable. The industry still has a dismal record when hiring women directors in the movies: Only 7% of the top 250 films of 2016 were directed by women, and that number gets smaller when you look at blockbusters. Next spring, Disney will release Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time,” which has a budget north of $100 million. But the list of directors attached to the “Star Wars” franchise is all-male, even with a female producer (Kathleen Kennedy) in charge. “It would depend on the project,” Jenkins says when asked if she’d want to direct a “Star Wars” movie.  In the Oscars race, not a single woman director has been nominated since Kathryn Bigelow became the first to win in the category in 2010. Warner Bros. is campaigning Jenkins as part of a robust Oscar push for “Wonder Woman” — if she’s nominated, she’ll be the first director of a comic-book movie to be recognized. “There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be considered,” she says of the Academy embracing comic-book adaptations. At least there’s been some progress: This is the first time in recent memory that there’s more than one woman — including Dee Rees (“Mudbound”) and Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”) — with a real chance of being nominated for best director.  Jenkins was able to negotiate her groundbreaking deal with Warner Bros. because the studio didn’t lock her down to multiple chapters. She had been in talks for “Wonder Woman,” but the studio offered the job to another filmmaker. After Michelle MacLaren exited due to creative differences, Jenkins signed on, without committing to a sequel. “They could have tied me up earlier,” she says. “I wouldn’t have wanted that.” Even though she wasn’t on board for a second movie, she kept envisioning it while making the first. (She’s been working on a treatment with DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns.) “I think she has a really clear and fun and compelling place that she’s taking the story,” says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chief Toby Emmerich.  Jenkins directs a scene in the 2003 film “Monster.” Charlize Theron, who played serial killer Aileen Wuornos, won an Oscar for the lead role.  Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock  One of the mantras associated with Wonder Woman — “Life is tough but so am I” — could easily apply to Jenkins’ own upbringing. Her father, William T. Jenkins, was an Air Force captain. He fought in Vietnam and later ran maneuvers out of a military base in England; his family joined him on all his adventures overseas. In interviews, Jenkins has talked a lot about how the heroism of her dad shaped “Wonder Woman.” She even has a dedication to him in the film’s closing credits.  But what she doesn’t talk about much is that he died, at 31, when she was only 7. “He passed away after taking off from a runway exactly like the one that Steve takes off on,” Jenkins says, referring to Wonder Woman’s boyfriend. “He crashed in the ocean.” She’s still not sure exactly what happened. “Nobody knows. He was in the middle of a NATO mock dogfight. They crash a lot. You’re doing a tricky maneuver.”  Her father’s spirit was on the “Wonder Woman” set, even if she didn’t always reference him directly. Gadot says she thought of Jenkins’ dad when she saw the film for the first time, especially during the climactic scene where Steve makes the ultimate sacrifice for the woman he loves. “I think that even in the short time that he was present in her life, he had a lot of effect on who she became,” Gadot says.  The death of her father framed Jenkins’ outlook in many ways. “It’s part of why I think I wanted to make movies,” she says. “I wanted to experience wonder somewhere. I didn’t think I would experience it in real life.”  A few months after her dad passed away, Jenkins remembers a cross-country road trip from Kansas to San Francisco in a VW bug. “My mom” — who would put herself through school to become an environmental scientist — “dropped my sister and I at the movie theater to wait out this snowstorm,” Jenkins says. They watched the original “Superman,” starring Christopher Reeve. “I remember everything about the experience of seeing it,” Jenkins says. “It really hit me in that way of exactly what I think superheroes were designed to do — to inspire you to metaphorically imagine the superhero within.”  That movie gave a grieving young girl some hope. It also provided her with a clear goal. “Seriously, that’s the part I can’t believe,” Jenkins says. “I always thought, because of ‘Superman,’ one day I want to make a movie that makes other people feel like that movie made me feel. The fact that that’s come true is so stunning.”  Watch a behind-the-scenes video of Jenkins’ Power of Women L.A. cover shoot.	0
The Dutch King Has Been Living A Secret Double Life As An Airline Pilot  Breaking news today implicates the leader of one of the world’s most respected democracies in a scandal involving years of deception right underneath the noses of the very people he’s meant to serve.  No — I’m not talking about the orange-skinned man living in the White House, I’m talking about the leader of the House of Orange, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. And as far as “scandals” go, it’s downright adorable.  You see, King Willem-Alexander has been piloting KLM aircraft incognito for the last 21 years. Really. Per Sky News:  The king of the Netherlands has revealed he has been living a secret double life as a co-pilot for a commercial airline.  For 21 years, King Willem-Alexander has taken to the skies twice a month to ferry passengers around on short-haul services for the Dutch airline KLM. Although travellers may have recognised the monarch’s voice as he updated them on weather conditions and their time of arrival, the royal’s presence was never revealed. This is your captain (and your King) speaking…  The BBC adds that, prior to ascending to the throne in 2013, it was an open secret that the then-Prince would appear as a so-called “guest pilot” on KLM in order to maintain his pilot’s license, but:  What was not clear was that he was co-piloting passenger flights incognito, twice a month as king, often with KLM Captain Maarten Putman. The Dutch government said last month that he had flown Fokker 70 aircraft for both the government and KLM Cityhopper service, and that the plane was being replaced this year with a 737. Cityhopper flights are aimed mainly at business travellers in dozens of European destinations, particularly in the UK, Germany and Norway.  Well, if I didn’t love KLM and the Netherlands enough as it is already, this is the cherry on top. How charming, thoughtful, quirky and so thoroughly Dutch of the King, and KLM, to “secretly” fly passengers on short hops around Europe. Best of all, few seem to have been the wiser despite his PA announcements!  I’ve flown with royalty before (well… Motown royalty), but never by royalty!  If you regularly fly on KLM, do you think you might have been flown by the King of the Netherlands before?	0
Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'	1

Golden State Warriors basketball player Stephen Curry was seen in the crowd, as was former Vice President Joe Biden — who shook hands and posed for photos with HQ trivia host Scott Rogowsky.  Pennsylvania native Miles Teller, 30, was on the field before the game too, posing in his Eagles gear and chatting with Cooper.

"The Fifty Shades Darker press tour will begin soon, but fans might be disappointed as the lead actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have refused to promote the film, gossip websites say so.  Also Read: Are Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan expecting first child?  According to reports, Johnson and Dornan have refused to promote the film. Fans of the novel are of the opinion that Johnson and Dornan are ""horribly miscast"" for the lead actors' role – Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.  ""Fans should at least be seeing Jamie and Dakota out and about, if not talking to the press about the movie. Even paparazzi are having a hard time locating them,"" Celebs Dirty Laundry reported quoting sources.  According to reports, Dornan is trying to shed Christian Grey's image from the Fifty Shades franchise, as he is looking for different roles in Hollywood for months now. Dornan does not want his fans to remember him only for his role in the Fifty Shades franchise.  However, Gossip Cop has debunked the news and said that Dornan and Johnson are gearing up to promote the film, which is set for Valentine's Day release.  Fifty Shades Darker has been in the spotlight again for the wrong reasons. Earlier, the Celebs Dirty Laundry reported that critics are not happy with the sex scenes in the movie due to which Johnson and Dornan are forced to reshoot the scenes.  Critics who saw the film laughed off watching Johnson and Dornan's intimate scenes. Though Johnson and Dornan tried hard to maintain the chemistry, they could not perform up to the mark, thus making the second instalment film worse than the first part.  However, Gossip Cop also debunked this report as well. The website quoting sources reported that the makers have wrapped up the film and the lead pair is not shooting the sex scenes again."	1

Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.	1
More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today’s New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  “I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we’re ‘dropping’ episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  “Meanwhile, I’m still happily married (after three years!) and I’m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,” she continues. “His are pretty lame so far. I’m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie’s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I’ll be able to announce soon. I’m addicted to work!	1
