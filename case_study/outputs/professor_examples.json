    "explanation": "The fake article's neutral, report-style tone caused its semantic embedding to be almost indistinguishable from real news. Traditional transformers rely purely on semantic similarity and are misled by the professional writing style. GemGNN's multi-view approach reveals subtle inconsistencies - while overall neighbors lean Real, sub-view 3 captures suspicious patterns that unified embeddings miss."

    "explanation": "This case reveals the power and risk of the multi-view approach. The HAN model's attention mechanism correctly assigns higher weight to sub-views 2 and 3 which capture the legitimate investigative reporting style, while sub-view 1 picks up on sensational language that might appear in fake news. Baseline models get confused by this mixed signal and incorrectly classify it as fake."
